 Osteomyelitis<disease> is an inflammatory bone<disease> infection<disease> that is caused most commonly by the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>. Research into staphylococcal induced bone<disease> infection<disease> is typically conducted using traditional 2D in vitro culture settings , which is not fully representative of the dynamic in vivo environment. In this study we utilised a collagen glycosaminoglycan scaffold , previously developed for bone tissue engineering , as a representative 3D model of infection. The scaffold resisted degradation and retained its pore structure , which is important for cellular function and survival , when seeded with both cells and bacteria. Using this model , we showed that in the presence of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , osteoblast proliferation was reduced over 21 days. Interestingly however these cells were more metabolically active compared to the uninfected cells and demonstrated increased mineralisation. Protein A ( SpA) is a virulence factor found on the surface of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and has been shown to interact with osteoblasts. When SpA was removed from the surface of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , the osteoblasts show comparable activity with the uninfected cells-demonstrating the importance of SpA in the interaction between bone cells and S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>. Our results suggest that infected osteoblasts are capable of over-compensating for bone loss and bone destruction by increasing mineralisation in a 3D environment , key elements required for ensuring bone strength. It also reinforces our previously established result that S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> SpA is a critical mediator in osteomyelitis<disease> and might be a potential novel drug target to treat osteomyelitis<disease> by preventing the interaction between S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and osteoblasts.
