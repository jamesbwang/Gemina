 Air displacement plethysmography ( ADP) has been widely utilised to track body composition because it is considered to be practical , reliable , and valid. Pea Pod is the infant version of ADP that accommodates infants up to the age of 6 months and has been widely utilised to assess the body composition of full-term infants , and more recently pre-term infants. The primary goal of this comprehensive review is to 1) discuss the accuracy/reproducibility of Pea Pod in both full- and pre-term infants , 2) highlight and discuss practical challenges and potential sources of measurement errors in relation to Pea Pod operating principles , and 3) make suggestions for future research direction to overcome the identified limitations.
