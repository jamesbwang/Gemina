 Although Nitrobacter winogradskyi is an important chemoorganotrophic organism for the study of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria physiology as well as nitrification , until now , the mixotrophic medium for this organism growth has not been optimized , comprehensively. In this study , we aimed to improve the growth medium of N. winogradskyi using the one-factor-at-a-time ( NaNO Due to the extremely slow growth rate and the low growth yield of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and NOB ( nitrite-oxidizing bacteria) , nitrification is still the rate-limiting step of nitrogen cycle in the current research. Nitrobacter winogradskyi , an important NOB , participates in the second step of nitrification in water and soil. This study reported an optimized culture condition for N. winogradskyi , which increased the growth yield by 5 Â· 06 times than that in the basal medium and uncovered the potential mechanism. We expect our study will contribute to the research on water and soil nitrogen cycle. In addition , the optimized culture conditions have the potential to be suitable for the chemoorganotrophic growth of other nitrifiers.
