 The ability to manipulate small objects with focused laser beams opens a broad spectrum of opportunities in fundamental and applied studies , for which precise control over mechanical path and stability is required. Although conventional optical tweezers are based on refractive optics , the development of compact trapping devices that could be integrated within fluid cells is in high demand. Here , a plasmonic polarization-sensitive metasurface-based lens , embedded within a fluid , is demonstrated to provide several stable trapping centers along the optical axis. The position of a particle is controlled with the polarization of the incident light , interacting with plasmonic nanoscale patch antennas , organized within overlapping Fresnel zones of the lens. While standard diffractive optical elements face challenges in trapping objects in the axial direction outside the depth of focus , bifocal Fresnel meta-lens demonstrates the capability to manipulate a bead along a 4 Î¼m line. An additional fluorescent module , incorporated within the optical trapping setup , was implemented and enabled the accurate mapping of optical potentials via a particle-tracking algorithm. Auxiliary micro- and nanostructures , integrated within fluidic devices , provide numerous opportunities to achieve flexible optomechanical manipulation , including transport , trapping , and sorting , which are in high demand for lab-on-a-chip applications and many others.
