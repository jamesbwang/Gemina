 Several studies reported platelet-to-lymphocytes ratio ( PLR) , neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR) and red blood cell distribution width ( RDW) were associated with the mid-term survival or cancer stage in pancreatic cancer. However , the relationship between these markers and the long-term prognosis of pancreatic cancer is still unknown. We investigated the relationship between PLR , NLR , RDW , and the long-term prognosis of pancreatic cancer.We included 182 pancreatic cancer patients who received operation at Linzi District People 's Hospital between August 2010 and January 2017. PLR , NLR , and RDW control data was obtained from 150 health volunteers from January 2011 to January 2017. Blood biochemical data before operation , preoperative computed tomography information , and pathological data of the pancreatic cancer patients were retrospectively collected for further analysis. Independent long-term prognostic significance of PLR , NLR , and RDW were analyzed in pancreatic cancer patients.PLR , NLR , and RDW were significantly increased in pancreatic cancer group compared with the control. Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve analysis showed the optimal cut-off values of PLR , NLR , and RDW were 150 , 1.73 , and 13.2 respectively. Overall survival ( OS) analysis showed pancreatic cancer patients with PLR ≥ 150 ( median time , 24 vs 37.5 months , P = .005) or RDW ≥ 13.2 ( median time , 27 months vs 37.5 months , P = .018) had lower postoperative 5 year OS compared with pancreatic cancer patients with PLR < 150 or RDW < 13.2. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression analysis for postoperative 5 year OS data showed PLR ≥ 150 ( HR = 2.451 , 95 % CI 1.215-4.947; P = .012) was still associated with the OS independently. Disease free survival ( DFS) analysis showed pancreatic cancer patients with PLR ≥ 150 ( median time , 24 months vs 38 months , P = .002) or RDW ≥ 13.2 ( median time , 24 months vs 37.5 months , P = .006) had lower postoperative 5 year DFS compared with pancreatic cancer patients with PLR < 150 or RDW < 13.2. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression analysis for postoperative 5 year DFS data showed PLR ≥ 150 ( HR = 2.712 , 95 % CI 1.367-5.379; P = .004) was independently associated with the DFS.In the present study , we find hematological biomarkers PLR ≥ 150 is an independently predictive risk factor for the postoperative long-term prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Our study may provide a convenient way for the prognostic assessment of pancreatic cancer patients.
