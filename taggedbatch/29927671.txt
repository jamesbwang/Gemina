 We hypothesized that polypathology is more severe in older than younger mice during the acute phase following repetitive mild traumatic brain injury ( r-mTBI). Young and aged male and female mice transgenic for human tau ( hTau) were exposed to r-mTBI or a sham procedure. Twenty-four hours post-last injury , mouse brain tissue was immunostained for alterations in astrogliosis , microgliosis , tau pathology , and axonal injury. Quantitative analysis revealed a greater percent distribution of glial fibrillary acid protein and Iba-1 reactivity in the brains of all mice exposed to r-mTBI compared to sham controls. However , no noticeable difference was observed between the young and aged groups as initially hypothesized. With respect to axonal injury , the number of amyloid precursor protein-positive profiles was increased in young vs aged mice post r-mTBI. An increase in tau immunoreactivity was found in young and aged injured male hTau mice. We report the first evidence in our model that r-mTBI precipitates a complex sequelae of events in aged vs young hTau mice at an acute time point , typified by an increase in phosphorylated tau and astroglisosis , and a diminished microgliosis response and axonal injury. These findings suggest differential age-dependent effects in TBI pathobiology.
