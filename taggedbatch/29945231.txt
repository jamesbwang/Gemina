 Air pollution has a compelling history in the development of human cultures. Fossil fuels opened a new human cultural chapter of extraordinary technical and economic growth while bringing about noxious and unhealthful combustion byproducts to breathe. Toxicology saw its birth in the modern world with demonstrating the potential harmful effects of breathing smoke in its various forms. The empirical nature of toxicology provided insights and underpinnings to epidemiological studies providing biological plausibility and relative risk attributions. As toxicology evolves with its sister sciences , there will be gains in fundamental understandings of susceptibility and potential long-term risks of air pollution with revelation of potential interventions and remedies for those affected.
