 Flow fields in cerebral aneurysms<disease> can be measured in vivo with phase-contrast MRI ( 4D Flow MRI) , providing 3D anatomical magnitude images as well as 3-directional velocities through the cardiac cycle. The low spatial resolution of the 4D Flow MRI data , however , requires the images to be co-registered with higher resolution angiographic data for better segmentation of the blood vessel geometries to adequately quantify relevant flow descriptors such as wall shear stress or flow residence time. Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography ( TOF MRA) is a non-invasive technique for visualizing blood vessels without the need to administer contrast agent. Instead TOF uses the blood flow-related enhancement of unsaturated spins entering into an imaging slice as means to generate contrast between the stationary tissue and the moving blood. Because of the higher resolutions , TOF data are often used to assist with the segmentation process needed for the flow analysis and Computational Fluid Dynamics ( CFD) modeling. However , presence of slow moving and recirculating blood flow such as in brain aneurysms<disease> , especially regions where the blood flow is not perpendicular to the image plane , causes signal loss in these regions. In this work a 3D Curvelet Transform-based image fusion approach is proposed for signal loss artifact reduction of TOF volume data. Experiments show the superiority of the proposed approach in comparison to other multi-resolution 3D Wavelet-based image fusion methodologies. The proposed approach can further facilitate model-based fluid analysis and pre/post-operative treatment of patients with brain aneurysms<disease>.
