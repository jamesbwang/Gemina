 Silk is an especially appealing biomaterial due to its adaptable mechanical properties , allowing it to be used in a wide range of tissue engineering applications. However , processing conditions play a critical role in determining silk 's mechanical properties , biodegradability , and biocompatibility. While bulk properties of silk have been widely explored , focusing on microscopic features is becoming increasingly important , as modifications at this scale largely affect the resulting regenerative properties of the biomaterial. Structural changes caused by the silk source , extraction , and processing should be carefully considered , as they will affect the biocompatibility and degradability of silk fibroin. Processing techniques and physical properties of silk that make it an ideal material for many biomedical applications will be explored.
