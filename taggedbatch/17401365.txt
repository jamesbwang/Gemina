 Dysregulation of microRNA ( miRNA) expression has been linked to many human<disease> diseases<disease>; however , because of the challenges associated with RNA-targeted drug discovery , additional approaches are needed for probing miRNA biology. The emerging regulatory role of miRNA-binding proteins in miRNA maturation presents such an alternative strategy. Exploiting our laboratory 's click chemistry-based high-throughput screening ( HTS) technology , catalytic enzyme-linked click chemistry assay or cat-ELCCA , we have designed a modular method by which to discover new chemical tools for manipulating pre-miRNA-miRNA-binding protein interactions. Using the pre-let-7d-Lin28 interaction as proof-of-concept , the results presented demonstrate how HTS using cat-ELCCA can enable the discovery of small molecules targeting RNA-protein interactions.
