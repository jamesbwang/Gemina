 DNA-PAINT is an optical super-resolution microscopy method that can visualize nanoscale protein arrangements and provide spectrally unlimited multiplexing capabilities. However , current multiplexing implementations based on , for example , DNA exchange ( such as Exchange-PAINT) achieves multitarget detection by sequential imaging , limiting throughput. Here , we combine DNA-PAINT with single-molecule FRET and use the FRET efficiency as parameter for multiplexed imaging with high specificity. We demonstrate correlated single-molecule FRET and super-resolution on DNA origami structures , which are equipped with binding sequences that are targeted by pairs of dye-labeled oligonucleotides generating the FRET signal. We futher extract FRET values from single binding sites that are spaced just âˆ¼ 55 nm apart , demonstrating super-resolution FRET imaging. This combination of FRET and DNA-PAINT allows for multiplexed super-resolution imaging with low background and opens the door for accurate distance readout in the 1-10 nm range.
