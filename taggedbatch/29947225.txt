 The synthesis of the Lycopodium alkaloids , (-)- cermizine B , ( +)- serratezomine E , and ( +)- luciduline using phenylglycinol-derived tricyclic lactams as chiral scaffolds , is reported. The requisite lactams are prepared by a cyclocondensation reaction between ( R)- or ( S)- phenylglycinol and the substituted Î´-keto ester 11 , easily accessible from ( R)- pulegone. The factors governing the stereoselectivity of these cyclocondensation reactions are discussed. Key steps of the synthesis from the stereochemical standpoint are the stereoselective elaboration of the allyl substituent to the ( S) -2- ( piperidyl) methyl moiety and the stereoselective removal of the chiral inductor to give a cis-decahydroquinoline.
