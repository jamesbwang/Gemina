 Pericytes are perivascular cells that play important roles in the regulation of the blood-brain barrier ( BBB) properties. Pericyte-deficiency causes compromised BBB integrity and increase in permeability to different macromolecules mainly by upregulated transcytosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate pericyte involvement in the extent of small-molecular drug transport across the BBB. This was performed with five compounds: diazepam , digoxin , levofloxacin , oxycodone and paliperidone. Compounds were administered at low doses via subcutaneous injections as a cassette ( simultaneously) to pericyte-deficient Pdgfb
