 Green Infrastructure ( GI) has become increasingly important in urban stormwater management because of the effects of climate change and urbanization. To mitigate severe urban water-related problems , China is implementing GI at the national scale under its Sponge City Program ( SCP). The SCP is currently in a pilot period , however , little attention has been paid to the cost-effectiveness of GI implementation in China. In this study , an evaluation framework based on the Storm Water Management Model ( SWMM) and life cycle cost analysis ( LCCA) was applied to undertake integrated assessments of the development of GI for flood mitigation , to support robust decision making regarding sponge city construction in urbanized watersheds. A baseline scenario and 15 GI scenarios under six design rainfall events with recurrence intervals ranging from 2-100 years were simulated and assessed. Model simulation results confirmed the effectiveness of GI for flood mitigation. Nevertheless , even under the most beneficial scenario , the results showed the hydrological performance of GI was incapable of eliminating flooding. Analysis indicated the bioretention cell ( BC) plus vegetated swale ( VS) scenario was the most cost-effective GI option for unit investment under all rainfall events. However , regarding the maximum potential of the implementation areas of all GI scenarios , the porous pavement plus BC + VS strategy was considered most reasonable for the study area. Although the optimal combinations are influenced by uncertainties in both the model and the GI parameters , the main trends and key insights derived remain unaffected; therefore , the conclusions are relevant regarding sponge city construction within the study area.
