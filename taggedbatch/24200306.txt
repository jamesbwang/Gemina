 Human periodontal ligament stem cells ( hPDLSCs) have been shown to be a reliable source of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs). On the other hand , rabbits have been commonly used in preclinical trials for musculoskeletal research. However , there is a lack of sufficient data on using rabbit periodontal ligament stem cells ( rPDLSCs) for regenerative dentistry. This study , for the first time , comprehensively compared rPDLSCs against hPDLSCs in terms of clonogenicity , growth potential , multi-differential capacity and surface antigens. Periodontal ligament ( PDL) was obtained from the rabbit and human teeth. rPDL and hPDL cells were isolated from PDL using enzymatic digestion method. After culturing for 2 weeks , the cells were first analyzed microscopically. STRO-1 rPDL cells were broader and less elongated as compared to hPDL cells. STRO-1 Although rPDL cells manifested variable differences in expression of stem cell markers and multi-differential potential as compared to hPDL cells , they demonstrated the attributes of stemness. Further studies are also required to validate if the regenerative potential of rPDL cells is similar to rPDLSCs.
