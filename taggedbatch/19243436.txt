 An active and diverse soil biota is important for maintaining crop productivity and quality , and preservation of these traits is a major goal of sustainable farming. This study aimed at unravelling the impact of different management practices on soil fungal and bacterial biodiversity in vineyards as a model for permanent crops. Species diversity was assessed using an amplicon sequencing approach in a long-term field experiment in the Rheingau wine region of Germany where integrated , organic and biodynamic management practices had been in place for 10 years. Fungal community composition under integrated management differed significantly from organic and biodynamic management , whereas fungal species richness remained unaffected. Soil under integrated management had a significantly reduced bacterial species richness compared to organic , but community composition was similar to organically and biodynamically managed soils. Highest fungal richness was obtained under cover crop between rows in topsoil , arising from cover cropping and organic carbon supply.
