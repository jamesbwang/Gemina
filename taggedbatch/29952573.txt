 Total syntheses of the antibacterial alkaloids berberine , coptisine , and jatrorrhizine have been achieved in four steps through a unified route. The key step of this strategy is an efficient intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkoxyalkylation which , following oxidation , establishes the isoquinolinium core of these natural products. Herein , the design and development of this synthetic strategy , which has enabled the shortest and most efficient syntheses of these alkaloids reported to date , is described.
