 Although acquisition techniques have improved tremendously , the neuroscientific understanding of complex cognitive phenomena is still incomplete. One of the reasons for this shortcoming may be the lack of sophisticated signal processing methods. Complex cognitive phenomena usually involve various mental subprocesses whose temporal occurrence varies from trial to trial. Mostly , these mental subprocesses require large-scale integration processes between multiple brain areas that are most likely mediated by complex , non-linear phase coupling mechanisms. Consequently , a spatiotemporal analysis of complex , multivariate phase synchronization patterns on a single trial basis is necessary. This paper introduces the HEURECA method ( How to Evaluate and Uncover Recurring EEG Coupling Arrangements) that enables the dynamic detection of distinguishable multivariate functional connectivity states in the electroencephalogram. HEURECA adaptively divides a trial into segments of quasi-stable phase coupling topographies and assigns similar topographies to the same synchrostate cluster. HEURECA is evaluated by means of simulated data. The results show that it reliably reconstructs a time series of recurring phase coupling topographies and successfully gathers them into clusters of interpretable neural synchrostates. The advantages and unique features of HEURECA are further illustrated by investigating the popular complex cognitive phenomenon insight. Unlike existing methods , HEURECA detects complex phase relationships between more than two signals and is applicable to single trials. Since HEURECA is applicable to all kinds of circular data , it not only provides new insights into insight , but also into a variety of other phenomena in neuroscience , physics or other scientific fields.
