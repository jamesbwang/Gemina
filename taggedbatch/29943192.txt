 This phase II study evaluated the safety and clinical activity of pazopanib , a potent and mutlitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI) of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors ( VEGFRs) -1 , -2 and -3 , platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR)- α and β , and cKit , in combination with metronomic paclitaxel in patients with metastatic melanoma. Sixty chemotherapy-naive patients received pazopanib at a starting dose of 800 mg daily in combination with metronomic dosing of paclitaxel 80 mg/m The 6-month PFS rate was 68 % , with a 1-year OS rate of 48 %. Objective response rate was 37 % comprising one complete and 20 partial responses. Stable disease at 8 weeks was noted in 32 patients ( 55 %) with an overall clinical benefit rate of 93 %. Six-month median progression-free survival was 8 months and median OS was 12.7 months. The most frequently ( > 15 %) reported non-hematologic , treatment-related adverse events were fatigue<symptom> , diarrhea<disease><symptom> , hypertension , transaminitis and peripheral neuropathy. Treatment-related non-fatal bowel perforation , a known class effect , occurred in one patient. No significant association was noted between plasma levels of pazopanib and response. The combination of pazopanib and metronomic paclitaxel was well-tolerated , demonstrating significant activity in metastatic melanoma. Further evaluation of this combination is warranted.
