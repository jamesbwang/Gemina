 Micro leakage around the margins of a restoration is believed to be one of the main causes of postoperative sensitivity. Dental amalgam is a non-insulating material and has the potential to transfer heat and cold causing irritation of the pulp. Different dentin tubule sealers are used under amalgam restoration to compensate for this post-operative sensitivity. This study was conducted to compare the frequency of sensitivity in amalgam restorations using copal varnish and dentin adhesive liner ( dentin bonding agent). A total of 60 patients of either gender , aged 18-40 years having class 1 carries in posterior teeth were included. Teeth with restorations , dentinal sensitivity and patients taking analgesic drugs for chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> conditions were excluded. The selected patients were placed randomly into Group A ( copal varnish) & Group B ( dentin adhesive liner) , by using computer generated table of random numbers. Restored teeth were evaluated 1-month post operatively for sensitivity. Mean age was 25.63 ± 5.42 years. Out of 60 patients , 68.0 % were females and 32.0 % were males with a female to male ratio of 2:1. The mean post-operative pain score was 2.83 ± 2.79 in Group A and in Group B , it was 1.43 ± 2.14 with a p-value of 0.03. There was no pain on application of a cold stimulus in 14 ( 46.7 %) patients in Group A ( copal varnish) while in Group B ( Dentin adhesive) , no pain was seen in 23 ( 76.7 %) patients with p-value of 0.02. This study concluded that dentin adhesive liner ( dentin bonding agent) is better than copal varnish in reducing postoperative sensitivity in amalgam restorations.
