 Interleukin-1β ( IL-1β) is a critical inflammatory regulator in response to Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infection. However , the mechanism involved in the secretion of IL-1β during Mycoplasma<pathogen> hyopneumoniae infection is unclear. In this study , we demonstrated that Mycoplasma<pathogen> hyopneumoniae infection increased the secretion of mature-IL-1β ( m-IL-1β) , but not pro-IL-1β , in porcine alveolar macrophages. Moreover , Mycoplasma<pathogen> hyopneumoniae infection promoted the generation of autophagosomes , which attributed to the unconventional secretion of m-IL-1β. Further results revealed that Hsp90 was required for the entry of m-IL-1β into autophagosomes during Mycoplasma<pathogen> hyopneumoniae infection. The fusion of m-IL-1β-containing autophagosome and plasma membranes<symptom> was regulated by Sec22b and independent of lysosomal dysfunction. In conclusion , we provide evidence that Hsp90/Sec22b promotes the unconventional secretion of IL-1β through an autophagosomal carrier during Mycoplasma<pathogen> hyopneumoniae infection. The elucidation of the molecular and cellular machinery in Mycoplasma<pathogen> hyopneumoniae infected mammalian cells in this study suggests avenues for further study and applications and paves the way for novel therapeutic strategies to prevent tissue damage in mycoplasma-associated diseases.
