 Radical hydrophosphorylation of aliphatic terminal alkynes with H-phosphine oxides can produce the corresponding anti-Markovnikov alkenylphosphorus adducts in moderate yields. This method is a cleaner approach for the preparation of the corresponding alkenylphosphine oxides , since it avoids the use of a metal catalyst that sometimes is difficult to remove from the products.
