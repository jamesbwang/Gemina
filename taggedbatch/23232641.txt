 Renal<symptom> involvement<symptom> in type 2 diabetes is mainly due to diabetic nephropathy ( DN). Nevertheless , a sizable proportion of diabetic patients could actually have nondiabetic renal diseases ( NDRDs) or DN plus NDRDs. This study aimed to explore the pathological features of NDRD in diabetic patients and to assess the predictability of diagnosing NDRD ( ± DN) versus isolated DN on the basis of clinical parameters. Medical records of type 2 diabetes patients who underwent renal biopsy under suspicion of NDRD from January 2011 through November 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. A total of 101 patients were enrolled in this study. The most frequent indication for renal biopsy was recent onset of nephrotic syndrome<disease><symptom> ( 41 %) , followed by rapidly progressive renal<symptom> failure<symptom> ( 29 %) and active urinary sediment ( 21 %). On renal biopsy , 51 % of patients had isolated DN , 20 % had isolated NDRD and 29 % had DN plus NDRD. IgA nephropathy was the most common cause of isolated NDRD , whereas acute tubular necrosis<symptom> ( 39 %) and acute interstitial nephritis ( 33 %) were the main causes of NDRD superimposed on DN. Male gender , short-duration diabetes ( < 8 years) , lower glycated hemoglobin and active urinary sediment ( ≥ 10 red and white blood cells per high-power field) were independent predictors of NDRD according to multiple logistic regression analysis. Judicious use of renal biopsy revealed NDRD ( ± DN) in nearly half of type 2 diabetes patients with atypical renal presentation , especially in male patients with well-controlled diabetes , those who have had diabetes for a short duration and those with active urinary sediment.
