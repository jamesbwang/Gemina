 Cytoplasmic dynein is involved in diverse cell cycle-dependent functions regulated by several accessory factors , including Nde1 and Ndel1. Little is known about the role of these proteins in dynein cargo binding , and less is known about their cell cycle-- dependent dynein regulation. Using Nde1 RNAi , mutant cDNAs , and a phosphorylation site-specific antibody , we found a specific association of phospho-Nde1 with the late G2-M nuclear envelope and prophase to anaphase kinetochores , comparable to the pattern for the Nde1 interactor CENP-F. Phosphomutant-Nde1 associated only with prometaphase kinetochores and showed weaker CENP-F binding in in vitro assays. Nde1 RNAi caused severe delays in mitotic progression , which were substantially rescued by both phosphomimetic and phosphomutant Nde1. Expression of a dynein-binding-deficient Nde1 mutant reduced kinetochore dynein by half , indicating a major role for Nde1 in kinetochore dynein recruitment. These results establish CENP-F as the first well-characterized Nde1 cargo protein , and reveal phosphorylation control of Nde1 cargo binding throughout a substantial fraction of the cell cycle.
