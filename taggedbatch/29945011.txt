 To revaluate the cement distribution patterns and further investigate associations between cement distribution patterns and the occurrence rates of recompression in cemented vertebrae after percutaneous vertebroplasty ( PVP) for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures ( VCFs). A total of 224 patients with a mean age of 71.9 years were enrolled and treated with single-level PVP between June 2012 and July 2015. The mean follow-up time was 16.5 months. Data from medical records and radiographs were collected and analyzed. Cement distribution patterns were divided into four cement distribution patterns extending from the traditional two patterns: interlocked solid pattern ( LS) and uninterlocked solid pattern ( ULS); contiguous trabecular pattern ( CT) and discontiguous trabecular pattern ( DCT). Differences in treatment efficacy and the occurrence rates of recompression in cemented vertebrae were compared for both groups using the Wilcoxon 's rank sum test and chi-square test. Thirty-seven patients who underwent PVP developed recompression in cemented vertebrae. Recompression in cemented vertebrae was significantly more frequent in the ULS and DCT groups than in the LS and CT groups ( P < 0.05 or 0.001) , with the VAS score at the time of final follow-up was also significantly higher in the ULS and DCT groups ( P < 0.001). Significant associations were found between cement distribution patterns and recompression in cemented vertebrae , which affected the clinical outcome in patients after PVP. A higher incidence of recompression in cemented vertebrae was seen in patients with treated vertebrae exhibiting ULS pattern or DCT pattern.
