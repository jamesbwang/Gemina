 Previous meta-analyses of root caries<disease> incidence and increment studies reported different estimates due to the limited number of studies , heterogeneity and variations in studies included. Currently , new publications and approaches to handle heterogeneity are available. This research aims to systematically review and meta-analyse root caries<disease> incidence and increment , and use meta-regression to analyse heterogeneity. PUBMED and EMBASE databases were searched systematically. Longitudinal studies on root caries<disease> incidence and increment , published in English language prior to 2017 , were independently checked by two authors. A pooled incidence and increment of decayed/filled root surfaces ( DFS) was estimated and meta-regression analysis was performed by length of follow-up ( < 2 years; 2 years; 3-4years and â‰¥ 5 years) and study type ( observational population-based and clinical trial). Of 737 articles , 20 were included for meta-analysis. The annualised root caries<disease> incidence and increment were 18.25 % ( CI = 13.22 % -23.28 %) and 0.45 ( CI = 0.37-0.53) root DFS respectively. Length of follow-up influenced the estimates , but not the study type. The annual root DFS incidence and increment from studies < 2 years were 32.95 % ( CI = 29.13 % -36.77 %) and 0.64 ( CI = 0.38-0.89) root surfaces respectively. Studies with 5 + years follow-up , the annualised root caries<disease> incidence and increment were 9.4 % ( CI = 3.32 % -15.48 %) and 0.43 ( CI = 0.21-0.64) root surfaces respectively. Length of follow-up influenced root caries<disease> estimates due to a bias towards relatively healthier older adults retained in the study. Root caries<disease> increased over time even among the healthier older adults. The increase in root caries<disease> , even among the healthier older adults , should be considered by both clinicians and healthcare planners/policy makers in their provision of services.
