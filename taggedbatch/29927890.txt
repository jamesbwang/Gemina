Reliability , usefulness , and factorial validity of change-of-direction speed tests in adolescent basketball players. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-The purposes of this study were to ( 1) determine the reliability , usefulness , and factorial validity of change-of-direction speed ( CODS) tests in adolescent basketball players and ( 2) evaluate positional differences in test performances. Elite , adolescent male basketball players ( n = 53; 17.3 ± 1.0 years) completed 6 CODS tests: `` Lane Arrow Closeout , '' `` Lane Agility Drill , '' `` Reactive Shuttle Test , '' `` Run-Shuffle-Run , '' `` Compass Drill , '' and `` Modified 505 Test. '' Players completed 3 trials of each test. All tests demonstrated acceptable reliability ( intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.50-0.88; coefficient of variation: 5.1-7.9 %). The typical error ( TE) calculated for each test was above the smallest worthwhile change , rating the usefulness of all tests as marginal. The principal component factor analysis in all tests resulted in the extraction of one significant component that explained 74 % of the total variance across tests. Positional comparisons showed that backcourt ( guards) players performed better ( small to moderate differences) in all CODS tests compared with frontcourt ( forwards and centers) players. All tests were deemed reliable and valid in adolescent basketball players. The `` Lane Agility Drill '' and `` Run-Shuffle-Run '' tests seem the most appropriate to quantify changes in CODS possessing the lowest TE , whereas the `` Lane Arrow Closeout '' and `` Lane Agility Drill '' tests are the most sensitive in detecting positional differences.
