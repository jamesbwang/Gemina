 The genomes of the type strains of Roseivivax atlanticusand Roseivivax marinus ( Rhodobacteraceae , Alphaproteobacteria) , were analysed to determine their respective Average Nucleotide Identity ( ANI) and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization ( DDH) values. These species were proposed and effectively published relatively closely in time ( February and August 2014 , respectively) and so not taking account of the other. The intergenomic relatedness between both type strains , 97.0-97.4 % ANI and 82.8 % in silico DDH , confirm that they represent members of the same genomic species. This conclusion is also supported at the phenotypic level. Since the nameRoseovarius marinuswas validly published earlier , R. atlanticus ( Validation List 161 , IJSEM 65 , 1-4. 2015) should be considered a later heterotypic synonym of R. marinus ( Dai , Shi , Gao , Liu and Zhang , 2014) , in application of the priority rule.
