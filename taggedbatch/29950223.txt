 To investigate the diagnostic value of insulin like growth factor I ( IGF-I) , β2-microglobulin ( β2MG) and serum ferritin ( SF) in patients with multiple myeloma ( MM) and their ralationship with clinical staging. Seventy-seven patients with MM treated in Depertment of Hematology of Shanghai 10th hospital and Oncology of Shanghai Armed Police Hospital from August 2016 to June 2017 were enrolled in MM group , at same period 77 healthy volunteers were enrolled in normal control group. The diagnostic value of IGF-I , β2-MG and SF for MM , and their levels in different stages of MM were compared. The ROC analysis showed that β2-MG and SF alone as well as their combination had the diagnostic significance for MM , moreover the diagnostic value of IGF-I , β2-MG and SF combination was highest , but the single IGF-I did not possess diagnostic significance for MM. The comparison of IGF-I , β2-MG and SF levels in different stages of MM showed that the β2-MG and SF levels in I stage were higher than those in normal control group ( P < 0.05) , but lower than those in II and III stages ( P < 0.05). The IGF-I level in I stage was not statistically and significantly different from IGF-I level in normal control group ( P > 0.05) , but lower than those in II and III stage ( P < 0.05). The relationship analysis between IGF-I and β2-MG , SF in different stages showed that the IGF-I related with SF in I stage ( r = 0.417) , but did not relate with β2-MG; the IGF-I in II stage related with β2-MG and SF in II stage ( r = 0.543 , r = 0.426); IGF-I related with β2-MG and SF in III stage ( r = 0.425 and r = 0.672). The diagnostic value of IGF-I , β2-MG and SF alone does not high for MM , but their combination can significantly enhance the occurate rate of MM diagnosis. The levels of IGF-I , β2-MG and SF in II and III stages of MM all increase , moreover the level of IGF-I correlates with the levels of β2-MG and SF.
