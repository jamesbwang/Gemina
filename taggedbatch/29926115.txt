 To examine the imaging characteristics of intramuscular myxomas ( IM) and myxoid liposarcomas ( MLS) on With IRB approval , our institutional imaging database was searched for pathologically proven IM and MLS evaluated by We found eight patients ( 2 M , 6 F) with IM ( mean age 65.6 ± 10.4 years) and 16 patients ( 7 F , 9 M) with MLS ( mean age 42.8 ± 16.3 years). MRI was available in 7/8 IM and 15/16 MLS patients. There was no significant difference between the two groups in SUVmax ( IM 2.7 ± 0.8 , MLS 3.0 ± 1.0; p = 0.35) , SUVmean ( 1.7 ± 0.4 , 1.5 ± 0.5; p = 0.40) , total lesion<symptom> glycolysis ( 101.8 ± 127.3 , 2420.2 ± 4003.3 cm IM and MLS most commonly demonstrate low-grade FDG activity and overlapping metabolic measures on PET/CT. MRI is useful in differentiation , but MLS can present without macroscopic fat on MRI , underscoring the importance of radiologic-pathologic correlation for accurate diagnosis.
