 In this study , we present an advanced nanofabrication approach , so-called ` heterogeneous pulse anodization ' ( HPA) , in which galvanostatic stepwise and apodized sinusoidal pulse anodizations are combined in a single process. This novel anodization method enables the precise optical engineering of the characteristic photonic stopbands ( PSBs) of nanoporous anodic alumina photonic crystals ( NAA-PCs). The resulting structures are hybrid PCs ( Hy-NAA-PCs) composed of distributed Bragg reflectors ( DBRs) and apodized gradient-index filters ( APO-GIFs) embedded within the same PC structure. The modification of various anodization parameters such as anodization period , relative and total anodization time , structural arrangement of PCs within Hy-NAA-PCs , and pore widening time allows the fine-tuning of the PSBs ' features ( i.e. number , position and bandwidth of central wavelength) across the spectral regions. The effects of these fabrication parameters are systematically assessed , revealing that the positions of the characteristic transmission bands of Hy-NAA-PCs are highly controllable. Our study provides a comprehensive rationale towards the development of unique Hy-NAA-PCs with controllable optical properties , which could open new opportunities for a plethora of applications.
