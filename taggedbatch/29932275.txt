 What is the central question of this study? Can low-volume high-intensity interval training and continuous moderate-intensity exercise modulate oscillatory and retrograde shear , blood flow and flow-mediated arterial dilatation in patients with type 2 diabetes? What is the main finding and its importance? Low-volume high-intensity interval training , by increasing anterograde shear and decreasing retrograde shear and oscillatory index , can increase nitric oxide production and consequently result in increased flow-mediated dilatation and outward arterial remodelling in patients with type 2 diabetes. Atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes is characterized by endothelial dysfunction associated with impaired flow-mediated dilatation ( FMD) and increases retrograde and oscillatory shear. The present study investigated endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and shear rate in patients with type 2 diabetes at baseline and follow-up after 12 weeks of low-volume high-intensity interval training ( LV-HIIT) or continuous moderate-intensity training ( CMIT). Seventy-five sedentary patients with type 2 diabetes and untreated pre- or stage I hypertension were randomly divided into LV-HIIT , CMIT and control groups. The LV-HIIT group intervention was 12 intervals of 1.5 min at 85-90 % maximal heart rate ( HR
