 Coronary stent designs have been through extensive developments in the past few decades. Since the introduction of the self-apposing STENTYS stent , several theoretical advantages of its nitinol platform have been clinically evaluated. This paper reviews the current status , ongoing work , and future directions of this device. Areas covered: The OPEN ( STENTYS Coronary Bifurcation Stent System fOr the PErcutaNeous treatment of de novo lesions<symptom> in native bifurcated coronary arteries) trials revealed high technical success rates of the STENTYS performance in bifurcation lesions<symptom>. The Assessment of the Safety and Performance of the STENTYS self-expanding Coronary Stent in Acute Myocardial Infarction ( APPOSITION) trials demonstrated the safety and feasibility of the device in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Optical coherence tomography showed better short-term strut apposition in patients treated with the STENTYS stent in APPOSITION IV. The clinical outcomes of the device in saphenous vein graft lesions<symptom> and left main coronary artery disease are favorable. Expert commentary: Despite numerous theoretical advantages of the nitinol platform , superiority of the STENTYS self-apposing stent over currently available drug-eluting stents has not yet been proven. However , the ongoing registries evaluating the performance of the STENTYS Xposition will provide more insights in its clinical performance.
