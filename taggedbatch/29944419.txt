 Patients with schizophrenia have higher rates of adverse childhood experiences ( ACEs) than the general population , and those who suffered multiple traumatic experiences have a higher prevalence of positive symptoms , poorer social functioning and more suicidal ideations and behavior. The current study aims to determine the prevalence of ACEs in a female patient sample with schizophrenia. An observational descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted. Participants included 50 female patients older than 18 years , with schizophrenia. Semi-structured interviews and the Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire were conducted. We observed that 90 % experienced at least one ACE. Most ( 52 %) suffered 4 or more ACEs. A high prevalence of emotional abuse and neglect was found and a significant relationship between patients who suffered multiple ACEs and the presence of suicidal behavior and persistent auditory hallucinations.
