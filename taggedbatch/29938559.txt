 To investigate the association of Mediterranean food group consumption with successful aging ( SA) , among people more than 50 years old. Dietary habits , as well as several bio-clinical characteristics of the Greek participants enrolled in the ATTICA ( n = 1,128 men and women from Athens metropolitan area) and the MEDIS ( n = 2,221 men and women from selected Greek islands) cohort studies were investigated in relation to SA; SA was measured using a validated 10-scale index. Multivariate discriminant food group analysis revealed that legumes consumption , followed by vegetables , cereals , and poultry were associated with higher levels of SA index ( explained variability: 7.9 %) , mainly among islanders , but not among mainland participants. Further analysis revealed that alcohol consumption was positively associated with SA for mainlanders ( ATTICA study) but inversely for islanders ( MEDIS study; all p 's < .05). The differential and hierarchical effect of various foods on SA and the diet-environmental interaction revealed in the present work may help health professionals to better understand the role of diet on SA , and to prioritize the nutritional needs of older people for better quality of life.
