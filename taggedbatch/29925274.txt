 To investigate associations between cardiovascular disease risk factors , including fasting glucose , cholesterol , high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-c) , LDL-c , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , body mass index ( BMI) , C-peptide , creatinine kinase , smoking , alcohol use , physical activity , C-reactive protein as well as homocysteine levels and cardiovascular events. Data from 1545 men aged ≥ 40 years , with testosterone deficiency ( TD) ( < 300 ng/dL) and non-TD ( ≥ 300 ng/dL) which were extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database 2011-2012 and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed positive associations between TD and BMI ( ≥ 35 vs. < 18.5: OR = 2.51 , 95 % CI: 1.19-5.32 , p = .016) , HDL-c ( < 0.91 vs. ≥ 0.91: OR = 1.60 , 95 % CI: 1.14-2.24 , p = .006) and diabetes ( diabetes vs. non-diabetes: OR = 1.48 , 95 % CI: 1.14-1.92 , p = .004) as well as negative associations between TD and metabolic equivalent scores ( ≥ 12 vs. < 12: OR = 0.69 , 95 % CI: 0.52-0.91 , p = .009) and smoking ( Ever vs. never: OR = 0.69 , 95 % CI: 0.51-0.94 , p = .018). Furthermore , total serum testosterone levels were lower in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( p = .04) and angina/angina pectoris ( p = .001) compared with subjects without these cardiac problems. Low serum testosterone was associated with multiple risk factors for CHD.
