 Many eukaryotic transcription factors ( TFs) contain intrinsically disordered low-complexity sequence domains ( LCDs) , but how these LCDs drive transactivation remains unclear. We used live-cell single-molecule imaging to reveal that TF LCDs form local high-concentration interaction hubs at synthetic and endogenous genomic loci. TF LCD hubs stabilize DNA binding , recruit RNA polymerase II ( RNA Pol II) , and activate transcription. LCD-LCD interactions within hubs are highly dynamic , display selectivity with binding partners , and are differentially sensitive to disruption by hexanediols. Under physiological conditions , rapid and reversible LCD-LCD interactions occur between TFs and the RNA Pol II machinery without detectable phase separation. Our findings reveal fundamental mechanisms underpinning transcriptional control and suggest a framework for developing single-molecule imaging screens for drugs targeting gene regulatory interactions implicated in disease.
