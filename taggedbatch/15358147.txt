 While interleukin ( IL) -1 β is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in host defense , high levels can cause life-threatening sterile inflammation<symptom> including systemic inflammatory response syndrome<disease><symptom>. Hence , the control of IL-1β secretion is of outstanding biomedical importance. In response to a first inflammatory stimulus such as lipopolysaccharide , pro-IL-1β is synthesized as a cytoplasmic inactive pro-form. Extracellular ATP originating from injured cells is a prototypical second signal for inflammasome-dependent maturation and release of IL-1β. The human anti-protease alpha-1 antitrypsin ( AAT) and IL-1β regulate each other
