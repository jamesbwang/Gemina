 The functions of macrophages in healthy tissues extend beyond their well-established roles as immune sentinels and effectors. Among tissues , cells of the brain and heart possess unique excitatory properties that likely demand special support. Accordingly , existing evidence demonstrates that microglia in the brain has an active role in synaptic organization , control of neuronal excitability , phagocytic removal of debris , and trophic support during brain development. In the heart , recent studies suggest that cardiac macrophages are involved in the regulation of heart homeostasis by phagocytosis , production of trophic , and immune-related factors , and by forming direct contacts with cardiomyocytes to regulate electrical conduction. In this review , we discuss mechanisms associated with the high degree of specialization of resident macrophages in both tissues , their origin and heterogeneity , and their contributions in regulating homeostasis under steady-state and pathological conditions.
