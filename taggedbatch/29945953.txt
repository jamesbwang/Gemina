 Distinct subsets of resident tissue macrophages are important in hematopoietic stem cell niche homeostasis and erythropoiesis. We used a myeloid reporter gene ( Csf1r-eGFP) to dissect the persistence of bone<disease> marrow and splenic macrophage subsets following lethal irradiation and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a mouse model. Multiple recipient bone<disease> marrow and splenic macrophage subsets survived post-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with organ specific persistence kinetics. Short-term persistence ( 5 weeks) of recipient resident macrophages in spleen paralleled the duration of extra medullary hematopoiesis. In bone<disease> marrow , radiation-resistant recipient CD169
