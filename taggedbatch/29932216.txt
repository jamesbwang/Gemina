 Adipose tissue is a dynamic endocrine organ playing a pivotal role in metabolism modulation. Adipocytes differentiation requires a highly orchestrated series of changes of gene expression in precursor cells. At the same time , white mature adipocytes are plastic cells able to reversibly transdifferentiate toward fibroblast-like cells via the liposecretion process , returning back to a non-committed status of the cells. In particular , adipose tissue microenvironment along with external signaling molecules such as adipokines , cytokines and growth factors can regulate adipocytes physiology through complex molecular networks. MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) , a type of non-coding RNA , acting as fine regulators of biological processes and their expression is sensible to the environment and cellular status changes. MiRNAs are thought to play a pivotal role in regulating the physiology of adipose tissue as well as in the development of obesity and associated metabolic disturbances , although the underlying mechanisms have not been identified so far. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms orchestrating adipose tissue biology is required to better characterize obesity and its associated diseases. In this respect , the review aims to analyze the microRNAs potentially involved in adipogenesis highlighting their role in the process of liposecretion , adipocyte proliferation , and adipokines secretion. The role of microRNAs in the development of obesity and obesity-associated disorders is also discussed.
