 Staphylococcus<pathogen> argenteus , a novel species of the genus Staphylococcus<pathogen> or a member of the S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> complex , is closely related to S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and is usually misidentified. In this study , the presence of S. argenteus in isolated S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> was investigated in 67 rabbits with abscess<symptom> lesions<symptom> during 2014-2016. Among 19 S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> complex isolates , three were confirmed to be S. argenteus by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry , nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene amplification , and multilocus sequence type. All S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> complex isolates , including the S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> isolates , were examined for their antimicrobial resistance phenotype by disk diffusion and for their resistance genotype by PCR assays. Among the S. argenteus isolates , one was susceptible to all antimicrobial drugs and the other two were resistant to penicillin and doxycycline. In contrast , most S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> isolates were resistant to penicillin ( 37.5 %) , and gentamicin ( 12.5 %). Moreover , S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> isolates harbored the blaZ , mecA , aacA-aphD , and mrs ( A) as well as mutations of gyrA and grlA , but S. argenteus isolates carried solely the blaZ. S. argenteus isolates were investigated for enterotoxin ( sea-sed) and virulence genes by PCR. One isolate carried sea , sec , and sed , whereas the other two isolates carried only sea or sed. No isolate carried seb and see. All three S. argenteus isolates carried hla , hlb , and clfA , followed by pvl , whereas coa , spa ( IgG-binding region) , and spa ( x region) were not detected in the three isolates. This paper presents the first identification of S. argenteus from rabbits in Thailand. S. argenteus might be pathogenic because the isolates carried virulence genes. Moreover , antimicrobial resistance was observed. Investigations of this new bacterial species should be conducted in other animal species as well as in humans.
