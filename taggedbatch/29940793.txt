 Histone posttranslational modifications ( PTMs) help regulate DNA templated processes; however , relatively little work has unbiasedly explored the single-molecule combinations of histone PTMs , their dynamics on short timescales , or how these preexisting histone PTMs modulate further histone modifying enzyme activity. We use quantitative top down proteomics to unbiasedly measure histone H4 proteoforms ( single-molecule combinations of PTMs) upon butyrate treatment. Our results show that histone proteoforms change in cells within 10 minutes of application of sodium butyrate. Cells recover from treatment within 30 minutes after removal of butyrate. Surprisingly , K20me2 containing proteoforms are the near-exclusive substrate of histone acetyltransferases upon butyrate treatment. Single-molecule hierarchies of progressive PTMs mostly dictate the addition and removal of histone PTMs ( K16ac > K12ac â‰¥ K8ac > K5ac , and the reverse on recovery). This reveals the underlying single-molecule mechanism that explains the previously reported but indistinct and unexplained patterns of H4 acetylation. Thus , preexisting histone PTMs strongly modulate histone modifying enzyme activity and this suggests that proteoform constrained reaction pathways are crucial mechanisms that enable the long-term stability of the cellular epigenetic state.
