 A high-throughput method combining liquid handling system and 96-well microplate pipetting format was developed for total sugar determination. With this new method , we characterized diverse sugar accumulation in sorghum varieties. Sweet sorghum accumulates large amounts of sucrose in its stalk and , therefore , has emerged as one important bioenergy crop. The commonly used sugar measurement , Brix , limits the characterization of internode variation of the sugar concentrations due to its low throughput. Here we developed a low-cost , high-throughput method to determine profiles of total sugars in sorghum internodes with a liquid handling system-based sample preparation and a phenol-sulfuric acid assay in 96-well microplate format. The present method generates results highly correlated with commonly used Brix measurements ( r = 0.922). The inter-assay coefficient of variation ranged from 4.8 to 7.6 %. The present method can reliably estimate mixed sugars composed of 80 % sucrose. We characterized the profiles of 35 sorghum accessions and identified 21 accessions with significantly different sugar concentrations between internodes either due to dried-up internodes or concentration differences. As a high-throughput alternative to Brix measurements , the new method makes it possible to phenotype total sugars from large numbers of internode samples and , therefore , will be useful for genetic and breeding purposes.
