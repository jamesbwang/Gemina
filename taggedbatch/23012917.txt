 Over the last two decades , several conservative femoral prostheses have been designed. The goals of conservative stems include: the spearing of the trochanteric bone stock; a more physiological loading in the proximal femur reducing the risk of stress shielding; and to avoid a long stem into the diaphysis preventing impingement with the femoral cortex and thigh pain.All stems designed to be less invasive than conventional uncemented stems are commonly named ` short stems '. However , this term is misleading because it refers to a heterogeneous group of stems deeply different in terms of design , biomechanics and bearing. In the short-term follow-up , all conservative stems provided excellent survivorship. However , variable rates of complications were reported , including stem malalignment , incorrect stem sizing and intra-operative fracture.Radiostereometric analysis ( RSA<pathogen>) studies demonstrated that some conservative stems were affected by an early slight migration and rotation within the first months after surgery , followed by a secondary stable fixation. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA) studies demonstrated an implant-specific pattern of bone remodelling.Although the vast majority of stems demonstrated a good osseointegration , some prostheses transferred loads particularly to the lateral and distal-medial regions , favouring proximal stress shielding and bone atrophy in the great trochanter and calcar regions.
