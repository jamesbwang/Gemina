 Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM) represents 5-10 % of diabetes cases worldwide. The incidence of T1DM is increasing , and there is no immediate prospect of a cure. As such , lifelong management is required , the burden of which is being eased by novel treatment modalities , particularly from the field of diabetes technologies. Continuous glucose monitoring has become the standard of care and includes factory-calibrated subcutaneous glucose monitoring and long-term implantable glucose sensing. In addition , considerable progress has been made in technology-enabled glucose-responsive insulin delivery. The first hybrid insulin-only closed-loop system has been commercialized , and other closed-loop systems are under development , including dual-hormone glucose control systems. This Review focuses on well-established diabetes technologies , including glucose sensing , pen-based insulin delivery , data management and data analytics. We also cover insulin pump therapy , threshold-based suspend , predictive low-glucose suspend and single-hormone and dual-hormone closed-loop systems. Clinical practice recommendations for insulin pump therapy and continuous glucose monitoring are presented , and ongoing research and future prospects are highlighted. We conclude that the management of T1DM is improved by diabetes technology for the benefit of the majority of people with T1DM , their caregivers and guardians and health-care professionals treating patients with T1DM.
