 The AI-300 automated infusion device ( Sumitomo Heavy Industries , Ltd. , Tokyo , Japan) is subject to administration error as a function of smaller volumes of We determined administration accuracy between the improved and previous disposable kits by measuring variations in dispensed volumes and radioactive concentrations of The values obtained using the previous kit deviated from the reference values by a maximum of -10.6 % , and the deviation depended on dispensed volumes of The administration accuracy of the AI-300 using the previous kit varied considerably according to smaller dispensed volumes , but the improved kit might alleviate this problem. The present results indicated that the improved disposal kit should be immediately implemented to eliminate uncertainty surrounding quantitative PET findings.
