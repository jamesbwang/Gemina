 Transforming growth factor β ( TGF-β) , retinoic acid ( RA) , p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) , and MEK signaling play critical roles in cell differentiation , proliferation , and apoptosis. We investigated the effect of RA and the role of these signaling molecules on the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 ( p-Smad2/ 3) induced by TGF-β1. A549 epithelial cells and CCD-11Lu fibroblasts were incubated and stimulated with or without all-trans RA ( ATRA) and TGF-β1 and with MAPK or MEK inhibitors. The levels of p-Smad2/ 3 were analyzed by western blotting. For animal models , we studied three experimental mouse groups: control , bleomycin , and bleomycin + ATRA group. Changes in histopathology , lung injury score , and levels of TGF-β1 and Smad3 were evaluated at 1 and 3 weeks. When A549 cells were pre-stimulated with TGF-β1 prior to RA treatment , RA completely inhibited the p-Smad2/ 3. However , when A549 cells were pre-treated with RA prior to TGF-β1 stimulation , RA did not completely suppress the p-Smad2/ 3. When A549 cells were pre-treated with MAPK inhibitor , TGF-β1 failed to phosphorylate Smad2/3. In fibroblasts , p38 MAPK inhibitor suppressed TGF-β1-induced p-Smad2. In a bleomycin-induced lung injury mouse model , RA decreased the expression of TGF-β1 and Smad3 at 1 and 3 weeks. RA had inhibitory effects on the phosphorylation of Smad induced by TGF-β1 in vitro , and RA also decreased the expression of TGF-β1 at 1 and 3 weeks in vivo. Furthermore , pre-treatment with a MAPK inhibitor showed a preventative effect on TGF-β1/ Smad phosphorylation in epithelial cells. As a result , a combination of RA and MAPK inhibitors may suppress the TGF-β1-induced lung injury and fibrosis<disease>.
