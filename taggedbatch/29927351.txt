 In our proteome-wide screen ( Muir et al. 2014 Elife) , Ysp2 ( also known as Lam2/Ltc4) was identified as a likely physiologically relevant target of TORC2-dependent protein kinase Ypk1 in the yeast Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen>. Ysp2 was subsequently shown to be one of a new family of sterol-binding proteins located at plasma membrane ( PM)- endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) contact sites ( Gatta et al. 2015 Elife). Here we document that Ysp2 and its paralog Lam4/Ltc3 are authentic Ypk1 substrates in vivo and show using genetic and biochemical criteria that Ypk1-mediated phosphorylation inhibits the ability of these proteins to promote retrograde transport of sterols from the PM to the ER. Furthermore , we provide evidence that a change in PM sterol homeostasis promotes cell survival under membrane-perturbing conditions known to activate TORC2-Ypk1 signaling. These observations define the underlying molecular basis of a new regulatory mechanism for cellular response to plasma membrane stress.
