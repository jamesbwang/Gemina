 Skin wound<disease><symptom> healing includes a system of biological processes , collectively restoring the integrity of the skin after injury. Healing by second intention refers to repair of large and deep wounds<disease><symptom> where the tissue edges can not be approximated and substantial scarring is often observed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) in second intention healing using a surgical wound<disease><symptom> model in sheep. MSCs are known to contribute to the inflammatory , proliferative , and remodeling phases of the skin regeneration process in rodent models , but data are lacking for large animal models. This study used three different approaches ( clinical , histopathological , and molecular analysis) to assess the putative action of allogeneic MSCs at 15 and 42 days after lesion<symptom> creation. At 15 days post-lesion , the wounds<disease><symptom> treated with MSCs showed a higher degree of wound<disease><symptom> closure , a higher percentage of re-epithelialization , proliferation , neovascularization and increased contraction in comparison to a control group. At 42 days , the wounds<disease><symptom> treated with MSCs had more mature and denser cutaneous adnexa compared to the control group. The MSCs-treated group showed an absence of inflammation<symptom> and expression of CD3 + and CD20 +. Moreover , the mRNA expression of hair-keratine ( hKER) was observed in the MSCs-treated group 15 days after wound<disease><symptom> creation and had increased significantly by 42 days post-wound creation. Collagen1 gene ( Col1Î±1) expression was also greater in the MSCs-treated group compared to the control group at both days 15 and 42. Peripheral blood-derived MSCs may improve the quality of wound<disease><symptom> healing both for superficial injuries and deep lesions<symptom>. MSCs did not induce an inflammatory response and accelerated the appearance of granulation tissue , neovascularization , structural proteins , and skin adnexa.
