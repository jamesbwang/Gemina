 A woman in her 70 's with a background of ocular malignant melanoma treated more than a decade ago was admitted to hospital with symptoms of dysphagia<symptom> and exertional shortness of breath. Routine ECG showed a grossly abnormal ECG with T wave inversion in inferolateral leads and some anterior leads. Consequently , echocardiography and CT demonstrated the presence of a large pericardial tumour which on biopsy was found to be metastatic melanoma. Patient was treated with palliative radiotherapy with only temporary initial benefit.
