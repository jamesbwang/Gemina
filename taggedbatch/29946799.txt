 The BURDEN IBS-C study was conducted to better understand the experiences , attitudes , and unmet needs of sufferers of irritable bowel syndrome<disease><symptom> with constipation<symptom> ( IBS-C) in comparison to the perceptions and challenges of healthcare providers ( HCPs) who treat IBS-C patients. This was an author-developed , online questionnaire using KnowledgePanel Most patients had used ( 86 %) and/or were using ( 76 %) over-the-counter treatments for their IBS-C , with 12 % currently on prescription therapy. At the time this study was conducted , 66 % and 63 % were not satisfied/completely satisfied with over-the-counter or prescription treatment , respectively , citing inadequate efficacy ( 55 %) and side effects ( 39 %) , most commonly diarrhea<disease><symptom> , as common reasons for dissatisfaction. IBS-C respondents most commonly reported feeling frustrated ( 43 %) and stressed ( 28 %) regarding IBS-C , though 39 % were accepting of IBS-C as part of daily life. HCPs were aligned with patients in thinking that patients were frustrated ( 76 %) and stressed ( 65 %) but HCPs were less likely to recognize that patients had become accepting of their IBS-C ( 13 %). Most HCPs ( 79 %) were not satisfied/completely satisfied with the prescription treatments available at the time this study was conducted. Inadequate response rates to current therapies ( 55 %) and treatment adherence/compliance issues ( 58 %) were the most frequent challenges encountered by HCPs. IBS-C respondents reported that their symptoms impacted productivity and personal activity , on average , 4 and 3 days/month , respectively. These results suggest that current management pathways may not be adequately addressing the symptoms and needs of individuals with IBS-C , most notably side effects and lack of efficacy. Patients and HCPs expressed dissatisfaction with over-the-counter and prescription treatments available at the time this study was conducted. Additional treatment options and improved dialogue would be beneficial to HCPs and patients. Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc..
