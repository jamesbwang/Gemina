 Many of the comorbidities of obesity , including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases , are related to the low-grade chronic inflammation<symptom> of white adipose tissue. Under white adipocyte stress , local infiltration of immune cells and enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines together reduce metabolic flexibility and lead to insulin resistance in obesity. Whereas white adipocytes act in energy storage , brown and beige adipocytes specialize in energy expenditure. Brown and beige activity protects against obesity and associated metabolic disorders , such as hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia. Compared to white fat , brown adipose tissue depots are less susceptible to developing local inflammation<symptom> in response to obesity; however , strong obesogenic insults ultimately induce a locally pro-inflammatory environment in brown fat. This condition directly alters the thermogenic activity of brown fat by impairing its energy expenditure mechanism and uptake of glucose for use as a fuel substrate. Pro-inflammatory cytokines also impair beige adipogenesis , which occurs mainly in subcutaneous adipose tissue. There is evidence that inflammatory processes occurring in perivascular adipose tissues alter their brown-versus-white plasticity , impair the extent of browning in these depots and favour the local release of vasculature damaging signals. In summary , the targeting of brown and beige adipose tissues by pro-inflammatory signals and the subsequent impairment of their thermogenic and metabolite draining activities appears to represent obesity-driven disturbances that contribute to metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom> and cardiovascular alterations in obesity.
