 Two new abietane diterpenes , huperphlegmarin A-B ( 1-2) , were isolated from the aerial parts of Huperzia phlegmaria ( L.) Rothm. ( Lycopodiaceae) , in addition to five known compounds including lycoxanthol ( 3) , 21β-hydroxyserrat-14-en-3β-yl acetate ( 4) , 21α-hydroxyserrat-14-en-3β-yl acetate ( 5) , 21α-hydroxyserrat-14-en-3β-ol ( 6) , and fawcettidine ( 7). Their structures were determined by the combination analyses of spectroscopy , including 1D- , 2D-NMR , HRESIMS , CD and comparison with the reported data in the literature. Huperphlegmarin B ( 2) presented the rare 1,11-epoxy group in the molecule. Compounds 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 were performed for AChE inhibitory activity and compound 3 showed the inhibitory activity against AChE with IC
