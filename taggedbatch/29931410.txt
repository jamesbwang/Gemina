 B-mode ultrasound ( B-US) and strain elastography ultrasound ( SE-US) images have a potential to distinguish thyroid tumor with different lymph node ( LN) status. The purpose of our study is to investigate whether the application of multi-modality images including B-US and SE-US can improve the discriminability of thyroid tumor with LN metastasis based on a radiomics approach. Ultrasound ( US) images including B-US and SE-US images of 75 papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC) cases were retrospectively collected. A radiomics approach was developed in this study to estimate LNs status of PTC patients. The approach included image segmentation , quantitative feature extraction , feature selection and classification. Three feature sets were extracted from B-US , SE-US , and multi-modality containing B-US and SE-US. They were used to evaluate the contribution of different modalities. A total of 684 radiomics features have been extracted in our study. We used sparse representation coefficient-based feature selection method with 10-bootstrap to reduce the dimension of feature sets. Support vector machine with leave-one-out cross-validation was used to build the model for estimating LN status. Using features extracted from both B-US and SE-US , the radiomics-based model produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC) ( Formula: see text) 0.90 , accuracy ( ACC) ( Formula: see text) 0.85 , sensitivity ( SENS) ( Formula: see text) 0.77 and specificity ( SPEC) ( Formula: see text) 0.88 , which was better than using features extracted from B-US or SE-US separately. Multi-modality images provided more information in radiomics study. Combining use of B-US and SE-US could improve the LN metastasis estimation accuracy for PTC patients.
