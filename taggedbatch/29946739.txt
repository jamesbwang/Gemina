 Three strains of symbiotic bacteria were isolated from an entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema poinari retrieved from soil in eastern Poland. Using 16S rDNA , recA , gltX , gyrB , and dnaN gene sequences for phylogenetic analysis , these strains were shown to belong to the species Xenorhabdus bovienii. The nucleotide identity between the studied S. poinari microsymbionts and other X. bovienii strains calculated for 16S rDNA and concatenated sequences of four protein-coding genes was 98.7-100 % and 97.9-99.5 % , respectively. The phenotypic properties of the isolates also supported their close phylogenetic relationship with X. bovienii. All three tested X. bovienii strains of different Steinernema clade origin supported the recovery of infective juveniles and subsequent development of the nematode population. However , the colonization degree of new infective juvenile generations was significantly affected by the bacterial host donor/recipient. The colonization degree of infective juveniles reared on bacterial symbionts deriving from a non-cognate clade of nematodes was extremely low , but proved the possible host-switching between non-related Steinernema species.
