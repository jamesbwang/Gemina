 In this study , the adsorption behavior of different metal centers in analogous M-1,4-NDC frameworks towards guest molecules through simulation studies and experimental studies were conducted. Simulation studies showed that adsorption behavior of analogous M-1,4-NDC is affected by the atomic radius of metal centers , which were found in agreement with the experimental studies.
