 The phase-II modafinil in debilitating fatigue<symptom> after stroke trial demonstrated that modafinil improves fatigue<symptom> and quality of life in severely fatigued stroke survivors. For this study , we sought to examine the interaction between fatigue<symptom> and quality of life after stroke and determine whether reducing fatigue<symptom> resulted in improved quality of life. In addition , we followed up a subset of patients 12-months after the trial to assess the long-term outcomes of modafinil therapy. We used linear regression to analyze interaction between baseline fatigue<symptom> , as measured by the multidimensional fatigue<symptom> inventory ( MFI) , and quality of life , as measured by the stroke-specific quality of life scale ( SSQoL); and between changes in MFI and SSQoL during treatment. Patients also took part in semi-structured interviews and study assessments 12-months after trial completion to assess long-term patterns of modafinil use , safety and efficacy. MFI and SSQoL were significantly correlated at baseline ( Î² = -1.975 95 % CI -3.082 , -0.869 , Modafinil appears to be safe and , for at least some patients , effective long-term in fatigued stroke survivors. Alleviating fatigue<symptom> has a significant relationship with improved quality of life. https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=368268 , unique-identifier: ACTRN12615000350527.
