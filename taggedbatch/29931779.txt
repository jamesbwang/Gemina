 Khat ( Catha edulis) is a stimulant plant widely used in East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Tobacco is often co-used with khat and its use has expanded to other parts of the world. Chronic khat use is associated with negative health consequences. There is a lack of research to develop a tool to assess attitudes toward khat use. This study aimed to develop a brief tool to assess attitude and perception related to khat ( i.e. the Khat Knowledge , Attitudes and Perception Scale). Four-hundred and three participants in Yemen ( 151 concurrent users of khat and tobacco , 141 khat-only users and 92 non-users of khat and tobacco) were asked about knowledge and attitudes related to khat. A principle component analysis with Promax rotation , Scree-plot and Cronbach 's Î± coefficients was performed to examine psychometric properties of the Khat Knowledge , Attitudes and Perception Scale. Principle component analysis revealed five factors: negative beliefs , positive beliefs , idleness , weight control and family issues. Internal consistency of items in negative beliefs , positive beliefs , idleness , weight control and family issues were 0.88 , 0.62 , 0.62 , 0.72 and 0.53 , respectively. Greater negative beliefs was inversely correlated with positive beliefs but positively associated with idleness , weight control and family issues. Concurrent users and khat-only users had lower scores on negative beliefs than non-users. Concurrent users had higher scores on positive beliefs than khat-only and non-users. These results provide initial support of the usefulness of the Khat Knowledge , Attitudes and Perception Scale.
