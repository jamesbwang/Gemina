 Carbostyrils are among the most widely used sensitising antennae for luminescent lanthanides; they afford bright complexes with Eu and Tb , and can also sensitise the emissions of the less commonly used Sm , Dy , Yb and Nd. Systematic studies on the effect of structural variations on the photophysical properties and lanthanide sensitising abilities of carbostyrils can therefore have a large impact. We replaced the secondary amide linker that connects the metal binding site to the antenna with a carboxymethyl-substituted tertiary amide. Eight Tb and Eu complexes were prepared. All had higher lanthanide luminescence quantum yields ( ΦLn) than their secondary amide analogues; three Tb emitters had ΦTb > 40 %. Eu complexes had ΦEu up to 11.6 %. The antenna singlet and triplet excited states are slightly shifted , while the metal coordination sphere is unchanged by the introduction of the carboxymethyl group.
