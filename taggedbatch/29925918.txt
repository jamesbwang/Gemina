 Aspirin can efficiently inhibit liver cancer growth , but the mechanism is poorly understood. In this study , we report that aspirin modulates glucose uptake through downregulating glucose transporter 1 ( GLUT1) , leading to the inhibition of hepatoma cell proliferation. Our data showed that aspirin significantly decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) and glucose consumption in hepatoma cells. Interestingly , we identified that GLUT1 and HIF1α could be decreased by aspirin. Mechanically , we demonstrated that the -1008/ -780 region was the regulatory element of transcriptional factor NF-κB in GLUT1 promoter by luciferase report gene assays. PDTC , an inhibitor of NF-κB , could suppress the expression of GLUT1 in HepG2 and H7402 cells , followed by affecting the levels of ROS and glucose consumption. CoCl
