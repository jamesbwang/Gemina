 In this paper , the plasma power density and corresponding plasma dose of a low-cost air non-thermal plasma jet ( ANPJ) device are estimated at different axial distances from the nozzle. This estimation is achieved by measuring the voltage and current at the substrate using diagnostic techniques that can be easily made in laboratory; thin wire and dielectric probe , respectively. This device uses a compressed air as input gas instead of the relatively-expensive , large-sized and heavy weighed tanks of Ar or He gases. The calculated plasma dose is found to be very low and allows the presented device to be used in biomedical applications ( especially blood coagulation). While plasma active species and charged-particles are found to be the most effective on blood coagulation formation , both air flow and UV , individually , do not have any effect. Moreover , optimal conditions for accelerating blood coagulation are studied. Results showed that , the power density at the substrate is shown to be decreased with increasing the distance from the nozzle. In addition , both distances from nozzle and air flow rate play an important role in accelerating blood coagulation process. Finally , this device is efficient , small-sized , safe enough , of low cost and , hence , has its chances to be wide spread as a first aid and in ambulance.
