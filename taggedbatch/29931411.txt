 Sickle cell disease ( SCD) complications mostly result from vascular dysfunction , concerning systemic microvasculature and cerebral large vessels. The aim of this cohort study was to identify potential circulating biomarkers predictive for further vascular event occurrence in pediatric SCD. We consecutively enrolled 108 children with SCD at steady state , aged 3-18 years old ( median 9.8 years). Hematology , coagulation , hemolysis<symptom> , endothelial , platelet and vascular activation parameters were recorded at inclusion. Neurovascular and systemic vascular events were prospectively recorded during a mean follow-up period of 27 months. Patients at steady state displayed significantly higher hemolysis<symptom> and platelet activation markers , higher leukocyte , CD34 + hematopoietic stem cell and microvesicle counts , and a pro-coagulant profile compared to controls matched for age and ethnicity. Circulating endothelial cell or nucleosome level did not differ. During the follow-up period , 36 patients had at least one neurovascular ( n = 12) or systemic vascular event ( n = 25). In a multivariate model , high CD34 + cell count was the best predictor for the occurrence of a vascular event ( OR 1.2 for 1000 cell/mL increase , 95 % CI ( 1.049-1.4) , p = 0.013 , sensitivity 53 % , specificity 84 % for a threshold of 8675 cells/mL). CD34 + cell count at steady state is a promising biomarker of further vascular event in children with SCD.
