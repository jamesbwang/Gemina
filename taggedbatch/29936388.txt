 Individuals involved in out-of-home care are at higher risk of death by suicide. We aimed to determine whether parents with two generations of involvement in out-of-home care ( themselves as children , and their own children) are at increased risk of death by suicide than parents with no involvement or parents with one generation of involvement in out-of-home care. This population-based cohort study included all individuals born in Sweden between 1973 and 1980 who had at least one child between 1990 and 2012 ( n = 487,948). Women ( n = 259,275) and men ( n = 228,673) were examined separately. When compared with mothers with no involvement in out-of-home care , mothers with two generations of involvement were at more than five times greater risk of death by suicide ( aHR = 5.52; 95 % CI 2.91-10.46); mothers with one generation of involvement were also at significantly higher risk of death by suicide ( mothers were in care as children: aHR = 2.35; 95 % CI 1.27-4.35; child was placed in care: aHR = 3.23; 95 % CI 1.79-5.83). Involvement in out-of-home care ( in either generation) did not affect risk of death by suicide for fathers. Reason for placement in out-of-home care is not known; these reasons could also be associated with risk of death by suicide Conclusion: Mothers with involvement in out-of-home care , either as children or when their child was placed in care , are at significantly higher risk of death by suicide. Mental health services should be provided to individuals involved in out-of-home care.
