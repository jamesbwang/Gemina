 Here we show that laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 ( LGP2) virus<pathogen> sensor protein regulates gene expression network of endogenous genes mediated by TAR-RNA binding protein ( TRBP)- bound microRNAs ( miRNAs). TRBP is an enhancer of RNA silencing , and functions to recruit precursor-miRNAs ( pre-miRNAs) to Dicer that processes pre-miRNA into mature miRNA. Viral<disease> infection<disease> activates the antiviral innate immune response in mammalian cells. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I ( RIG-I)- like receptors ( RLRs) , including RIG-I , melanoma-differentiation-associated gene 5 ( MDA5) , and LGP2 , function as cytoplasmic virus sensor proteins during viral<disease> infection<disease>. RIG-I and MDA5 can distinguish between different types of RNA viruses to produce antiviral cytokines , including type I interferon. However , the role of LGP2 is controversial. We found that LGP2 bound to the double-stranded RNA binding sites of TRBP , resulting in inhibition of pre-miRNA binding and recruitment by TRBP. Furthermore , although it is unclear whether TRBP binds to specific pre-miRNA , we found that TRBP bound to particular pre-miRNAs with common structural characteristics. Thus , LGP2 represses specific miRNA activities by interacting with TRBP , resulting in selective regulation of target genes. Our findings show that a novel function of LGP2 is to modulate RNA silencing , indicating the crosstalk between RNA silencing and RLR signaling in mammalian cells.
