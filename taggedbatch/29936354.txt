 A series of new N '- ( 2-alkylthio-4-chloro-5-methylbenzenesulfonyl) -1- ( 5-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl) amidine derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated in vitro by MTT assays for their antiproliferative activity against cell lines of colon cancer HCT-116 , cervical cancer HeLa and breast cancer MCF-7. The studied compounds display selective activity mainly against HCT-116 and HeLa cells. Thus , five compounds show selective cytotoxic effect against HCT-116 ( IC
