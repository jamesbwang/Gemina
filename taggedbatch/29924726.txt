 The genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana encodes three paralogues of the papain-like cysteine proteinase cathepsin B ( AtCathB1 , AtCathB2 and AtCathB3) , whose individual functions are still largely unknown. Here we show that a mutated splice site causes severe truncations of the AtCathB1 polypeptide , rendering it catalytically incompetent. By contrast , AtCathB2 and AtCathB3 are effective proteases which display comparable hydrolytic properties and share most of their substrate specificities. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that a single amino acid substitution ( Gly336 â†’ Glu) is sufficient to confer AtCathB2 with the capacity to tolerate arginine in its specificity-determining S2 subsite , which is otherwise a hallmark of AtCathB3-mediated cleavages. A degradomics approach utilizing proteome-derived peptide libraries revealed that both enzymes are capable of acting as endopeptidases and exopeptidases , releasing dipeptides from the C-termini of substrates. Mutation of the carboxydipeptidase determinant His207 also affected the activity of AtCathB2 towards non-exopeptidase substrates , highlighting mechanistic differences between plant and human cathepsin B. This was also noted in molecular modeling studies which indicate that the occluding loop defining the dual enzymatic character of cathepsin B does not obstruct the active-site cleft of AtCathB2 to the same extent as in its mammalian orthologues.
