 The Theory of Chemical Structure , first proposed independently by Friedrich August Kekul√© and Archibald Scott Couper in 1858 was elaborated into a much more useful tool for organic chemists by the Russian , Aleksandr Mikhailovich Butlerov , the Professor of Chemistry at Kazan University. During the tenure of Butlerov , and his mentors , Zinin and Klaus , Kazan became the pre-eminent school of chemistry in the Russian empire. Butlerov 's work firmly established structural theory , and Butlerov confirmed its predictive value by predicting the structures of alcohols and alkenes , and then completing their synthesis. Butlerov 's student ( and disciple) , Vladimir Vasil ` evich Markovnikov , took Butlerov 's work and extended it , exploring the mutual influence of atoms in a molecule on the properties of the compound. From this work , Markovnikov was able to formulate his empirical rule for addition to alkenes.
