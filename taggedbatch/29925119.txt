 This study focuses on the theory-practice transfer in the field of research on participation in working life ( LTA). The aim was to determine what expectations are prevalent on the part of service providers , how they access scientific knowledge , how the transfer into practice takes place and what research gaps exist. At the same time , representatives of the German Statutory Pension Insurance were asked about internal structures for identifying research topics and evaluating research results as well as for knowledge transfer. The aim of the article is to address the relationship between research and practice in the field of LTA and to create a sensitivity for this topic. The results of this study are based on a written survey of 28 Vocational Training Institutes ( BFW) of the Federal Association of Vocational Rehabilitation Centres ( BV BFW) and on three expert interviews with representatives of pension insurance companies ( federal and regional). The response rate of the BFW survey was approximately 54 % ( N = 15). For the evaluation of data primarily qualitative content analysis was applied , which included a step by step coding of the data. The results of the survey indicate a pronounced need for translation processes and a culture of cooperation between research and practice. At the same time , a tension between the preservation of the autonomy of research and an increasing transfer orientation became evident. In addition , a wide range of approaches for structuring possible transfer activities could be identified. In the area of research on services for participation in working life , the development of a strategy for research transfer represents a future task. It is necessary to explore new communication structures and participatory research formats in which research groups and sponsors as well as practitioners can jointly carry out research in this field.
