 The ability of a chiral molecule to be able to transform from one structure to another , whilst remembering its original molecular information by means of an appropriate transition state is an abstract notion that may very well play a key role in important synthetic processes , and has thus attracted a considerable amount of attention among the chemistry community. Here , we have highlighted this concept of `` memory of chirality '' ( MOC) and extended it beyond the case of a simple molecule to larger and more complex natural products. Updated approaches that have recently been elucidated to obtain these asymmetric natural products are described , some of which may , until now , have been overcomplicated or overlooked.
