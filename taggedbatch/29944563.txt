 The purpose of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of Nd: YAG laser photocoagulation in the treatment of vascular malformations in the oral and perioral area; 93 patients ( 104 lesions<symptom>) were evaluated in an Ambulatory of Oral Medicine ( 2006-2013). The sample consisted of 57 women ( 61 %) and 36 men ( 39 %) , aged 8 to 85 years. The lesion<symptom> size was smaller than 3 cm in most patients. The lesions<symptom> were located on the lips , jugal mucosa , tongue , palate , gingiva , and retromolar trigone. All patients were treated on an outpatient basis using local anesthesia and Nd: YAG laser ( Power Laser C) with a wavelength of 1064 nm and a fiber optic diameter of 400 Î¼m. After treatment no patients had complications , however , in patients of deep lesions<symptom> , 2 or more irradiations were required to treat the lesions<symptom>. Finally , the authors conclude that the clinical and aesthetic satisfactory results of the 93 patients treated with Nd: YAG laser suggest that this type of laser is effective and safe in the treatment of oral and perioral vascular malformations.
