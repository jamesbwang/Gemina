 Natural ecosystems near agricultural landscapes may provide rich environments for growing crops. However , the effect of a natural ecosystem on crop health and fruit quality is poorly understood. In the present study , it was investigated whether the presence of a natural ecosystem surrounding a crop area influences banana plant health and fruit postharvest behavior. Plants from two conventional banana crop areas with identical planting time and cultural practices were used; the only difference between banana crop areas is that one area was surrounded by a natural forest<disease> ( Atlantic forest<disease>) fragment ( Near-NF) , while the other area was inserted at the center of a conventional banana crop ( Distant-NF). Results showed that bananas harvested from Near-NF showed higher greenlife and a more homogeneous profile during ripening compared to fruits harvested from Distant-NF. Differences in quality parameters including greenlife , carbohydrate profile , and pulp firmness between fruits harvested from Near-NF and Distant-NF are explained , at least partly , by differences in the balance<symptom> of plant growth regulators ( indole-3-acetic acid and abscisic acid) in bananas during ripening. Furthermore , plants from Near-NF showed a lower severity index of black leaf streak disease ( BLSD) and higher levels of phenolic compounds in leaves compared to plants from Distant-NF. Together , the results provide additional evidence on how the maintenance of natural ecosystems near conventional crop areas could be a promising tool to improve plant health and fruit quality.
