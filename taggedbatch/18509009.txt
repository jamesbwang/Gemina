 Glucocorticoid production is regulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH) via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP)/ protein kinase A ( PKA) pathway in the adrenal cortex , but the changes in steroidogenesis associated with aging are unknown. In this study , we show that cell-autonomous steroidogenesis is induced by non-ACTH- mediated genotoxic stress in human adrenocortical H295R cells. Low-dose etoposide ( EP) was used to induce DNA damage as a genotoxic stress , leading to cellular senescence. We found that steroidogenesis was promoted in cells stained with Î³H2AX , a marker of DNA damaged cells. Among stress-associated and p53-inducible genes , the expression of GADD45A and steroidogenesis-related genes was significantly upregulated. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that GADD45A accumulated in the nuclei. Metabolite assay using cultured media showed that EP-treated cells were induced to produce and secrete considerable amounts of glucocorticoid. Knockdown of GADD45A using small interfering RNA markedly inhibited the EP-induced upregulation of steroidogenesis-related gene expression , and glucocorticoid production. A p38MAPK inhibitor , but not a PKA inhibitor , suppressed EP-stimulated steroidogenesis. These results suggest that DNA damage itself promotes steroidogenesis via one or more unprecedented non-ACTH-mediated pathway. Specifically , GADD45A plays a crucial role in the steroidogenic processes triggered by EP-stimulated genotoxic stress. Our study sheds new light on an alternate mechanism of steroidogenesis in the adrenal cortex.
