 The Zero-Heat-Flux technology of the SpotOn ® sensor to measure core temperature has been validated in vascular and cardiac surgery. Our aim was to assess its validity in gynecological surgery in terms of time of measurement , thermic status ( hypo- , normo- , or hyperthermia<symptom>) and the use of different warming devices. Prospective study in patients scheduled for major gynecological surgery using 3 warming systems ( Snuggle Warm ® , Lithotomy Underbody Blanket ® and Warmtac Pad ®). Intraoperative temperature was simultaneously monitored using the SpotOn ® sensor and a Dräger ® esophageal probe; measurements were taken after induction ( T0) , between 0 and 60 min ( T1) , between 60 and 120 min ( T2) and after 120 min ( T3). We calculated the level of correlation between pairs of measurements both overall and in subgroups with an acceptable difference of less than 0.5 oC. We built Bland-Altman plots , and calculated the Pearson correlation ( PC) and intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC) to test our data. We recruited 70 patients and included 66 for analysis , giving a total of 401 paired measurements. Overall , the PC and ICC for paired temperature readings were 0.82 and 0.90 , respectively. The lowest levels of correlation were observed after intubation , when a convective blanket was placed under the patient , and in hypothermic patients. The highest correlations were observed at T2 , and in normothermic patients. We found a high overall correlation between the SpotOn ® and the esophageal probe , with negligible differences and almost perfect agreement. The warming system used , time of measurement , and thermic status appear to influence the level of correlation , but these differences were not clinically significant.
