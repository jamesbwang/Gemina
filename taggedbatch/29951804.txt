 Takotsubo syndrome<disease><symptom> ( TS) usually involves ECG changes mimicking acute myocardial infarction ( AMI). The differentiation of both disorders is crucial for selection of appropriate treatment. The aim of this study was to assess ECG parameters in patients with TS and AMI , and try to establish a scoring tool for TS prediction. The study consisted of two study parts: evaluation and validation cohorts. Overall , the study included 82 patients with TS and 141 subjects with AMI. In addition to the major demographic characteristics and comorbidities , the following ECG parameters were analyzed: heart rate , QRS duration , QTc , QRS amplitudes in frontal and precordial leads , frequencies for ST-segment elevation , combined sign of positive ST-segment elevation in- aVR and absent in V TS was frequently diagnosed in women and in elderly patients. Presence of ST-segment elevation , inverted/biphasic T-waves in V The developed ECG-based TS-score model may be a useful complimentary tool for TS prediction in acute clinical setting.
