 Compared to the many studies that focus on the development of novel molecular frameworks pertaining to functionalized fluorescent materials , there is lesser emphasis on side chains even though they have a significant impact on the properties and applications of fluorescent materials. In this study , a series of pyridinium-functionalized tetraphenylethene salts ( TPEPy-1 to TPEPy-4) possessing different alkyl chains are synthesized , and the influence of chain length on their optical performance and applications is thoroughly investigated. By changing the alkyl chain , the fluorogens exhibit opposite emission behavior in aqueous media because of their distinct hydrophobic nature , and their solid-state emission can be fine-tuned from green to red owing to their distinct molecular configuration. In addition , by increasing the chain length , the microstructure of the self-assembled fluorogens converts from microplates to microrods with various emission colors. Moreover , TPEPy-1 exhibits dual-mode fluorescence `` turn-on '' response toward NO
