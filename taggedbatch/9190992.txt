 Supra-clavicular lymph node metastasis from ovarian cancer is rare. The present study reports the unique case of a 43-years-old patient who initially presented with left supra-clavicular lymph node metastasis , and was nulliparous. According to fine-needle aspiration cytology of the metastatic left supra-clavicular lymph nodes and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT) scan , the patient was diagnosed with poorly differentiated serous carcinoma of ovarian cancer , stage IV. Following two cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy , PET/CT showed that the patient had achieved a complete response. Next , cytoreductive surgery was performed and the postoperative histological findings showed that the patient had achieved a complete pathological response. According to NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology , the patient was stage IV and four cycles of chemotherapy were provided , with no recurrence observed during 3 years of follow-up. This case indicates that patients who initially present with distant metastatic lymph nodes and are nulliparous might have a better prognosis and avoid overtreatment.
