 Standardised interfaces for efficiently accessing high-throughput sequencing data are a fundamental requirement for large-scale genomic data sharing. We have developed htsget , a protocol for secure , efficient and reliable access to sequencing read and variation data. We demonstrate four independent client and server implementations , and the results of a comprehensive interoperability demonstration. http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/htsget.html. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
