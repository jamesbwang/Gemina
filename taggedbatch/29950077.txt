 The present research aimed to establish an associated two-dimensional fingerprint of Huanglian between characteristic chemical composition and antioxidant activity , which was applied to on-line screen the active constituents. In this study , the HPLC-ABTS-DAD-Q-TOF/ MS method , which can simultaneously identify individual components and rapidly screen for antioxidant compounds , was used to screen and identify antioxidant components in Huanglian. Fourteen compositions were discovered , and eight of them displayed antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity of different ingredients was evaluated by antioxidant efficiency. The data showed that 2 , 3 , 4-trihydroxy phenylpropionic acid , chlorogenic acid , ferulic acid , cularine , 3-O-feruloylquinic acid and feruloyltyramine showed stronger antioxidant activity than that of alkaloids. These experimental data can provide data support for the basic research of the antioxidant ingredients of Huanglian.
