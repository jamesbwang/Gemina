 Free-hand technique is widely used in pedicle screw placement for lumbar spine and generally safe; however , screw malposition still occurs. To develop a novel multi-level drill guide template for pedicle screw placement in lumbar spine and evaluate its accuracy. Twelve lumbar cadaveric specimens were randomly allocated into guide template group ( n = 6) and free-hand group ( n = 6). Computed tomography ( CT) scans were obtained for reconstruction of three-dimensional ( 3D) model of each lumbar vertebra , and further an individual guide template was designed. Then the templates and their corresponding vertebra were developed by rapid prototyping ( RP) technology. With the guide of the templates , screws were inserted via mini-open Wiltse approach. The positions of the screws were assessed based on postoperative CT images. In total , 120 pedicle screws inserted ( guide template group: n = 60 vs. free-hand group: n = 60). For all 30 vertebras in the guide template group , all pre-designed personalized drill guide templates can be fitted into the facet joints of each vertebra well. Furthermore , our results revealed a significant improvement for the guide template group in the accuracy rate ( p = 0.026). Armed with advantages of minimal invasion , enhanced accuracy and safety , the novel technique of multi-level drill guide template can be properly applied in pedicle screw placement for lumbar spine and promises to be a potential option in clinical application.
