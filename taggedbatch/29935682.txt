 The peritoneal malignancies span the biologic spectrum of aggressiveness from the indolent growth pattern and superficial nature of well-differentiated mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma to the rapidly growing and invasive nature of poorly differentiated signet ring cell adenocarcinomas of the appendix , colon , and stomach. An understanding of the biology , distribution , and volume of disease is critical to appropriately selecting patients for cytoreduction and HIPEC with the goal of long-term survival. Herein the authors discuss appropriate the evaluation and selection of patients for with peritoneal surface malignancies for cytoreduction and HIPEC.
