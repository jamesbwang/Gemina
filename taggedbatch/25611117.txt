 Migration has evolved among many animal taxa and migratory species are found across all major lineages. Insects are the most abundant and diverse terrestrial migrants , with trillions of animals migrating annually. Partial migration , where populations consist of resident and migratory individuals , is ubiquitous among many taxa. However , the underlying mechanisms are relatively poorly understood and may be driven by physiological , behavioural or genetic variation within populations. We investigated the differences in migratory tendency between migratory and resident phenotypes of the hoverfly ,
