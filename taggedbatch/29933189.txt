 Microbial fuel cell based biosensors ( MFC-biosensors) utilize anode biofilms as biological recognition elements to monitor biochemical oxygen demand ( BOD) and biotoxicity. However , the relatively poor sensitivity constrains the application of MFC-biosensors. To address this limitation , this study provided a systematic comparison of sensitivity between the MFC-biosensors constructed with two inocula. Higher biomass density and viability were both observed in the anode biofilm of the mixed culture MFC , which resulted in better sensitivity for BOD assessment. Compared with using mixed culture as inoculum , the anode biofilm developed with Shewanella<pathogen> loihica PV-4 presented lower content of extracellular polymeric substances and poorer ability to secrete protein under toxic<disease> shocks<disease><symptom>. Moreover , the looser structure in the S. loihica PV-4 biofilm further facilitated its susceptibilities to toxic agents. Therefore , the MFC-biosensor with a pure culture of S. loihica PV-4 delivered higher sensitivity for biotoxicity monitoring. This study proposed a new perspective to enhance sensor performance.
