 The lack of effective differential diagnostic methods for active tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) and latent infection ( LTBI) is still an obstacle for TB control. Furthermore , the molecular mechanism behind the progression from LTBI to active TB has been not elucidated. Therefore , we performed label-free quantitative proteomics to identify plasma biomarkers for discriminating pulmonary TB ( PTB) from LTBI. A total of 31 overlapping proteins with significant difference in expression level were identified in PTB patients (
