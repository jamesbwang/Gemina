 Backpacks with ergonomic features are recommended to mitigate the risk of developing low<symptom> back pain due to carrying a heavy school backpack. A repeated measure study was conducted on forty college age students to investigate the immediate changes in magnitude and timing aspects of lumbo-pelvic coordination when carrying a modified vs. a normal backpack relative to no backpack condition during trunk forward bending and backward return tasks. We found a smaller reduction in the thoracic range of rotation , an increase vs. a decrease in pelvic range of rotation , and a larger reduction in lumbar flexion for a modified vs. a normal backpack. Furthermore , during the forward bending a less in-phase motion for the modified backpack was observed. Our results suggest that participants have likely experienced larger spinal loads with the modified backpack; a conclusion that should be investigated in future to determine whether ergonomic backpacks can reduce the risk of low<symptom> back pain in children.
