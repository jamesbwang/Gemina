 To study the clinical effect of low molecular heparin on unexplained recurrent spontaneous<disease><symptom> abortion<disease><symptom> ( URSA). A total of 120 URSA patients were collected in our hospital from October 2015 to September 2017. They were divided into two groups: control group ( n = 60) and observation group ( n = 60). The patients in the control group were administered with progesterone and human chorionic gonadotropin , and the observation group with low molecular heparin. Pregnancy outcomes , incidence of complications in pregnancy and adverse drug reactions were compared in the two groups. The pregnancy success rate of patients in the observation group ( 90.00 %) is higher than that in the control group ( 68.33 %) ( p < 0.05). The incidence of complications in pregnancy in the observation group ( 90.00 %) is lower than those in the control group ( 68.33 %) ( p < 0.05). The incidence of adverse drug reactions between the patients in the observation group ( 20.00 %) and those in the control group ( 23.33 %) showed no significant difference ( p > 0.05). Low molecular heparin treatment can improve pregnancy success rate and reduce the incidence of complications in the URSA patients. Low molecular heparin is characterized by safety and reliability and has potential for application in clinic.
