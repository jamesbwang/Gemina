 The mirid bug , Apolygus lucorum Meyer-DÃ¼r , has been an important pest of cotton crop in China , and is primarily controlled with insecticides , such as pyrethroids. To elucidate the potential resistant mechanisms of A. lucorum to lambda-cyhalothrin , a series of biological , biochemical , and molecular assays were conducted in the reference ( AL-S) and lambda-cyhalothrin-resistant ( AL-R) populations. Comparison of the molecular target of pyrethroid insecticides , voltage-gated sodium channel , revealed that there were no mutation sites in the resistant population , indicating target insensitivity is not responsible for increased resistance of AL-R to lambda-cyhalothrin. Furthermore , the synergism assays and the activities of detoxification enzymes were performed to determine detoxification mechanism conferring the lambda-cyhalothrin resistance. In the tested synergists , the piperonyl butoxide had the highest synergism ratio against lambda-cyhalothrin , which was up to five-fold in both populations. In addition , the result also showed that only cytochrome P450 had significantly higher O-deethylase activity with 7-ethoxycoumarin ( 1.78-fold) in AL-R population compared with AL-S population. Seven cytochrome P450 genes were found to be significantly overexpressed in the resistant AL-R population compared with AL-S population. Taken together , these results demonstrate that multiple over-transcribed cytochrome P450 genes would be involved in the development of lambda-cyhalothrin resistance in AL-R population.
