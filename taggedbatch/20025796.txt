 The transient receptor potential ( TRP) ion channel family consists of a broad variety of non-selective cation channels that integrate environmental physicochemical signals for dynamic homeostatic control. Involved in a variety of cellular physiological processes , TRP channels are fundamental to the control of the cell life cycle. TRP channels from the vanilloid ( TRPV) family have been directly implicated in cell death. TRPV1 is activated by pain-inducing stimuli , including inflammatory endovanilloids and pungent exovanilloids , such as capsaicin ( CAP). TRPV1 activation by high doses of CAP ( > 10 Î¼M) leads to necrosis<symptom> , but also exhibits apoptotic characteristics. However , CAP dose-response studies are lacking in order to determine whether CAP-induced cell death occurs preferentially via necrosis<symptom> or apoptosis. In addition , it is not known whether cytosolic Ca
