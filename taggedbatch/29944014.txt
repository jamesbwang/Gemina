 Production for self-consumption can meet the principles of food safety such as respect for food habits and diversity. The participation of production for self-consumption in food availability was compared to the purchase of food for 30 days in 79 households ( 272 inhabitants) of the rural area of a Brazilian city in 2012. The food security was evaluated by the method `` Food energy deficiency in the domicile '' that classified 12.7 % of the households as insecure. In all households , staple foods ( rice , pasta , corn , beans , milk , eggs , meats) were available and more than 60 % had processed foods ( cookies , soft drinks). Only 22.7 % of the calories came from production for own consumption and the biggest expense was the purchase of carbohydrates ( 91.1 %) , mainly sugar ( 12.2 %). Evaluating only the energy availability of food is not sufficient since the quality and origin of food is of great relevance in the food security condition.
