 Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) is known as the most common arrhythmia and an independent risk factor for mortality. Recent studies suggest that AF is associated with morbidity and mortality in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy ( TTC). However , a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature have not been done. We assessed the association between AF in patients with TTC and mortality by a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis. We comprehensively searched the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to January 2018. Included studies were published prospective or retrospective cohort studies that compared all-cause mortality in TTC with AF versus without AF. Data from each study were combined using the random-effects , generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird to calculate risk ratios and 95 % confidence intervals. Five studies from August 2008 to October 2017 were included in this meta-analysis involving 2,321 subjects with TTC ( 243 with AF and 2,078 without AF). The presence of AF was associated with all-cause mortality ( pooled odds ratio = 2.19 , 95 % confidence interval: 1.57-3.06 , p < 0.001 , I Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> increased all-cause mortality by double among patients with TTC compared to without it. Our study suggests that the presence of AF in TTC is prognostic for all-cause mortality.
