 To determine the prevalence of gingival recession ( GR) and associations with dentine hypersensitivity<disease> ( DH) , erosive toothwear ( BEWE) , gingival bleeding ( BOP) and periodontal pocketing ( PPD) in young European adults. This is a secondary analysis using data collected from 350 UK participants enrolled in a European cross sectional study of 3187 young adults. GR , BOP , PPD , DH ( participant and clinician assessment) and BEWE were recorded. A questionnaire assessed demographics , oral hygiene and lifestyle habits. 349 participants completed the study. GR , BOP and PPD showed the same pattern of distribution , prevalence increasing from incisors to molars in upper and lower arches for buccal and palatal scores. Every participant exhibited recession affecting at least 1 tooth , 42 % having a maximum recession of 4-8 mm. There was a significant and linear association demonstrating an increase in maximum recession with age. DH and BEWE produced a similar pattern to buccal periodontal indices , the premolars being most affected. Maximum recession correlated significantly with maximum DH ( participant and Schiff) , PPD , BOP , BEWE ( scores of 2/3) , BMI ( â‰¥ 25 kg/m Widespread recession and gingivitis<disease> with minimal periodontal<disease> disease<disease> was observed. Every participant exhibited at least one tooth with recession. Many teeth did not exhibit DH despite prevalent recession and severe erosive toothwear. Recession correlates to a number of oral and lifestyle variables. Recession in young adults is multifactorial and highly prevalent. It can result in DH and consequential increase in demand for treatment relating to both pain and aesthetics. Further research is needed to understand the underlying aetiology to prevent recession occurring.
