 Thyroid hormone receptor β1 ( THRB1) and estrogen-related receptor α ( ESRRA; also known as ERRα) both play important roles in mitochondrial activity. To understand their potential interactions , we performed transcriptome and ChIP-seq analyses and found that many genes that were co-regulated by both THRB1 and ESRRA were involved in mitochondrial metabolic pathways. These included oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS) , the tricarboxylic acid ( TCA) cycle , and β-oxidation of fatty acids. TH increased ESRRA expression and activity in a THRB1-dependent manner through the induction of the transcriptional coactivator PPARGC1A ( also known as PGC1α). Moreover , TH induced mitochondrial biogenesis , fission , and mitophagy in an ESRRA-dependent manner. TH also induced the expression of the autophagy-regulating kinase ULK1 through ESRRA , which then promoted DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission. In addition , ULK1 activated the docking receptor protein FUNDC1 and its interaction with the autophagosomal protein MAP1LC3B-II to induce mitophagy. siRNA knockdown of
