 There are several automated analytical methods to detect thromboembolic vascular occlusions , the infarct core and the potential infarct-endangered tissue ( tissue at risk) by means of multimodal computed tomography ( CT) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). The infarct core is more reliably visualized by diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI) MRI or CT perfusion than by native CT.. The extent of tissue at risk and endangerment can only be estimated; however , it seems essential whether `` tissue at risk '' actually exists. To ensure consistent patient care , uniform imaging protocols should be acquired in the referring hospital and thrombectomy center and the collected data should be standardized and automatically evaluated and presented. Whether patients with a large infarct core and with or without tissue at risk or patients with large vessel occlusion ( LVO) but low NIHSS benefit from thrombectomy has to be evaluated in controlled clinical trials using standardized imaging protocols. A promising , potentially time-saving approach is also native CT and CT angiography using a flat-panel detector angiography system for assessment of vessel occlusion and leptomeningeal collaterals.
