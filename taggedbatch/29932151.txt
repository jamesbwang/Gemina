 Breast cancer , the second leading cause of female deaths worldwide , is usually treated with cytotoxic drugs , accompanied by adverse side-effects , development of chemoresistance and relapse of disease condition. Survival and proliferation of the cancer cells are greatly empowered by over-expression or over-activation of growth factor receptors and anti-apoptotic factors. Identification of these key players that cross-talk to each other , and subsequently , knockdown with their respective siRNAs in a synchronous manner could be a promising approach to precisely treat the cancer. Since siRNAs demonstrate limited cell permeability and unfavorable pharmacokinetic behaviors , pH-sensitive nanoparticles of carbonate apatite were employed to efficiently carry the siRNAs in vitro and in vivo. By delivering selective siRNAs against the mRNA transcripts of the growth factor receptors , such as ER , ERBB2 ( HER2) , EGFR and IGFR , and anti-apoptotic protein , such as BCL2 in human ( MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and murine ( 4T1) breast cancer cell lines , we found that ESR1 along with BCL-2 , or with ERBB2 and EGFR critically contributes to the growth/survival of the cancer cells by activating the MAPK and PI-3 kinase pathways. Furthermore , intravenous delivery of the selected siRNAs aiming to suppress the expression of ER/BCL2 and ER/ERBB2/EGFR groups of proteins led to a significant retardation in tumor growth in a 4T1-induced syngeneic mouse model.
