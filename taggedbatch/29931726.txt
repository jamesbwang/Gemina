 Numerous short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases ( SDRs) have found biocatalytic applications in C =O and C = C ( enone) reduction. For NADPH-dependent C = N reduction , imine reductases ( IREDs) have primarily been investigated due to their extended substrate range. Here , we show that SDRs are also suitable for a broad range of imine reductions. The SDR noroxomaritidine reductase ( NR) is involved in Amaryllidaceae alkaloid biosynthesis , serving as an enone reductase. We have characterized NR using a set of typical imine substrates and have established that the enzyme is active with all four tested imine compounds ( up to 99 % conversion , up to 92 % ee). Remarkably , NR reduced two keto compounds as well , highlighting this enzyme family 's versatility. Using NR as a template , we have identified an as yet unexplored SDR from the Amaryllidaceae Zephyranthes treatiae with imine-reducing activity ( up to 95 % ee). Our results encourage the future characterization of SDR family members as a means of discovering new imine-reducing enzymes.
