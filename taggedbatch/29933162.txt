 Di ( 2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP) is a commonly used , artificially-synthesized , industrial chemical that can be released into the soil. However , to date , there is no comprehensive study on the effects of DEHP on photosynthesis , induction of reactive oxygen species , and response of the antioxidant defense system in wheat plants growing in DEHP contaminated soil. This study was conducted to address this gap in knowledge. Our results showed that after application of 10 , 20 , and 40 mg/kg DEHP , photosynthetic parameters , fluorescence parameters , and chlorophyll content of wheat leaves at seedling , jointing , and booting stages decreased , while the intercellular carbon dioxide concentration increased. This indicates that the observed decrease in net photosynthetic rate in wheat leaves was due to a non-stomatal limitation , wherein DEHP seems to have hindered the photoelectron transfer process.
