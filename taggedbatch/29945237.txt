 Antimicrobial lock solutions are a low-cost strategy that can reduce the incidence of Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections ( CLABSI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of antimicrobial locks for the prevention of CLABSI. We constructed a decision-analytic model comparing antimicrobial lock solutions to heparin locks for the prevention of CLABSI in three settings: hemodialysis , cancer treatment and home parenteral nutrition. Cost-effectiveness was determined by calculating CLABSI prevented and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ( ICER). Uncertainty was addressed by plotting cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves for various willingness-to-pay thresholds. In probabilistic analysis , at a willingness-to-pay of $ 50,000 , antimicrobial lock solutions had a 96.24 % chance of being cost-effective compared to heparin locks in the hemodialysis setting , an 88.00 % chance in the cancer treatment setting , and a 92.73 % chance in the home parenteral nutrition setting. In base-case analysis , antimicrobial lock solutions resulted in savings of $ 68,721.03 for the hemodialysis setting , $ 85,061.41 for the cancer setting , and $ 78,513.83 for the home parenteral nutrition setting per CLABSI episode prevented. In three distinct and clinically important settings ( hemodialysis , cancer treatment patients and home parenteral nutrition) , antimicrobial lock solutions are an effective strategy for the prevention of CLABSI and their use can result in significant health-care savings.
