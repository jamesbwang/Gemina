 Gossypium barbadense ( Sea Island , Egyptian or Pima cotton) cotton has high fiber quality , however , few studies have investigated the genetic basis of its traits using molecular markers. Genome complexity reduction approaches such as genotyping-by-sequencing have been utilized to develop abundant markers for the construction of high-density genetic maps to locate quantitative trait loci ( QTLs). The Chinese G. barbadense cultivar 5917 and American Pima S-7 were used to develop a recombinant inbred line ( RIL) population with 143 lines. The 143 RILs together with their parents were tested in three replicated field tests for lint yield traits ( boll weight and lint percentage) and fiber quality traits ( fiber length , fiber elongation , fiber strength , fiber uniformity and micronaire) and then genotyped using GBS to develop single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) markers. A high-density genetic map with 26 linkage groups ( LGs) was constructed using 3557 GBS SNPs spanning a total genetic distance of 3076.23 cM at an average density of 1.09 cM between adjacent markers. A total of 42 QTLs were identified , including 24 QTLs on 12 LGs for fiber quality and 18 QTLs on 7 LGs for lint yield traits , with LG1 ( 9 QTLs) , LG10 ( 7 QTLs) and LG14 ( 6 QTLs) carrying more QTLs. Common QTLs for the same traits and overlapping QTLs for different traits were detected. Each individual QTLs explained 0.97 to 20.7 % of the phenotypic variation. This study represents one of the first genetic mapping studies on the fiber quality and lint yield traits in a RIL population of G. barbadense using GBS-SNPs. The results provide important information for the subsequent fine mapping of QTLs and the prediction of candidate genes towards map-based cloning and marker-assisted selection in cotton.
