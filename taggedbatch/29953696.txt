 Intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH) is the most feared complication in patients treated with oral anticoagulants due to non-valvular atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>. Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants ( NOACs) reduce the risk of ICH compared with vitamin K antagonists ( VKAs). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of fatal NOAC-related ICH compared with VKA-related ICH. We calculated the corresponding risk ratios ( RRs) in each included study to express the relative risk of fatal ICH amongst all patients receiving oral anticoagulation with either NOACs or VKAs. We additionally evaluated the mortality rates in NOAC-related ICH in patients treated with and without NOAC-specific reversal agents ( idarucizumab and factor Xa inhibitors antidote). Case fatality was evaluated at 30-90 days following symptom onset. Our literature search identified six eligible studies ( four randomized controlled trials and two open-label trials of NOAC-specific reversal agents). In pairwise analyses , NOACs were found to have a lower risk of fatal ICH compared with VKAs ( RR , 0.46; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.36-0.58) with no heterogeneity ( I Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants halve the risk of fatal ICH in patients with non-valvular atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> compared with VKAs , whereas indirect comparisons indicate that NOAC-specific reversal agents may be associated with a lower case fatality rate in NOAC-related ICH.
