 Therapeutic strategies for managing hemorrhagic moyamoya disease ( MMD) remain controversial. In this study , we investigated the optimal therapy for hemorrhagic MMD. In accordance with the PRISMA statement , we searched through relevant articles and references from PubMed , Embase , and Cochrane database , and performed a network meta-analysis using R version 3.4.4 software. A total of 9 articles ( including 1050 patients) were included in our analysis. Of these 1050 patients , 557 underwent surgical revascularization ( including direct and indirect bypass) , and the remaining 493 patients were managed with a conservative treatment regimen. A pooled analysis revealed that surgical revascularization was superior to the conservative treatment regimen in decreasing the rate of recurrent stroke events ( odds ratio ( OR) , 0.39; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.24-0.65) , including ischemic stroke recurrence ( OR , 0.31; 95 % CI , 0.12-0.79) and hemorrhage<symptom> recurrence ( OR , 0.45; 95 % CI , 0.26-0.79) , but not in reducing mortality ( OR , 0.53; 95 % CI , 0.24-1.17). Moreover , the incidence of recurrent stroke in the direct bypass cohort was lower than that for either the conservative treatment cohort ( OR , 0.30; 95 % CI , 0.15-0.58) or the indirect bypass cohort ( OR , 0.39; 95 % CI , 0.18-0.87). However , the ratios showed no statistically significant difference between the latter 2 cohorts ( OR , 0.75; 95 % CI , 0.33-1.68). Surgical revascularization , especially a direct bypass regimen , may be the optimal strategy for treating hemorrhagic MMD.
