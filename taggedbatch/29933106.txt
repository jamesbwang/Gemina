 Blood vessel disease is a major contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and is hallmarked by dysfunction of the lining endothelial cells ( ECs). These cells play a significant role in vascular homeostasis , through the release of mediators to control vessel diameter , hence tissue perfusion. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles ( MSNs) can be used as potential drug delivery platforms for vasodilator drugs. Here , using an ex vivo model of vascular function , we examine the use of titania coating for improved biocompatibility and release dynamics of MSN loaded sodium nitroprusside ( SNP). MSNs ( 95 Â± 23 nm diameter; pore size 2.7 nm) were synthesised and fully characterised. They were loaded with SNP and coated with titania ( TiO Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide , with a total global cost of over $ 918 billion , by 2030. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles ( MSNs) have great potential for the delivery of drugs that can treat vessel disease. This paper provides the first description for the use of titania coated MSNs with increased vascular penetration , for the delivery of vasodilator drugs , without compromising overall vessel function. We demonstrate that titania coating of MSNs significantly improves their biocompatibility and uptake within aortic blood vessels and furthermore , enables a slower and more sustained release of the vasodilator drug , sodium nitroprusside within the vessel , thus making them an attractive strategy for the treatment of vascular disease.
