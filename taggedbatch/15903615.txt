 Metamaterial full-sized absorber structures are numerically and experimentally investigated in GHz region and then examined in THz frequency. By manipulating monitoring the number and the position of the defect elements in conventional unit cells , the optimal integrative absorber structures are generated. The proposed structures provide an ultra-broadband absorbance in the operating frequency. The good agreement between simulation , measurement and theoretical analysis is observed with a 5 GHz-bandwidth corresponding to the absorption of 95 %. In particular , we extrapolate the concept to THz region and demonstrate that , the method can be applied to increase the bandwidth of the metamaterial absorber to 5 THz , while maintaining the other characteristics. This structure can be applied to improve the performance of telecommunication systems such as micro-antenna , micro-electromagnetic transmitters and apply to imaging and sensing fields.
