 The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin and the glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1) receptor agonist exenatide reduce bodyweight via differing and complementary mechanisms. This post hoc analysis investigated the metabolic effects and baseline associations with bodyweight loss on coadministration of dapagliflozin and exenatide once weekly ( QW) among adults with obesity and without diabetes. In the primary trial , adults with obesity and without diabetes ( n = 50; 18-70 years; body mass index ( BMI) 30-45 kg/m Compared with placebo at 24 weeks , 2-h FFAs post-OGTT increased ( mean difference , +20.4 Î¼mol/l; P < 0.05) , and fasting glucose , 2-h glucose post-OGTT , and glucose area under the concentration-time curve ( AUC) decreased with DAPA + ExQW ( mean differences , -0.68 mmol/l ( P < 0.001) , -2.20 mmol/l ( P < 0.01) , and -306 mmol/l min ( P < 0.001) , respectively). Glucagon , glycerol , beta-OH-butyrate , and IGI did not differ by treatment group at 24 weeks. Over 52 weeks , DAPA + ExQW decreased fasting insulin , 2-h post-OGTT insulin , and insulin AUC. Among DAPA + ExQW-treated participants , for each copy of the SNP variant rs10010131 A allele ( gene WFS1) , bodyweight decreased by 2.4 kg ( P < 0.05). Lower BMI and a lower IGI were also associated with greater bodyweight loss with DAPA + ExQW. Metabolic effects with DAPA + ExQW included less FFA suppression versus placebo during the OGTT , suggesting compensatory lipid mobilization for energy production when glucose availability was reduced because of glucosuria. The expected increase in glucagon with DAPA did not occur with DAPA + ExQW coadministration. Bodyweight loss with DAPA + ExQW was associated with the SNP variant rs10010131 A allele , lower baseline adiposity ( BMI) , and lower baseline insulin secretion ( IGI). These findings require further validation. AstraZeneca.
