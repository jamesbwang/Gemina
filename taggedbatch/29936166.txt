 Greenhouse gas ( GHG) emissions from rivers and lakes have been shown to contribute significantly to global carbon and nitrogen cycling. In temperate and human-impacted regions , simultaneous carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide emissions from aquatic systems are poorly documented. We estimated carbon dioxide ( CO
