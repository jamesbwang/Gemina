 The migration behaviours of Li + in three garnet- and one NASICON-type solid oxide electrolytes were studied on the micrometre scale by pulsed-gradient spin-echo ( PGSE) 7Li NMR diffusion spectroscopy to clarify common and specific characteristics of each electrolyte. In these solid electrolytes , clear evidences of grain boundary effects in the diffusion of Li + were not observed. The Li + diffusion constants were dependent on parameters such as observation time ( Δ) and pulsed field gradient ( PFG) strength ( g) for all the studied inorganic solid electrolytes. For low Δ values , Li + ions underwent collisions and diffractions with diffraction distance Rdiffraction ( μm). The apparent Li + diffusion constants ( Dapparent ( m2 s-1)) exhibited distributions in a wide range. In this paper , we introduced the apparent diffusion radius , rradius ( μm) , and compared it with Rdiffraction and mean square displacement ( MSD) ( μm); the lengths of these distances were of the micrometre order ( 10-6 m). The relations between the values of rradius , Rdiffraction and MSD suggested that the migration behaviours of Li + on the micrometre scale were complicated. Using high Δ and high g values , we obtained an equilibrated value of DLi. The temperature dependences of the number of carrier ions were estimated from the DLi values and ionic conductivities in the four solid oxide electrolytes. For simple comparison and reference , the data of DLi and ionic conductivity of LiPF6 in 1 M solution of propylene carbonate were added.
