 Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus ( SRBSDV) , a genus Fijivirus of the family Reoviridae , could result in the significant crop losses because being short of an effective controlling measures. Cytosinpeptidemycin , a microbial pesticides developed by China , displayed a wide antiviral activity against many plant viruses. However , its underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study , a total of 2321 proteins were identified using label-free proteomics technology. Compared with the treatment of SRBSDV-infected rice , 84 and 207 proteins were detected to be up-regulated and only presented in treatment group of SDBSDV-infected rice pre-treated by Cytosinpeptidemycin , which were partially enriched to stress and defense response , such as pathogenesis-related protein 5 ( PR-5) , pathogenesis-related protein 10 ( PR-10) and heat shock<symptom> protein ( Hsp protein). Meanwhile , the real-time quantitative PCR ( RT-qPCR) showed that Cytosinpeptidemycin could also up-regulate some resistance genes , and these results indicated a similar trends with the data of the label-free proteomics. Moreover , Cytosinpeptidemycin could enhance the defense enzymatic activities of peroxidase ( POD) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , and catalase ( CAT). These data offer a more comprehensive view about the response of SRBSDV-infected rice triggered by Cytosinpeptidemycin in the level of the proteome , mRNA and enzymatic activity.
