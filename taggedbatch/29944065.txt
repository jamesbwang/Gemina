 Purpose The aim of this review was to integrate empirical and theoretical literature on fatigue<symptom> among adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM). A methodological review using an integrative approach was used. Databases MEDLINE via Pubmed , CINAHL , PsycINFO , and Science Direct were searched for peer-reviewed articles published in English from 2007-2017 , using the following search terms and Boolean operators: `` Type 1 Diabetes '' and `` Fatigue<symptom>. '' Of 199 articles initially retrieved , 14 were chosen for inclusion. These articles included 13 quantitative ( 7 cross-sectional , 2 cohort , 2 secondary data analyses , 2 experimental) and 1 qualitative phenomenology. Fatigue<symptom> was identified as one of the most troublesome symptoms reported in persons with T1DM. Four main themes emerged: fatigue<symptom> in T1DM is multidimensional and related to psychological , physiological , situational , and sociodemographic factors. Conclusions Fatigue<symptom> is considered a classic symptom of hyperglycemia; however , there were minimal data to support the theory that fatigue<symptom> is related to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. Studies on fatigue<symptom> among persons with T1DM are limited to small samples and cross-sectional designs with few randomized controlled trials addressing fatigue<symptom> and diabetes-related symptoms. Evidence is conflicting regarding the onset of fatigue<symptom> among persons with T1DM and the relationship between fatigue<symptom> and diabetes duration. The prevalence of fatigue<symptom> is likely influenced by disease physiology , psychological stress , and lifestyle factors , but more research is needed to confirm these relationships as causal inference is unclear.
