 To report the perioperative adverse events associated with nerve-preserving sacropexy for pelvic organ prolapse ( POP) repair and to identify risk factors that could predict possible adverse events. A total of 768 women who underwent sacropexy for POP repair performed by one surgeon using the same technique , beyond the learning curve , over a 10-year period , between January 1st 2007 and December 31st 2016. The medical records of 768 women were reviewed for age , body mass index ( BMI) , tobacco use , previous surgeries ( for POP and incontinence , abdominal surgeries in general) , operating time , duration of hospitalization and perioperative events at time of surgery and 6 weeks postoperatively. Additionally , the complications were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo grading system and the Charlson Age Comorbidity Index ( CACI) was evaluated for the patients. Between January 1st 2007 and December 31st 2016 , 768 patients underwent sacropexy for POP. 27 ( 3.5 %) adverse events occurred intra- and post-operative within 6 weeks after surgery. In univariate and multivariate analyses , only comorbidity and concomitant posterior colporrhaphy are significantly associated with complications. Surgeon 's experience and a standardized technique minimize the risk of perioperative adverse events. The data on complications we found can be used to guide effective consent.
