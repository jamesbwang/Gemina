 Investigate the developmental physiology of the temporomandibular joint ( TMJ) , a unique articulation between the cranium and the mandible. Principal regulatory factors for TMJ and disc development are Indian hedgehog ( IHH) and bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP-2). The mechanism is closely associated with ear morphogenesis. Secondary condylar cartilage emerges as a subperiosteal blastema on the medial surface of the posterior mandible. The condylar articular surface is immunoreactive for tenascin-C , so it is a modified fibrous periosteum with an underlying proliferative zone ( cambrium layer) that differentiates into fibrocartilage. The latter cushions high loads and subsequently produces endochondral bone. The TMJ is a heavily loaded joint with three cushioning layers of fibrocartilage in the disc , as well as in subarticular zones in the fossa and mandibular condyle. The periosteal articular surface produces fibrocartilage to resist heavy loads , and has unique healing and adaptive properties for maintaining life support functions under adverse environmental conditions.
