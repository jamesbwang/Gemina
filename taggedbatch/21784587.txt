 To determine the relationship between maternal anxiety<symptom> and cortisol values and birth weight at various stages of pregnancy. Two hundred sixteen pregnant Chinese women were assessed for anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> and had measurement of morning fasting serum cortisol. Women were assessed either in the first ( 71) , second ( 72) or third ( 73) trimester. Birth weights of all children were recorded. There were significant negative correlations between anxiety<symptom> level and birth weight of- 0.507 ( p < 0.01) and- 0.275 ( p < 0.05) in trimesters 1and 2. In trimester 3 the negative relation between anxiety<symptom> and birth weight of -.209 failed to reach significance ( p = 0.070). There was no relation between depression<symptom> and birth weight in any trimester ( p > 0.5 for all). Maternal cortisol was significantly inversely related to birth weight in trimester 1 ( r =- 0.322) and with borderline significance in trimester 2 ( r =- 0.229). Anxiety<symptom> score and maternal cortisol were significantly correlated in each trimester ( r = 0.551 , 0.650 , 0.537). When both anxiety<symptom> score and maternal cortisol were simultaneously included in multiple regression analyses only anxiety<symptom> score remained significant. Whilst both maternal anxiety<symptom> score and maternal cortisol are inversely related to birth weight the associations with anxiety<symptom> score were more robust perhaps indicating the importance of mechanisms other than , or in addition to , maternal cortisol in mediating the effects of anxiety<symptom>. The findings indicate the importance of measures to reduce maternal anxiety<symptom> , particularly of a severe degree , at all stages of pregnancy. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the 1st Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University.
