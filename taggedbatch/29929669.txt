 The purpose of this study was to identify clinical factors associated with arrhythmic events and sudden cardiac death ( SCD) , and to evaluate the prognostic value of electrophysiological study ( EPS) in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia ( ARVC/D) patients without implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs). ARVC/D is an inherited cardiomyopathy characterized by a risk of SCD. Few studies have evaluated predictive factors of ventricular arrhythmias ( VAs) in patients without ICDs. Between 2000 and 2010 , all consecutive patients with ARVC/D without ICDs and with EPS at diagnosis were enrolled. Patients that received an ICD during follow-up were censored at the date of implantation , and in that case , only VAs that occurred before ICD implantation were analyzed. Risk factors for any VA event were determined by Cox regression. Patients that only experienced SCD or aborted cardiac arrest ( ACA) were reported. A total of 137 consecutive patients ( 78 % male) diagnosed with ARVC/D without ICD were enrolled. 31 % had sustained ventricular tachycardia<symptom> at diagnosis. After mean follow-up of 42 ± 31 months , 19 patients experienced an episode of sustained VA and 5 patients experienced a SCD/ACA. No event occurred in asymptomatic patients. Left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 50 % ( p = 0.024) , positive EPS ( p = 0.017) , and physical activity > 6 h/week ( p = 0.025) were independently associated with occurrence of VAs. SCD/ACA exclusively occurred in male probands with definite diagnosis and syncope. In this cohort of ARVC/D patients without ICD , left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 50 % , positive EPS , and physical activity > 6 h/week were independent predictors of VAs , whereas asymptomatic patients at diagnosis were at low risk. EPS predicted all VAs but had limited value to predict SCD/ACA.
