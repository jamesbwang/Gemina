 Coronary PET shows promise in the detection of high-risk atherosclerosis , but there remains a need to optimize imaging and reconstruction techniques. We investigated the impact of reconstruction parameters and cardiac motion-correction in Twenty-two patients underwent Reconstruction using 24 subsets , 4 iterations , point-spread-function modelling , time of flight , and 5-mm post-filtering provided the highest median SNR ( 31.5) compared to 4 iterations 0-mm ( 22.5) , 8 iterations 0-mm ( 21.1) , and 8 iterations 5-mm ( 25.6; all P < .05). Motion-correction improved SNR of culprit lesions<symptom> ( n = 33) ( 24.5 ( 19.9-31.5)) compared to diastolic ( 15.7 ( 12.4-18.1); P < .001) and summed data ( 22.1 ( 18.9-29.2); P < .001). Motion-correction increased the SNR difference between culprit and reference lesions<symptom> ( 10.9 ( 6.3-12.6)) compared to diastolic ( 6.2 ( 3.6-10.3); P = .001) and summed data ( 7.1 ( 4.8-11.6); P = .001). The number of iterations and extent of post-filtering has marked effects on coronary
