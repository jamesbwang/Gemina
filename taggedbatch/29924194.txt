 To evaluate the outcomes of the first 30 cataract surgeries performed with a new disposable , injector-free , small-pupil expansion device. This consecutive case series included 30 eyes from 29 patients who underwent cataract surgery using a new disposable small-pupil expansion device called the Canabrava Ring ( AJL Ophthalmic S.A , Spain). It is the first iris expansion ring produced with indents that do not align with each other in the superior and inferior regions , resulting in a small vertical length ( 0.4 mm) that minimizes the risk of endothelial contact. All eyes had poorly dilated pupils of less than 5 mm preoperatively. Fifteen eyes had significant infective or traumatic pathologies preoperatively. Vertical and horizontal pupil diameters were evaluated preoperatively , intraoperatively , and 1 month postoperatively. The mean patient age was 64 Â± 11.8 ( standard deviation) years. The Canabrava Ring remained engaged throughout all surgeries , except one. All pupils were intraoperatively expanded to a diameter of 6.3 mm. Although preexisting pathology on the innervation of the pupils , the mean pupil diameter returns to a close preoperative size after 1 month surgery. The mean pupil diameters postoperatively and preoperatively were 4.41 and 3.77 mm , respectively ( p < 0.05). Postoperative complications occurred in eight eyes ( one toxoplasmosis<disease> reactivation , one retinal detachment , one posterior capsule rupture , one posterior capsule opacification , and four posterior synechiae). These complications occurred in eyes with preexisting traumatic or infective pathologies or synechiae. The Canabrava Ring is effective for expanding and maintaining expansion of small pupils in cataract surgery. The increase in postoperative pupil diameter is clinically diminutive and can most likely be attributed to preexisting pathologies affecting pupil innervation. Further large-scale studies are required to support the present findings.
