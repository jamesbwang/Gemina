 Ling zhi-8 ( LZ-8) is the first fungal immunomodulatory protein ( FIP) isolated from the lingzhi or reishi medicinal mushroom , Ganoderma lucidum. LZ-8 effectively induces interleukin 2 expression and secretion by forming a stable homodimer , and it is regarded as a good candidate to become a new therapeutic agent and/or functional food supplement. However , the molecular mechanism by which LZ-8 dimerization influences the regulation of interleukin 2 is not clear. In this study we performed structure-based multiple alignment of LZ-8 and an FIP from Volvariella volvacea , compared the electrostatic potential of their protein surfaces , and developed a model summarizing the unique electrostatic interaction in LZ-8 dimerization. In addition , further electrostatic potential and virtual amino acid mutation analyses suggested that L10 , W12 , and D45 are the key amino acid residues responsible for the protein 's high immunomodulatory activity. These findings may provide useful insights into the design and construction of a new FIP mutant for use in treating and preventing autoimmune diseases.
