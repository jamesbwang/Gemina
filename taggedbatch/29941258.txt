 This study aimed to evaluate the suitability of two bioaerosol generation systems ( dry and wet generation) for the aerosolization of microorganisms isolated from the International Space Station , and to calibrate the produced bioaerosols to fulfill the requirements of computational fluid dynamics model ( CFD) validation. Concentration , stability , size distribution , agglomeration of generated bioaerosol and deposition of bioaerosols were analyzed. In addition , the dispersion of non-viable particles in the air was studied. Experiments proved that wet generation from microbial suspensions could be used for the production of well-calibrated and stabile bioaerosols for model validation. For the simulation of the natural release of fungal spores , a dry generation method should be used. This study showed that the used CFD model simulated the spread of non-viable particles fairly well. The mathematical deposition model by Lai and Nazaroff could be used to estimate the deposition velocities of bioaerosols on surfaces , although it somewhat underestimated the measured deposition velocities.
