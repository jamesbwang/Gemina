 The industry of açai-based products has been growing in the last few years. Knowledge about the physical properties of açai pulp , including its rheology , is essential to the optimization of industrial processes. This work presents the rheological behavior of açai berry pulp in relation to the effects of shear rate , temperature , and time of shearing. The entire study was carried out in the temperature range of 10-70 °C. Açai pulp showed a non-Newtonian , pseudoplastic , and time-dependent behavior. Four upward and backward shear rate cycles were evaluated , resulting in complex hysteresis loops , in which thixotropy and anti-thixotropy zones were observed. Downward flow curves could be satisfactorily represented by the Power-Law rheological model. The stress profiles as a function of shear rate obtained in the first upward curves suggest a breakdown of the initial fluid structure at low shear rates. Tests were also carried out at a constant shear rate of 20 s
