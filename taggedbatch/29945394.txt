 The loss of hippocampal neurons is one of the main pathological features of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) , which is related to the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. Huangpu Tongqiao capsule is used for the treatment of AD , but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. This study is to investigate the mechanism of neuroprotective effect of Huangpu Tongqiao capsule in the treatment of AD , through observing the effect of Huangpu Tongqiao capsule containing serum on cell injury of primary cultured hippocampal neurons induced by Aβ ₂₅ ₋₃₅ via inhibiting the cell apoptosis. Primary cultured hippocampal neurons were cultured and identified by MAP-2 immunofluorescence staining , and cell growth state was observed by inverted microscope. The Huangpu Tongqiao capsule containing serum was prepared using the method of serum pharmacology. MTT assays were used to measure the optimum concentration range of Huangpu Tongqiao capsule containing serum , and optimum Aβ concentration for establishing the AD model. After primary cultured hippocampal neurons AD cell model was induced by Aβ ₂₅ ₋₃₅ , cell survival rate was detected by MTT , cell apoptosis rate was assayed by flow cytometry , and protein expressions of Bax , Cyt C and caspase-3 were determined by Western blot analysis. The results showed that the primary cultured hippocampal neurons were cultured successfully , and cells grew mature at seventh days; Compared with normal group , the survival rate of hippocampal neurons in AD cell model group was decreased , the apoptosis rate of hippocampal neurons was increased , and the protein expressions of Bax , Cyt C and caspase-3 were increased (
