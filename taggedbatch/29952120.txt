 Most metal hyperaccumulating plants accumulate nickel , yet the molecular basis of Ni hyperaccumulation is not well understood. We chose Senecio coronatus<pathogen> to investigate this phenomenon as this species displays marked variation in shoot Ni content across ultramafic outcrops in the Barberton Greenstone Belt ( South Africa) , thus allowing an intraspecific comparative approach to be employed. No correlation between soil and shoot Ni contents was observed , suggesting that this variation has a genetic rather than environmental basis. This was confirmed by our observation that the accumulation phenotype of plants from two hyperaccumulator and two non-accumulator populations was maintained when the plants were grown on a soil mix from these four sites for 12 months. We analysed the genetic variation among 12 serpentine populations of S. coronatus<pathogen> , and used RNA-seq for de novo transcriptome assembly and analysis of gene expression in hyperaccumulator versus non-accumulator populations. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of hyperaccumulators in two well supported evolutionary lineages , indicating that Ni hyperaccumulation may have evolved more than once in this species. RNA-Seq analysis indicated that putative homologues of transporters associated with root iron uptake in plants are expressed at elevated levels in roots and shoots of hyperaccumulating populations of S. coronatus<pathogen> from both evolutionary lineages. We hypothesise that Ni hyperaccumulation in S. coronatus<pathogen> may have evolved through recruitment of these transporters , which play a role in the iron-deficiency response in other plant species.
