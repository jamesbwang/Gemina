 To compare the performance of synthetic mammography ( SM) and digital mammography ( DM) with digital breast tomosynthesis ( DBT) or alone for the evaluation of microcalcifications. This retrospective study includes 198 mammography cases , all with DM , SM , and DBT images , from January to October 2013. Three radiologists interpreted images and recorded the presence of microcalcifications and their conspicuity scores and final BI-RADS categories ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4a , 4b , 4c , 5). Readers ' area under the ROC curves ( AUCs) were analyzed for SM plus DBT vs. DM plus DBT and SM alone vs. DM alone using the BI-RADS categories for the overall group and dense breast subgroup. Conspicuity scores of detected microcalcifications were neither significantly different between SM and DM with DBT nor alone ( p > 0.05). In predicting malignancy of detected microcalcifications , no significant difference was found between readers ' AUCs for SM and DM with DBT or alone in the overall group or dense breast subgroup ( p > 0.05). Diagnostic performances of SM and DM for the evaluation of microcalcifications are not significantly different , whether performed with DBT or alone. • In DBT-imaging , SM and DM show comparable performances when evaluating microcalcifications. • For BI-RADS classification of microcalcifications , SM and DM show similar AUCs. • DBT with SM may be sufficient for diagnosing microcalcifications , without DM.
