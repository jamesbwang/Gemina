 As treatment improves , people living with HIV<pathogen> ( PLWHIV) can now expect to live longer , which means that the foci of HIV-related care for them and their medical practitioners continue to change. With an increasingly older cohort of patients with HIV<pathogen> infection , practitioners ' key considerations are shifting from issues of acute treatment and patient survival to multiple comorbidities , toxicities associated with chronic therapy , and ongoing health maintenance. Within this context , this paper explores the current standard of practice for the management of HIV<pathogen> infection in Australia. We surveyed 56 Australian practitioners currently involved in managing HIV<pathogen> infection: ` HIV<pathogen> section 100 ' ( HIV<pathogen> therapy-prescribing) general practitioners ( s100 GPs; n = 26) , sexual health physicians ( SHPs; n = 24) and hospital-based physicians ( HBPs; n = 6). Survey results for practice approaches and challenges were broadly consistent across the three practitioner specialties , apart from a few key areas. s100 GPs reported less prophylaxis use among patients whom they deemed at risk of HIV<pathogen> infection in comparison with SHPs , which may reflect differences in patient populations. Further , a higher proportion of s100 GPs nominated older HIV<pathogen> treatment regimens as their preferred therapy choices compared with the other specialties. In contrast with SHPs , s100 GPs were less likely to switch HIV<pathogen> therapies to simplify the treatment protocol , and to immediately initiate treatment upon patient request in those newly diagnosed with HIV<pathogen> infection. Considerably lower levels of satisfaction with current HIV<pathogen> practice guidelines were also reported by s100 GPs. It appears that greater support for s100 GPs may be needed to address these identified challenges and enhance approaches to HIV<pathogen> practice. Across all specialties , increasing access to mental health services for patients with HIV<pathogen> infection was reported as a key management issue. A renewed focus on providing improved mental health and wellbeing supports is recommended , particularly in the face of an ageing HIV-infected population.
