 T-wave alternans ( TWA) , a marker of electrical instability , can be modulated by cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT). The relationship between TWA and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> response to CRT has not been clearly defined. In 40-patients ( age 65 ± 11 years , left ventricular ejection-fraction ( LVEF) 23 ± 7 %) , TWA was evaluated prospectively at median of 2 months ( baseline) and 8 months ( follow-up) post-CRT implant. TWA-magnitude ( Valt > 0μV , k ≥ 3) , its duration ( d) , and burden ( Valt · d) were quantified in moving 128-beat segments during incremental atrial<symptom> ( AAI , native-TWA) and atrio-biventricular ( DDD-CRT) pacing. The immediate and long-term effect of CRT on TWA was examined. Clinical response to CRT was defined as an increase in LVEF of ≥ 5 %. Native-TWA was clinically significant ( Valt ≥ 1.9 μV , k ≥ 3) in 68 % of subjects at baseline. Compared to native-TWA at baseline , DDD-CRT pacing at baseline and follow-up reduced the number of positive TWA segments , peak-magnitude , longest-duration and peak-burden of TWA ( 44 ± 5 to 33 ± 5 to 28 ± 4 % , p = 0.02 and 0.002; 5.9 ± 0.8 to 4.1 ± 0.7 to 3.8 ± 0.7 μV , p = 0.01 and 0.01; 97 ± 9 to 76 ± 8 to 67 ± 8sec , p = 0.004 and < 0.001; and 334 ± 65 to 178 ± 58 to 146 ± 54μV. sec , p = 0.01 and 0.004). In addition , the number of positive segments and longest-duration of native-TWA diminished during follow-up ( 44 ± 5 to 35 ± 6 % , p = 0.044; and 97 ± 9 to 81 ± 9sec , p = 0.02). Clinical response to CRT was observed in 71 % of patients; the reduction in DDD-CRT paced TWA both at baseline and follow-up was present only in responders ( interaction p-values < 0.1). Long-term CRT reduces the prevalence and magnitude of TWA. This CRT induced beneficial electrical remodeling is a marker of clinical response after CRT.
