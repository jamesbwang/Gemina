 Patient participation is the cornerstone for effective physiotherapy intervention. The aim was to analyze how patients and physiotherapists negotiate symptoms during exercise therapy and describe patients ' participation during this process. Nineteen consultations with sixteen patients and six physiotherapists were video-recorded in two Hong Kong outpatient settings. Conversation Analysis was used to uncover interactional aspects of symptom-talk , focusing on turn-taking , sequence organization , and vocabulary. Physiotherapists explored patients ' symptoms only minimally and their frequent use of closed-ended questions allowed limited opportunity for participation. For patient-initiated symptom-talk , less than half elicited actions from physiotherapists , whose minimal acknowledgments were often accepted. Yet , some patients achieved a more substantial contribution through: ( 1) pausing the exercise-in-progress; ( 2) gazing at the physiotherapist; ( 3) pointing at the painful area; and ( 4) interrupting the physiotherapist , thereby challenging the social order. While discussion about symptoms was often initiated by physiotherapists , some patients participated actively by engaging in certain communicative strategies. Patient participation can be improved by physiotherapists offering a supportive environment ( i.e. , question design , responding to patients ' initiations , and promoting health literacy) , and by patients embracing action-engendering communicative strategies. The fine details of interaction shed light onto the subtleties of symptom-talk initiated by patients or physiotherapists in physiotherapy.
