 Recently , microalgae have attracted attention as sources of biomass energy. However , fatty acids from the microalgae are mainly unsaturated and show low stability in oxygenated environments , due to oxidation of the double bonds. The branched-chain fatty acid , 10-methyl stearic acid , is synthesized from oleic acid in certain bacteria; the fatty acid is saturated , but melting point is low. Thus , it is stable in the presence of oxygen and is highly fluid. We previously demonstrated that BfaA and BfaB in Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> chlorophenolicum are involved in the synthesis of 10-methyl stearic acid from oleic acid. In this study , as a consequence of the introduction of bfaA and bfaB into the cyanobacterium , Synechocystis sp.. PCC 6803 , we succeeded in producing 10-methyl stearic acid , with yields up to 4.1 % of the total fatty acid content. The synthesis of 10-methyl stearic acid in Synechocystis cells did not show a significant effect on photosynthetic activity , but the growth of the cells was retarded at 34 Â°C. We observed that the synthesis of 10-methylene stearic acid , a precursor of 10-methyl stearic acid , had an inhibitory effect on the growth of the transformants , which was mitigated under microoxic conditions. Eventually , the amount of 10-methyl stearic acid present in the sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol of the transformants was remarkably higher than that in the monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and digalactosyldiacylglycerol. Overall , we successfully synthesized 10-methyl stearic acid in the phototroph , Synechocystis , demonstrating that it is possible to synthesize unique modified fatty acids via photosynthesis that are not naturally produced in photosynthetic organisms.
