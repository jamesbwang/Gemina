 Molecular motors<symptom> undergo repetitive directional motions upon external energy input. A profound challenge is the defined transfer of directional motor motions to remote entities at the molecular scale. Herein , we present a molecular setup that allows for the transfer of the directional rotation of a light-powered motor unit onto a remote biaryl axis via an ethylene glycol chain link. Based on a combination of X-ray crystallographic analysis , ECD , and NMR experiments as well as a comprehensive theoretical assessment , we provide evidence for the coupled stepwise directional motions of both molecular units. With the presented setup , facile integration of molecular motor units into larger functional frameworks and complex molecular machines can be explored consciously in the future.
