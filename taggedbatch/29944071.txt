 Comorbid mental illness is common in patients with intellectual disability. Antipsychotics are widely used for these conditions , but the effect of clozapine remains largely unknown. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of clozapine on naturalistic outcomes in patients with intellectual disability. By combining the national health registers , we identified all patients in Denmark with intellectual disability initiating clozapine treatment during the period 1996-2012. We used a mirror-image model to test whether initiation of clozapine treatment was associated with reduction in psychiatric admissions and inpatient days , reduction in the number of individuals performing intentional self-harm or overdose , and less frequent use of concomitant psychopharmacological treatment. Similar outcome measures were used in a reverse mirror-image model to investigate the effects of clozapine termination. A total of 405 patients with intellectual disability redeemed clozapine. After initiation of clozapine the number of psychiatric admissions were reduced by 0.65 admissions ( 95 % CI: 0.31-1.00) and the inpatient days were reduced by 67.2 days ( 95 % CI: 51.2-83.3) , with a similar decrease for patients with intellectual disability without psychiatric comorbidity. Clozapine treatment was not found to reduce the number of individuals with intentional self-harm , incidents of overdose , or the use of concomitant psychotropics. In cases where clozapine treatment was terminated , the number of psychiatric admissions increased by 0.57 admissions ( 95 % CI: 0.01-1.12). This nationwide study , which is the largest to date , suggests that treatment with clozapine is associated with a reduction in psychiatric admissions and inpatient days in patients with intellectual disability. Further studies evaluating the effects of clozapine in patients with intellectual disability are warranted.
