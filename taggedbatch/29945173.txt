 The bacterial cytoplasm is not a homogeneous solution of macromolecules , but rather a highly organized and compartmentalized space where the clustering and segregation of macromolecular complexes in certain cell regions confers functional efficiency. Bacterial chemoreceptors represent a versatile model system to study the subcellular localization of macromolecules , as they are present in almost all motile bacterial and archaeal species , where they tend to form highly ordered arrays that occupy distinct positions in cells. The positioning of chemoreceptor clusters , as well as their segregation mechanism on cell division , varies from species to species and probably depends on cells size , environment and speed of movement. In this review , we summarize the current understanding of the architecture and the segregation mechanisms of chemoreceptors in a limited number of bacterial model systems and suggest that the pattern of chemoreceptor distribution is coupled to behavioral life-style of that species.
