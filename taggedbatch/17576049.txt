 The life quality of patients with epileptic<symptom> seizures<symptom> is highly affected by cognitive deficits. Low Frequency Stimulation ( LFS) is a novel approach for the treatment of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. The main goal of this research is investigating the possible effect of LFS on seizure-induced cognitive dysfunction. To this end , the kindled animal were prepared via CA1 electrical stimulation in a semi-rapid way ( 12 stimulations/day). A group of animals were stimulated with LFS , 4 times at 30 s , 6 h , 24 h , and 30 h after the last kindling stimulation. Applied LFS was administered in 4 packages every 5 minutes. The packages were designed with 200 monophasic 200 monophasic square wave pulses of 0.1 ms duration at 1 Hz. The passive-avoidance test was conducted on all animals in order to measure the learning and memory<symptom> behavior<symptom>. Hippocampal kindled rats showed deficits in learning and memory when passive avoidance test was performed. Application of LFS reversed the impairment in learning and memory<symptom> behavior<symptom> in kindled rats. At the same time , LFS markedly diminished kindling-induced neuronal loss and atrophy in the hippocampus. LFS may have some protection against seizure-induced cognitive damage in kindled rats.
