 The present study examined differences in social criticism and maternal distress and in household , maternal , and infant characteristics between families who co-slept with their infants beyond 6 months and those who moved their infants to a separate room by 6 months. Data for infant sleeping arrangements , preferences for their sleeping arrangement choices , criticism , depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms , and worries about infant sleep were collected from 103 European American mothers during the infant 's first year. Mothers who co-slept with their infants beyond 6 months ( persistent co-sleepers) were more likely than mothers who moved their infants to solitary sleep by 6 months to receive criticism and report depression<symptom> and worry about infants ' sleep behavior , even after controlling for preference for the sleep arrangement they used. Interestingly , criticism was associated with maternal depression<symptom> and worries only for persistent co-sleeping mothers. Further , these mothers had lower income , reported greater space constraints , were younger , single , or unemployed , less likely to have a Bachelor 's degree , and more likely to have infants with greater negative affectivity or problematic night waking , compared to mothers of solitary sleeping infants. Adherence to cultural norms regarding infant sleeping arrangements may be a strong predictor of social criticism and maternal well-being.
