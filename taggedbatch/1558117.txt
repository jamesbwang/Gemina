 We describe the benefits of perfluoro-N-octane ( PFO) , a perfluorocarbon liquid , in the removal of nonmagnetic intraocular foreign bodies ( IOFBs) from the macula and posterior segment. Two consecutive cases of posterior segment IOFB were reviewed. An 18-year-old male presented to the emergency room after a motor vehicle accident with a zone 1 open globe injury and large glass IOFB in the left eye. A 53-year-old male presented to the emergency room with a history of a 3-week delayed presentation of a zone 1 open globe injury from a nail to the right eye. He was found to have a metallic IOFB. In both cases , PFO was used to slide the nonmagnetic IOFBs outside of the macula for safer retrieval. PFO was also able to protect the posterior pole from IOFB drops during early attempts at removal. PFO can be a useful surgical adjunct to pars plana vitrectomy in the removal of certain nonmagnetic IOFBs.
