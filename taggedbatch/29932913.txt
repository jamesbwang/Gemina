 We reported recently that the Parkinsonism-associated protein DJ-1 and its bacterial homologs Hsp31 , YhbO and YajL function as deglycases that repair proteins and nucleotides from endogeneous glycation by glyoxal and methylglyoxal , two reactive by-products of glucose metabolism responsible for up to 60 % of glycation damage. Here , we show that DJ-1 , deglycase 1 and deglycase 2 repair glyoxal- and methylglyoxal-glycated substrates , whereas deglycase 3 principally repairs glyoxal-glycated substrates. Moreover , deglycase 1 and 2 are overexpressed in stationary phase , whereas deglycase 3 is steadily expressed throughout bacterial growth. Finally , deglycase mutants overexpress glyoxalases , aldoketoreductases , glutathione-S-transferase and efflux pumps to alleviate carbonyl stress. In the discussion , we present an overview of the multiple functions of DJ-1 proteins. Our thourough work on deglycases provides compelling evidence that their previously reported glyoxalase III activity merely reflects their deglycase activity. Moreover , for their deglycase activity the Maillard deglycases likely recruit: i) their chaperone activity to interact with glycated proteins , ii) glyoxalase 1 activity to catalyze the rearrangement of Maillard products ( aminocarbinols and hemithioacetals) into amides and thioesters , respectively , iii) their protease activity to cleave amide bonds of glycated arginine , lysine and guanine , and iv) glyoxalase 2 activity to cleave thioester bonds of glycated cysteine. Finally , because glycation affects many cellular processes , the discovery of the Maillard deglycases , awaited since 1912 , likely constitutes a major advance for medical research , including ageing , cancer , atherosclerosis , neurodegenerative , post-diabetic , renal and autoimmune diseases.
