 Odontogenic keratocysts have been reported with high recurrence rates in the literature so various treatment modalities from simple enucleation to resection have been performed to achieve the cure. The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the recurrence rate of odontogenic keratocysts ( OKCs) treated by enucleation and peripheral ostectomy. An electronic search of the database of the Hacettepe University , Faculty of Medicine , Department of Pathology , was undertaken to identify patients histologically diagnosed with OKCs treated at Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery between 2001 and 2015. In total , 81 patients were studied. The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 42 years , and the male: female ratio was 1:0.7. OKCs were located primarily in the posterior mandibular region ( 41 %). Twenty-seven patients were re-examined to determine the recurrence rate. The mean follow-up period was 5 years ( range , 1-12 years). The recurrence rate was 14.8 %. The relationship between location of the lesion<symptom> and recurrence was not statistically significant ( p = 0.559). There was also no statistically significant relation between the recurrence rate and treatment option of teeth involved in the lesion<symptom> ( p = 0.579). The authors conclude that treatment of OKCs by enucleation with peripheral ostectomy is associated with minimal morbidity and is preferred over other aggressive treatment modalities. Meticulous radiographic examination and careful surgical resection may decrease the recurrence rate of OKCs.
