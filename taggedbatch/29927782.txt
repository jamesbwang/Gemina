 Cryoablation is an indicated therapy for the treatment of recurrent atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> through pulmonary vein isolation; however , the optimal time between first diagnosis of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> and cryoablation is still unknown. We aimed to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of early versus later treatment of patients with paroxysmal atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> by cryoablation. Five hundred and ten patients underwent atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> cryoablation and were prospectively followed for at least 6 months in 43 Italian cardiology centers. The population was divided into two groups according to the time since the first diagnosis of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> until the index cryoablation procedure. An early-treatment group had an elapsed time of 15 months or less from atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> diagnosis until cryoablation , and the late-treatment group had an elapsed time of greater than 15 months. During the evaluation , clinical efficacy was defined as atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> recurrence outside a landmark 90-day blanking period , and safety was defined as the reporting of all procedure-related complications. In the total cohort , cryoablation was performed after a median of 36 months from the point of the patient diagnosis with drug refractory symptomatic recurrent atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>. The early-treatment group was composed of 130 ( 25 %) patients , whereas the late-treatment group had 380 ( 75 %) patients. Both cohorts had similar baseline clinical characteristics. Of 510 patients , 22 had a complication related to the procedure with no difference between the two groups. Multivariable analysis showed that the risk of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> recurrence was significantly higher in the late-treatment group ( hazard ratio: 1.77; 95 % confidence interval 1.00-3.13) CONCLUSION: In our multicenter observational examination , cryoablation was well tolerated and effective in the treatment of patients with drug refractory symptomatic paroxysmal atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>. Reducing the time between diagnosis and ablation brought about a treatment that had a lower risk of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> recurrence with no change in safety.
