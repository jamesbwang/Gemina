 The objective of this study was to investigate the co-occurrence of biofilms and quinolone resistance in Salmonella<pathogen> enterica<pathogen> serotype Typhimurium<pathogen> mediated by IncHI2-type oqxAB-positive plasmids. Among the 40 Salmonella<pathogen><disease> strains , we found that 27 isolates formed biofilms and displayed identical multidrug-resistance profiles to ciprofloxacin , doxycycline , sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim , ampicillin and streptomycin , based on biofilm formation assays and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. In particular , a single S.<pathogen> Typhimurium<pathogen> isolate named SC523 produced the thickest biofilms and exhibited the highest-level resistance ( MIC = 8 μg/mL) to ciprofloxacin compared to those of the other isolates. The detection of known plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance ( PMQR) genes and point mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region ( QRDR) by PCR assay showed that oqxAB genes were present in 27 biofilm-positive isolates. Conjugation experiments , S1-pulse-field gel electrophoresis and biofilm formation assays demonstrated that the conjugative plasmid that encoded biofilms and quinolone resistance in Salmonella SC523 could be transferred to a recipient with a frequency of 4.7 × 10
