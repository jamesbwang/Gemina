 Extrathyroidal extension ( ETE) is a risk factor for poor papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC) outcomes. However , the clinical significance of ETE according to primary tumor size has not been well-established. The purpose of this study was to compare differences in clinical outcomes , according to the presence and extent of ETE , between different primary tumor size groups. In total , 381 patients with PTC underwent total thyroidectomy with or without lymph node ( LN) dissection from 2004 to 2010. We divided the patients into two groups according to primary tumor size: â‰¤ 1 cm or > 1 cm. Each group was further divided into subgroups according to the presence of ETE ( ETE vs. no ETE) and degree of ETE ( microscopic ETE vs. macroscopic ETE). The clinicopathological features and rate of recurrence during follow-up were compared among groups. Among the PTC patients with primary tumors > 1 cm , patients with ETE had a higher recurrence rate than those without ETE , and only macroscopic ETE affected recurrence in patients with PTC > 1 cm ( P < 0.05). However , there was no significant difference in recurrence rates between those without ETE and those with microscopic ETE ( P = 0.100). When the primary tumor size was less than 1 cm , there were no difference in recurrence rates between the groups with or without ETE , or between the groups with microscopic and macroscopic ETE ( P > 0.05). Our data suggests that the presence and degree of ETE may be associated with PTC outcome based on primary tumor size.
