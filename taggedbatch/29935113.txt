 Although it is known that glucose concentration exhibits a time-dependent decay in uncentrifuged serum and lithium-heparin blood tubes , no evidence exists on how this variation may depend on blood cell counts ( CBC) and volumes. Venous blood was drawn from 30 non fasting healthy volunteers into three serum and three lithium-heparin tubes. One serum and lithium-heparin tubes were centrifuged within 15 min after collection and glucose was measured with a hexokinase assay. The second and third serum and lithium-heparin tubes were maintained at room temperature for 1 and 2 h after the first tubes were centrifuged. These other tubes were then centrifuged and glucose was measured. CBC was performed in the first lithium-heparin tube , before centrifugation. The mean decrease of glucose was higher in lithium-heparin plasma than in serum ( 0.33 vs. 0.24 mmol/L/h; p < 0.001). Glucose concentration decreased by 7 % and 5 % per hour in lithium-heparin plasma and serum , respectively. In univariate analysis , the absolute decrease of glucose concentration was associated with sex ( higher in men than in women) , red blood cell ( RBC) count , hematocrit , white blood cell ( WBC) count , neutrophils and monocytes in both lithium-heparin plasma and serum. In multivariate analysis , the decrease of glucose concentration remained independently associated with RBC , WBC , neutrophils and monocytes in both sample matrices. No significant association was found with platelet number and erythrocyte or platelet volume. Glucose concentration decrease in uncentrifuged lithium-heparin and serum tubes depends on the baseline number of RBC , WBC , neutrophils and monocytes within the tubes.
