 The response to cancer immune therapy is dependent on endogenous tumor reactive T cells. To bypass this requirement , CD3-bispecific antibodies have been developed to induce a polyclonal T cell response against the tumor. Anti-HER2/ CD3 T cell-dependent bispecific ( TDB) antibody is highly efficacious in the treatment of HER2 over-expressing tumors in mice. Efficacy and immunological effects of anti-HER2/ CD3 TDB were investigated in a mammary tumor model with very few T cells prior treatment. We further describe the mechanism for TDB-induced T cell recruitment to tumors. Immunological effects and mechanism of CD3-bispecific antibody-induced T cell recruitment into spontaneous HER2 over-expressing mammary tumors was studied using human HER2 transgenic , immune-competent mouse models. Anti-HER2/ CD3 TDB treatment induced an inflammatory response in tumors converting them from poorly infiltrated to an inflamed , T cell abundant , phenotype. Multiple mechanisms accounted for the TDB-induced increase in T cells within tumors. TDB treatment induced CD8 In summary , we demonstrate that the activity of anti-HER2/ CD3 TDB was not dependent on high level baseline T cell infiltration. Our results suggest that anti-HER2/ CD3 TDB may be efficacious in patients and indications that respond poorly to checkpoint inhibitors. An active T cell recruitment mediated by TDB-induced chemokine signaling was the major mechanism for T cell recruitment.
