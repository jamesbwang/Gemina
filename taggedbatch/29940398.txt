 Using `` theory of mind '' to successfully accommodate differing perspectives during communication requires much more than just acquiring basic theory of mind understanding. Evidence suggests that children 's ability to adopt a speaker 's perspective continues to develop throughout childhood to adolescence until adulthood. The current study examined the cognitive factors that could account for variations in children 's abilities to use a speaker 's perspective during language comprehension and whether the same factors contribute to age-related improvements. Our study incorporated into a commonly used communication task two types of memory demands that are frequently present in our everyday communication but have been overlooked in the previous literature: remembering a speaker 's perspective and the amount of common ground information. Findings from two experiments demonstrated that both 8- and 10-year-olds committed more egocentric errors when each of these memory demands was high. Our study also found some supporting evidence for the age-related improvement in children 's perspective use , with 10-year-olds generally committing fewer egocentric errors compared with 8-year-olds. Interestingly , there was no clear evidence that the memory factors that affected children 's perspective use in our experiments were also the factors that drove age-related improvement.
