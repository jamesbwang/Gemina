 Thyroid disorders are clinically associated with impaired fertility in women , and these abnormalities can be improved by restoring the euthyroid state. The exact mechanisms of thyroid effect on female fertility are not well known; however , it is conceivable that thyroid hormones ( THs) might act on ovarian physiology via receptors in granulosa<pathogen> cells. This work is aimed at evaluating the effects of THs on non-tumoral granulosa<pathogen> cells and follicles. Freshly isolated rat ovarian follicles and granulosa<pathogen> cells were exposed to T3 or T4 ( THs). Cell growth and viability were evaluated by cell counting and the MTT assay , respectively , follicle growth was evaluated by volume measurements. Apoptosis was evaluated by the TUNEL assay and active Caspase 3 staining. rGROV cells were exposed to T3 , and apoptosis was induced by serum deprivation. Bcl2 , Bcl-2-associated X protein ( BAX) , Akt and pAkt expression were evaluated by western blot. T3 induced a 40 % increase in follicle volume ( after 7 days). This increase was presumably due to the observed decrease ( 33 %) in the apoptotic rate of the granulosa<pathogen> cell population. Both T3 and T4 caused a dose-dependent increase in rat granulosa<pathogen> cell number and viability. In addition , THs decreased the cell apoptotic rate in a dose-dependent manner. In both conditions , T3 appeared to be more efficient. In rGROV cells , 100 nM T3 induced cell growth and , in the absence of growth factors , reduced cell apoptosis by 40 % , downregulating Caspase 3 and BAX. This effect was associated with an increase in pAkt levels. The involvement of the PI3 K pathway was confirmed by the ability of the PI3 K specific inhibitor ( LY-294,002) to abolish T3 pro-survival action. THs influence cell survival of ovarian granulosa<pathogen> cells. This effect likely contributes to the TH-induced follicle volume increase.
