 Postoperative delirium<symptom> is a common complication associated with increased morbidity and mortality. A recently-reported association between intraoperative electroencephalogram suppression and postoperative delirium<symptom> might be mediated in some patients by a heightened sensitivity to volatile anaesthetics. This retrospective cohort study included 618 elective surgery patients with planned intensive care unit admission , who also received intraoperative electroencephalogram monitoring and had delirium<symptom> assessments documented in the medical record. Sensitivity to volatile anaesthetics was assessed using a mixed effects model predicting the likelihood of electroencephalogram suppression at each time point based on the current end-tidal anaesthetic concentration. Patients with a random intercept above the population median ( electroencephalogram suppression at lower anaesthetic concentrations) were classified as having heightened sensitivity to volatile anaesthetics. Delirium<symptom> was defined as a positive Confusion<symptom> Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit assessment anytime in the first five postoperative days. Postoperative delirium<symptom> was observed in 162 of 618 patients ( 26 %). Patients who experienced electroencephalogram suppression at lower volatile anaesthetic concentrations had a higher incidence of postoperative delirium<symptom> ( 109/309 ( 35 %)) than other patients ( 53/309 ( 17 %)) ( unadjusted odds ratio 2.63; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.81-3.84 , P < 0.001). This association remained significant after adjusting for patient characteristics , surgical variables , and duration of electroencephalogram suppression ( adjusted odds ratio 2.13; 95 % CI 1.24-3.65 , P = 0.006). These data support the hypothesis that patients with electroencephalogram suppression at lower volatile anaesthetic concentrations have an increased incidence of postoperative delirium<symptom>. Such patients appear to exhibit a phenotype of anaesthetic sensitivity , which might predispose them to adverse cognitive outcomes.
