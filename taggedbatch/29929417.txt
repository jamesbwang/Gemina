 Despite the progress made by the scientific exercise community in collaborating and communicating with nonscientist coaches , there is room for improvement. Coaches find research difficult to understand , feel that their interests are not being addressed by exercise research , and rely on peer discussion to further their coaching knowledge base while consuming few peer-reviewed articles. One useful strategy to bridge the science-practice gap is with case studies. In addition to furthering our understanding of the physiology , psychology , and training schedules of elite athletes , case studies can serve ( 1) as a useful communication channel with coaches if presented as narratives and ( 2) to establish and strengthen relationships between scientists and coaches , leading to fruitful research collaborations. The purpose of this invited commentary is to discuss these 2 less-recognized benefits of case studies and propose a way to incorporate case studies more frequently alongside group-based studies.
