 This qualitative study explored the perception of good and bad death among 15 social workers serving in elderly care facilities in Korea. A good death involved dying peacefully without much suffering , dying with family members present , death following a good life , and believing in a better afterlife. A bad death involved burdening children in the dying process , dying after extensive illness , dying isolated from family , and death from suicide. To ensure a good death and avoid a bad death for elders , social workers are encouraged to closely engage with not only elders but also their families.
