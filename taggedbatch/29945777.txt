 A 15-year-old Warmblood mare , at 8 months of gestation , was presented to the Ghent University Faculty of Veterinary Medicine for evaluation of suspected stage one labor. Transrectal ultrasonography revealed no clear signs of placentitis or stage one labor. The combined thickness of uterus and placenta was 11 mm and the cervix was closed. Twin pregnancy was suspected by transabdominal ultrasonography but could not be confirmed with certainty. An electrocardiogram ( ECG) was recorded from the mare 's abdominal wall to register a fetal ECG. To confirm twin pregnancy , registration of both fetal ECGs simultaneously on the same ECG trace was attempted. Twelve different electrode configurations were used. In 11 recordings , one fetal ECG was visible. Only one specific right-sided electrode configuration showed both fetal ECGs at the same time , which confirmed twin pregnancy. Although electrocardiographic diagnosis of a twin pregnancy in a mare is possible , this case highlights the need for multiple electrode configurations and the high likelihood of false negatives.
