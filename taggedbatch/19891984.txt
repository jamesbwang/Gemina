 The aim of the study is to analyze the mediating effect of self-esteem on the relationship between perceived discrimination and psychological well-being in South American immigrants in Chile. An analytical , cross sectional , non-experimental design was used. We evaluated 853 Peruvians and Colombians living in the northern cities of Arica , Antofagasta , and Santiago de Chile , the capital located in the center of the country. The instruments used were the Ryff Psychological Well-being Scale , the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Perceived Discrimination Scale by Basabe , Paez , Aierdi and Jim√©nez-Aristizabal. We used the estimation method ( RWLS) and polychoric correlation matrices , to estimate the effect size and overall fit of the direct effect models of discrimination and self-esteem on psychological well-being , and indirect and total effects of discrimination mediated by self-esteem. While both populations reported similar levels of perceived discrimination , it was found that the means in psychological well-being and self-esteem of the Colombian population were significantly higher than that of the Peruvian population. Regarding self-esteem , the results provided evidence for the possible mediating effect on the relationship between perceived discrimination and psychological well-being. This research aims to contribute to the development of interventions seeking to strengthen self-esteem in order to circumvent possible negative consequences of perceived discrimination , as a consequent , improving immigrants ' personal resources to successfully cope with the diverse demands of their new context.
