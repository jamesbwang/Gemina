 The spectrum of injury associated with anterior abdominal stab wounds<disease><symptom> ( SWs) is well established. The literature in the specific setting of isolated omental evisceration is limited. We reviewed our experience of 244 consecutive patients with established indications for laparotomy over an eight year period at a major trauma centre in South Africa. Of the 244 patients ( 93 % male , mean age: 27 years) , 224 ( 92) underwent immediate laparotomy ( IL). Twenty were initially observed and eventually required a laparotomy ( delayed laparotomy , DL). The mean time from injury to decision for laparotomy was < 3 h in 92 % ( 224/244) , < 6 h in 6 % ( 14/244) , < 12 h 2 % ( 4/244) and < 18 h in 1 % ( 2/244). Ninety-eight per cent ( 238/244) of laparotomies were positive and 96 % of the positive laparotomies ( 229/238) were considered therapeutic. The mostly commonly injured organ encountered on laparotomy were small bowel , stomach and colon. The most commonly injures encountered are intestinal and gastric. Clinicians must remain vigilant as injuries may be subtle.
