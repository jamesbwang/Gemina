 The use of novel methods to characterize living tumor cells relies on well-conceived biobanks. Herein , we raised the question of whether the composition of fresh and freeze/thawed dissociated tumor samples is comparable in terms of quantitative and qualitative profiling. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease , encompassing luminal A and B , basal/triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC) , and ERBB2-like tumors. We examined living cells dissociated from TNBC and found that a classical freeze/thaw protocol leads to a marked reduction in the number of CD45
