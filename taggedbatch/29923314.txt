 RPR 102681 , a cholecystokinin-B antagonist , increased dopamine ( DA) release and reduced cocaine self-administration in animals. This pilot study sought to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics ( PK) of co-administration of RPR 102681 and cocaine , and to confirm the DA release mechanism of RPR 102681. Sixteen cocaine-dependent participants were randomized to either placebo or RPR102681 at 3 ascending doses; cocaine was co-administered at steady state of RPR 102681. ( RPR 102681 was well tolerated , and safe to co-administer with cocaine. RPR 102681 did not alter the PK of either cocaine or its metabolite benzoylecgonine and showed no intrinsic abuse liability. There was a trend toward reduction of cocaine craving scores. In contrast to animal studies , RPR 102681 significantly increased the binding potential of ( Overall , this pilot study suggests that RPR 102681 would be unlikely candidate , as an agonist medication for the treatment for cocaine addiction but worth investigating further for possible role in reducing craving.
