 In tumor patients , programmed cell death-1 ( PD-1) can inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation by binding to its ligand , thereby promote tumor immune escape. A large number of experiments showed that PD-L1 molecule highly expressed on lymphoma cells , while PD-1 expression was up-regulated in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes , suggesting its role in the development of lymphoma , which may be an important therapeutic target for lymphoma. PD-1 and PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies can block the PD-1/ PD-Ls signaling pathway , restore T cell function , thus inhibit the tumor growth. At present , a number of early clinical trials have demonstrated the significant efficacy and less side effects in various subtypes of recurrent lymphoma , which will be promising therapeutic agents. In this review , the mechanism of PD-1/ PD-L1 signal pathway , the expression of PD-1/ PD-L1 in lymphoma and the anti-tumor effect of its antibody in lymphoma are summarized.
