 Chloroplasts are the characteristic endosymbiotic organelles of plant cells which during the course of evolution lost most of their genetic information to the nucleus. Thus , they critically depend on the host cell for allocation of nearly their complete protein supply. This includes gene expression , translation , protein targeting , and transport-all of which need to be tightly regulated and perfectly coordinated to accommodate the cells ' needs. To this end , multiple signaling pathways have been implemented that interchange information between the different cellular compartments. One of the most complex and energy consuming processes is the translocation of chloroplast-destined proteins into their target organelle. It is a concerted effort from chaperones , receptor proteins , channels , and regulatory elements to ensure correct targeting , efficient transport , and subsequent folding. Although we have discovered and learned a lot about protein import into chloroplasts in the last decades , there are still many open questions and debates about the roles of individual proteins as well as the mechanistic details. In this review , I will summarize and discuss the published data with a focus on the translocation complex in the chloroplast inner envelope membrane.
