 Fatigue<symptom> modifies the kinematics of various sports-related movements. Basketball induces fatigue<symptom> , however , the effects of fatigue<symptom> on the kinematics of shooting have never been studied. This study analysed the effects of fatigue<symptom> induced by repeated sprints on the kinematics of 3-point shooting ( 3PS) in young , elite basketball players ( U18 level). 3D joint angles were calculated at the maximum and minimum heights of the centre of mass during 3PS , using inertial measurement units ( Biomech system , Xsens Technologies BV , Enschede , The Netherlands). Height , velocity and the angle of the ball at the time of release were extrapolated from the wrist joint angles. All players performed four 3PS actions in dynamic conditions before and after a fatigue<symptom> protocol at 70 % of their maximal exercise capacity. The fatigue<symptom> protocol consisted of a shuttle test with repeated 20-m sprints interspersed with sets of 5 jumps. There was no change in the kinematics of 3PS ( p > 0.05) , or the ball release variables ( p > 0.05) following the fatigue<symptom> protocol. This suggests that elite basketball players are able to cope with physical fatigue<symptom> while performing coordinated movements such as 3PS.
