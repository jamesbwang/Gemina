 GWIPS-viz is a publicly available browser that provides Genome Wide Information on Protein Synthesis through the visualization of ribosome profiling data. Ribosome profiling ( Ribo-seq) is a high-throughput technique which isolates fragments of messenger RNA that are protected by the ribosome. The alignment of the ribosome-protected fragments or footprint sequences to the corresponding reference genome and their visualization using GWIPS-viz allows for unique insights into the genome loci that are expressed as potentially translated RNA. The GWIPS-viz browser hosts both Ribo-seq data and corresponding mRNA-seq data from publicly available studies across a number of genomes , avoiding the need for computational processing on the user side. Since its initial publication in 2014 , over 1885 tracks have been produced across 24 genomes. This unit describes the navigation of the GWIPS-viz genome browser , the uploading of custom tracks , and the downloading of the Ribo-seq/mRNA-seq alignment data. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
