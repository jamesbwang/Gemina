 The human salivary gland ( HSG) cell line , labeled as a submandibular ductal cell line , is commonly used as in vitro models to study radiation therapy , Sj√∂gren 's syndrome<disease><symptom> , pleomorphic adenoma , mucocele , epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition , and epigenetics. However , the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC) has recently released a list of cross-contaminated cell lines that included HSG. Despite this notice , some research laboratories still use HSG as a salivary cell model. Therefore , this study examined the authenticity of HSG sampled from three different laboratories. DNA was extracted from HSG and additional salivary cell lines ( NS-SV-AC , NS-SV-DC , A253 , HSY) and submitted for cell line authentication with short tandem repeat ( STR) analysis. All HSG samples had STR profiles indicating > 80 % match with HeLa in both the ATCC and Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen ( DSMZ) databases. This confirmed that HSG sampled from three different laboratories and HSY shared a common ancestry ( host) with HeLa , whereas NS-SV-AC , NS-SV-DC , and A253 had unique STR profiles. Short tandem repeat analysis revealed that HSG was contaminated by the HeLa cell line. Furthermore , because genotyping of the original HSG cell line was not performed during its establishment , it will be difficult to authenticate an uncontaminated sample of HSG.
