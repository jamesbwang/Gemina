 The carcinoembryonic antigen level in peritoneal lavage has been showing to be a reliable prognostic factor in gastric cancer. To identify any association between carcinoembryonic antigen level in peritoneal lavage , in gastric cancer patients , with mortality , peritoneal recurrence , tumor relapse or other prognostic factors. In total , 30 patients ( 22 men , 8 women; median age 66 years) with resectable gastric cancer ( mainly stage III and IV) were studied. Carcinoembryonic antigen level in peritoneal lavage was detected at operation by immunocytochemical method and a level over 210 ng/g of protein was considered as positive. There were detected 10 positive cases ( 33.3 %) of plCEA levels. These levels were associated with mortality , RR: 2.1 ( p = 0.018); peritoneal recurrence , OR: 9.0 ( p = 0.015); and relapse or gastric cancer progression , OR: 27.0 ( p = 0.001). Increased levels of plCEA fairly predicts mortality , peritoneal recurrence tumor relapse or cancer progression.
