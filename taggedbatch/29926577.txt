 Subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> is a neurovascular emergency affecting relatively young adults. A ruptured cerebral aneurysm<disease> is the main non-traumatic cause. Except for the non-specific symptom of headache<symptom> , which frequently occurs in subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> , the clinical presentation is atypical , making the diagnosis difficult with possible dramatic consequences. The diagnosis is based on the CT scan without contrast , which , when negative , will be followed by a lumbar puncture. The etiologic analysis is based on an urgent arteriography , revealing the characteristics of the aneurysm<disease> such as the anatomy of the intracerebral vessels , the identification of the bleeding site and the size and location of the aneurysm<disease>. The main complications are bleeding relapse , hydrocephaly and vasospasm. Early treatment is based on the final repair of the aneurysm<disease> through two possible approaches: microvascular neurosurgical clipping or coiling via endovascular access. This article discusses the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom>.
