 Acute myocardial infarction ( MI) invokes a large inflammatory response which contributes to myocardial repair. We investigated whether C-reactive protein ( CRP) measured during MI versus at 1 month follow-up improves the prediction of left ventricular ( LV) function. We prospectively enrolled 131 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction and without non-cardiovascular causes of inflammation<symptom>. We correlated admission and peak levels of CRP during hospitalization and high-sensitivity ( hs) CRP at 1 month follow-up with markers of cardiac injury. Clinical follow-up and echocardiography for LV function were performed at a mean of 17 months. Median CRP levels were 1.89 mg/L on admission with MI , peaked to 12.10 mg/L during hospitalization and dropped to 1.24 mg/L at 1 month. Although admission CRP levels only weakly correlated with ejection fraction in the acute phase of MI ( coefficient -0.164 , p = 0.094) , peak CRP was significantly related to ejection fraction ( coefficient -0.4 , p < 0.001) , hsTroponin T ( 0.389 , p < 0.001) and white blood cell count ( 0.389 , p < 0.001). hsCRP at 1 month was not related to the extent of acute cardiac injury. These findings were replicated in an independent cohort of 57 patients. Peak CRP predicted LV dysfunction at follow-up ( OR 11.0 , 3.1-39.5 per log CRP , p < 0.001) , persisting after adjustment for infarct size ( OR 5.1 , 1.1-23.6 , p = 0.037) , while hsCRP at 1 month was unrelated to LV function at follow-up. hsCRP 1 month post-MI does not relate to acute cardiac injury or LV function at follow-up , but we confirm that peak CRP is an independent predictor of LV dysfunction at follow-up.
