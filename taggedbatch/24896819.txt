 Metagenomic sequencing of patient samples is a very promising method for the diagnosis of human<disease> infections<disease>. Sequencing has the ability to capture all the DNA or RNA from pathogenic organisms in a human sample. However , complete and accurate characterization of the sequence , including identification of any pathogens , depends on the availability and quality of genomes for comparison. Thousands of genomes are now available , and as these numbers grow , the power of metagenomic sequencing for diagnosis should increase. However , recent studies have exposed the presence of contamination in published genomes , which when used for diagnosis increases the risk of falsely identifying the wrong pathogen. To address this problem , we have developed a bioinformatics system for eliminating contamination as well as low-complexity genomic sequences in the draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. We applied this software to identify and remove human , bacterial , archaeal , and viral sequences present in a comprehensive database of all sequenced eukaryotic pathogen genomes. We also removed low-complexity genomic sequences , another source of false positives. Using this pipeline , we have produced a database of `` clean '' eukaryotic pathogen genomes for use with bioinformatics classification and analysis tools. We demonstrate that when attempting to find eukaryotic pathogens in metagenomic samples , the new database provides better sensitivity than one using the original genomes while offering a dramatic reduction in false positives.
