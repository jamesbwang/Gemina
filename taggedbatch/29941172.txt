 Estrogen-related receptor γ ( ERRγ) and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 ( HSD17B1) have important roles in cell invasion and in the proliferation of many types of cancer cells. However , it remains unknown whether ERRγ and HSD17B1 contribute to abnormal placental structure and dysfunction which characterize fetal growth restriction ( FGR). Therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate the expression profiles of ERRγ and HSD17B1 in placenta tissues affected by FGR and to examine a possible molecular mechanism by which ERRγ is able to regulate HSD17B1 during development of FGR. Placenta tissues were collected from women affected by FGR ( n = 28) and from women with appropriately gestational age ( AGA) ( n = 30). Relative mRNA and protein levels of ERRγ and HSD17B1 in both groups were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR , immunohistochemistry , and Western blot analyses. The effect of ERRγ on trophoblast function and its associated mechanistic details were studied in the trophoblast cell line , HTR-8/ SVneo , which was transfected with small interfering RNA ( siRNA) targeting ERRγ. Both mRNA and protein levels of ERRγ and HSD17B1 were significantly lower in FGR placentae ( P < 0.05). When ERRγ expression was knocked down in HTR-8/ SVneo cells with siRNA , invasion and proliferation were inhibited. In addition , HSD17B1 expression was significantly decreased. In dual luciferase reporter assays , ERRγ stimulated transcription of HSD17B1 by targeting the ERRγ response element within its 5 '- flanking promoter region. Aberrant ERRγ expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of FGR by regulating the transcriptional activity of HSD17B1.
