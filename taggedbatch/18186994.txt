 It has been known that anesthetic adjuvants such as dexamethasone or ketamine might change mood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a single dose of each drug individually along with their combined usage on postoperative mood changes in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery. Two hundred ninety-seven patients randomly allocated were divided into three groups. Group K ( n = 99) received a single dose of ketamine ( 0.5 mg/kg iv); group D ( n = 99) received a single dose of dexamethasone ( 0.1 mg/kg iv) , and group KD ( n = 99) received both ketamine ( 0.5 mg/kg iv) and dexamethasone ( 0.1 mg/kg iv) at 5 min after the induction of anesthesia. A change in the patient health questionnaire ( PHQ) -9 scores on the first and third day after surgery , the duration of anesthesia , the postoperative visual analog scale ( VAS) for pain , and the patient controlled analgesia ( PCA) consumption were evaluated. Groups K and KD showed a significant reduction in PHQ-9 score on both the first and third day after surgery compared with those recorded preoperatively and in group D ( P < 0.01). There were no differences in the group D PHQ-9 scores pre- and post-operatively. The VAS for pain 24 h after surgery and the PCA consumption in group KD decreased significantly compared to the other two groups ( P < 0.05). A single dose of ketamine ( 0.5 mg/kg) with or without combination with dexamethasone ( 0.1 mg/kg) give iv 5 min after induction of general anesthetic produced significant improvement in the postoperative mood scores. A single intravenous dose of dexamethasone ( 0.1 mg/kg) alone did not change postoperative mood scores. The VAS for pain 24 h after surgery and the PCA consumption was significantly lower in patients who received combination of both drugs.
