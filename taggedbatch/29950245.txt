 Some patients diagnosed as immune thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( ITP) have poor<symptom> response<symptom> to common first-line therapy such as corticosteroid and immunoglobulin. Studies in recent years have found a FC-independent platelet clearance pathway exists , which is characterized by desialylation of platelet surface glycoprotein ( GP) , recognition and phagocytosis by Ashwell-Morell receptor ( AMR) on hepatocytes , independent on Fc receptors of the reticuloendothelial system. The up-regulation of neuraminidase-1 ( Neu1) expression on platelet caused by various factors , such as cold storage of platelet , septicemia<disease><symptom> and ITP could desialylate GPs. It has been found that ITP with positive anti-GPIbα antibody mostly has a poor<symptom> response<symptom> to first-line therapy and indicated that such antibody may lead to FC-independent platelet clearance. It also has been proved that anti-GPIbα antibody could desialylate GPs on platelet in animal experiments. Researchers have tris to use sialidase inhibitor agent to treat ITP and got a persistent response of platelet. Here , the desialylation of platelet and its role in ITP pathogensis and therapy are reviewed.
