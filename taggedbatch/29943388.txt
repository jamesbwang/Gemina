 Electrocatalysts with high efficiency and durability for hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER) hold tremendous promise for next-generation energy conversion. Among the state-of-art catalysts for HER , organic-inorganic hybrid nanosheets exhibit great potential with the merit of high activity , good durability and low cost. Nevertheless , there is rarely a general method for the synthesis of binary metal phosphides hybrid HER catalysts with tunable morphology and composition. Herein we report a facile approach to synthesize compositional binary cobalt nickel phosphides hybrid nanosheets with hierarchical porous nanostructures using an oxidation-phosphorization process. The as-optimized hybrid nanosheets annealed at 350 oC yields the highest pH-universal activity with overpotentials of 148 mV , 111 mV and 173 mV in acidic , alkaline and neutral medium , respectively. Besides the promoted mass diffusion in hierarchically porous structure , the extraordinary performance can be also attributed to weakened adsorption of hydrogen as a result of tunable composition of Co and Ni , which can be revealed by the first-principle calculations.
