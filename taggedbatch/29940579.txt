 Interference refers to learned associations and established behaviors `` interfering '' with response to new material. It forms a core pillar of executive functions , which are commonly affected in Parkinson 's disease ( PD). Cognitive interference test ( CIT) forms part of a smartphone application designed for ambulatory assessment in PD. The aims of this study were to establish that CIT could effectively demonstrate interference and would perform comparably to the Stroop Color-Word Test Victoria version ( VST) despite PD-related motor impairment. Ninety-nine patients with PD were recruited. Initial evaluation included CIT , VST , Montreal cognitive assessment ( MOCA) , and Movement Disorders Society-sponsored revision of the- Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( MDS-UPDRS-III). A group of patients underwent repeat assessment within 2 weeks. Thirty-four healthy controls were recruited for comparison. Patients ' mean age was 66.2 years , disease duration was 8.7 years , on-state MDS-UPDRS-III was 22 , and MOCA total score was 27. CIT effectively generated interference , whereby the total time taken to complete the incongruent task was 20 % longer compared to that of the baseline task. CIT key test items demonstrated convergent validity to VST ( r = 0.478-0.644 , p < 0.0001) and satisfactory repeatability ( intraclass correlation coefficient 0.46-0.808 , p â‰¤ 0.0002). Performance on key CIT test parameters deteriorated with increasing age ( r = 0.225-0.478 , p < 0.01) and MDS-UPDRS-III total score ( r = 0.354-0.481 , p < 0.0001). When compared to controls and patients with less motor impairment , patients MDS-UPDRS-III > 30 took longer to complete CIT and VST and had lower MOCA-attention sub-score , implying that the degree of motor impairment could not be the sole explanation for reduced CIT performance. We established that despite motor impairment , the novel approach of using smartphone technology to test interference in PD patients is feasible.
