 Organs from deceased donors with suspected false-positive HIV<pathogen> screening tests were generally discarded due to the chance that the test was truly positive. However , the HIV<pathogen> Organ Policy Equity ( HOPE) Act now facilitates use of such organs for transplantation to HIV-infected ( HIV<pathogen> +) individuals. In the HOPE in Action trial , donors without a known HIV<pathogen> infection who unexpectedly tested positive for anti-HIV antibody ( Ab) or HIV<pathogen> nucleic acid test ( NAT) were classified as suspected false-positive donors. Between March 2016 and March 2018 , 10 suspected false-positive donors had organs recovered for transplant for 21 HIV<pathogen> + recipients ( 14 single-kidney , 1 double-kidney , 5 liver , 1 simultaneous liver-kidney). Median donor age was 24 years; cause of death was trauma ( n = 5) , stroke ( n = 4) , and anoxia ( n = 1); three donors were labeled Public Health Service increased infectious risk. Median kidney donor profile index was 30.5 ( IQR 22-58). Eight donors were HIV<pathogen> Ab +/ NAT-; two were HIV<pathogen> Ab-/ NAT +. All 10 suspected false-positive donors were confirmed to be HIV-noninfected. Given the false-positive rates of approved assays used to screen > 20 000 deceased donors annually , we estimate 50-100 HIV<pathogen> false-positive donors per year. Organ transplantation from suspected HIV<pathogen> false-positive donors is an unexpected benefit of the HOPE Act that provides another novel organ source.
