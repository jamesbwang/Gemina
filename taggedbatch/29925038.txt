 This single specialty , multi-institutional study aimed to determine: 1) the association between milestone ratings for individual competencies and average milestone ratings ( AMRs) and 2) the association between AMRs and recommended supervisory role categorizations made by individual clinical competency committee ( CCC) members. During the 2015-16 academic year , CCC members at 14 pediatric residencies reported milestone ratings for 21 competencies and recommended supervisory role categories ( may not supervise , may supervise in some settings , may supervise in all settings) for residents they reviewed. An exploratory factor analysis of competencies was conducted. The associations between individual competencies , the AMR , and supervisory role categorizations were determined by computing bivariate correlations. The relationship between AMRs and recommended supervisory role categorizations was examined using an ordinal mixed logistic regression model. 68/155 CCC members completed both milestone assignments and supervision categorizations for 451 residents. Factor analysis of individual competencies controlling for clustering of residents in raters and sites resulted in a single-factor solution ( cumulative variance 0.75). All individual competencies had large positive correlations with the AMR ( correlation coefficient: 0.84-0.93) , except for two professionalism competencies ( Prof1: 0.63 and Prof4: 0.65). When combined across training year and time points , the AMR and supervisory role categorization had a moderately positive correlation ( 0.56). This exploratory study identified a modest correlation between average milestone ratings and supervisory role categorization. Convergence of competencies on a single factor deserves further exploration , with possible rater effects warranting attention.
