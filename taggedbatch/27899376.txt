 Given that early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) , metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom> ( MetS) , and hyperuricemia have been shown to have strong genetic components , the statistical power of a genetic association study may be increased by focusing on early-onset subjects with these conditions. Although genome-wide association studies have identified various genes and loci significantly associated with T2DM , MetS , and hyperuricemia , genetic variants that contribute to predisposition to these conditions in Japanese subjects remain to be identified definitively. We performed exome-wide association studies ( EWASs) for early-onset T2DM , MetS , or hyperuricemia to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to these conditions. A total of 8,102 individuals aged ≤ 65 years were enrolled in the present study. The EWAS for T2DM was performed with 7,407 subjects ( 1,696 cases , 5,711 controls) , that for MetS with 4,215 subjects ( 2,296 cases , 1,919 controls) , and that for hyperuricemia with 7,919 subjects ( 1,365 cases , 6,554 controls). Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) were genotyped with Illumina Human Exome-12 DNA Analysis BeadChip or Infinium Exome-24 BeadChip arrays. The relationship of allele frequencies for 31,210 , 31,521 , or 31,142 SNPs that passed quality control for T2DM , MetS , or hyperuricemia , respectively , was examined with Fisher 's exact test. To compensate for multiple comparisons of genotypes with T2DM , MetS , or hyperuricemia , we applied Bonferroni 's correction for statistical significance of association. The EWAS of allele frequencies revealed that four , six , or nine SNPs were significantly associated with T2DM ( P < 1.60 × 10
