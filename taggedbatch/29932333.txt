 Engineering hybrid protein-DNA assemblies in a controlled manner has attracted particular attention , for their potential applications in biomedicine and nanotechnology due to their intricate folding properties and important physiological roles. Although DNA origami has served as a powerful platform for spatially arranging functional molecules , in situ assembly of proteins onto DNA origami is still challenging , especially in a precisely controlled and facile manner. Here , we demonstrate in situ assembly of tobacco mosaic virus ( TMV) coat proteins onto DNA origami to generate programmable assembly of hybrid DNA origami-protein nanoarchitectures. The protein nanotubes of controlled length are precisely anchored on the DNA origami at selected locations using TMV genome-mimicking RNA strands. This study opens a new route to the organization of protein and DNA into sophisticated protein-DNA nanoarchitectures by harnessing the viral encapsidation mechanism and the programmability of DNA origami.
