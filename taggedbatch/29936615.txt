 Arsenic concentration and distribution were studied by combining laboratory X-ray-based techniques ( wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence ( WDXRF) , micro X-ray fluorescence ( μXRF) , and X-ray powder diffraction ( XRPD)) , field emission scanning electron microscopy equipped with microanalysis ( FE-SEM-EDX) , and sequential extraction procedure ( SEP) coupled to total reflection X-ray fluorescence ( TXRF) analysis. This approach was applied to three contaminated soils and one mine tailing collected near the gold extraction plant at the Crocette gold mine ( Macugnaga , VB) in the Monte Rosa mining district ( Piedmont , Italy). Arsenic ( As) concentration , measured with WDXRF , ranged from 145 to 40,200 mg/kg. XRPD analysis evidenced the presence of jarosite and the absence of any As-bearing mineral , suggesting a high weathering grade and strong oxidative conditions. However , small domains of Fe arsenate were identified by combining μXRF with FE-SEM-EDX. SEP results revealed that As was mainly associated to amorphous Fe oxides/hydroxides or hydroxysulfates ( 50-80 %) and the combination of XRPD and FE-SEM-EDX suggested that this phase could be attributed to schwertmannite. On the basis of the reported results , As is scarcely mobile , even if a consistent As fraction ( 1-3 g As/kg of soil) is still potentially mobilizable. In general , the proposed combination of laboratory X-ray techniques could be successfully employed to unravel environmental issues related to metal ( loid) pollution in soil and sediments.
