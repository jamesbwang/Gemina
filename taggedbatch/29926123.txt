 The prevention of post-operative pulmonary complications ( PPC) is targeted by several enhanced recovery ( ERAS) items including early mobilisation , prevention of fluid overload and omission of routine nasogastric tubes. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of ERAS on PPC. This was a retrospective analysis of an institutional database including consecutive colorectal ERAS procedures from May 2011 until May 2017. Multiple logistic regressions were performed to identify risk factors for PPC among demographic , surgical characteristics and items related to the ERAS protocol. In total , 1298 patients were included; among them 120 ( 9.2 %) had one or more PPC. Multivariable analysis retained minimally invasive surgery ( odds ratio ( OR) 0.26; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.15-0.46) and compliance to the ERAS protocol of ≥ 70 % ( OR 0.53; CI 0.30-0.94) as protective factors. Emergency surgery ( OR 2.70; CI 1.20-6.01) , blood<symptom> loss<symptom> of ≥ 200 mL ( OR 2.06; CI 1.20-3.53) and ASA score of ≥ 3 ( OR 2.00; CI 1.12-3.57) were independent risk factors. Median length of hospital stay was significantly longer in patients who experienced respiratory complications ( 21 ( 4-183) vs. 6 ( 1-95) days , p ≤ 0.001). Minimally invasive surgery and high compliance with the ERAS protocol can help to prevent PPC.
