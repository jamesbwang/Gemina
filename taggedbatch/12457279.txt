 Reporter gene systems can serve as therapy targets. However , the therapeutic use of reporters has been limited by the challenges of transgene delivery to a majority of cancer cells. This study specifically assesses the efficacy of targeting human somatostatin receptor subtype 2 ( hSSTR2) with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy ( PRRT) when a small subpopulation of cells bears the transgene.
