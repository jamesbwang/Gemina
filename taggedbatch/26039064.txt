 p62 ( also known as sequestosome 1) protein , is a small regulatory protein that accumulates in autophagy-defective cells that has been demonstrated to be involved in the prognosis and survival of patients with several types of cancer. However , to the best of our knowledge , there have been no such studies for osteosarcoma ( OS). In the present study , the expression of p62 in 70 OS samples was determined using immunohistochemistry and its association with various clinicopathological factors was assessed. The results demonstrated that the overexpression of p62 protein was detected in 77.1 % ( 54/70) samples , and the expression levels were significantly associated with tumor size ( P = 0.001) , metastasis ( P = 0.036) , clinical staging ( P = 0.003) and poor prognosis ( P = 0.0058). Furthermore , suppression of the p62 expression by short hairpin RNA interference in F5M2 and F4 cells lines led to decreased cell proliferation , migration and invasion
