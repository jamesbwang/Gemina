 To describe the clinical characteristics of children and adolescents undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT) who develop oral mucositis. 45 patients who underwent HCT from July 2015 to May 2016 at St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital in Memphis , Tennessee. Clinical factors were described as transplantation type , mucositis severity or grade , mucositis duration , days to engraftment , total parenteral nutrition ( TPN) support , IV opioid pain management use during mucositis , positive blood or oral cultures , and length of hospitalization , then compared across mucositis grade. 24 patients had grade 3 or greater mucositis onset from day -3 to day 9 of transplantation; of these , 23 required IV opioid medication to treat mucosal pain. Patients with mucositis grade 3 or greater were more likely to have undergone an allogeneic transplantation , receive TPN , have documented positive blood or oral cultures , and have longer hospitalizations than those with low-grade mucositis. Nurses are in a unique position to propose and administer interventions to prevent and alleviate symptoms of mucositis.
