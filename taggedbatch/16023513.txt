 Triclosan and triclocarban ( TCs) are broad-spectrum antimicrobials that , until recently , were found in a wide variety of household and personal wash products. Popular with consumers , TCs have not been shown to protect against infectious<disease> diseases<disease>. To determine whether use of TC-containing wash products reduces incidence of infection in children less than one year of age. Starting in 2011 , we nested a randomized intervention of wash products with and without TCs within a multiethnic birth cohort. Maternal reports of infectious<disease> disease<disease> symptoms and antibiotic use were collected weekly by automated survey; household visits occurred every four months. Antibiotic prescriptions were identified by medical chart review. Urinary triclosan levels were measured in a participant subset. Differences by intervention group in reported infectious<disease> disease<disease> ( primary outcome) and antibiotic use ( secondary outcome) were assessed using mixed effects logistic regression and Fisher 's Exact tests , respectively. Infectious illness occurred in 6 % of weeks , with upper respiratory illness the predominant syndrome<disease><symptom>. Among 60 ( 45 %) TC-exposed and 73 ( 55 %) non-TC-exposed babies , infectious<disease> disease<disease> reports did not differ in frequency between groups ( likelihood ratio test: p = 0.88). Medical visits with antibiotic prescriptions were less common in the TC group than in the non-TC group ( 7.8 % vs. 16.6 % , respectively; p = 0.02). Although randomization to TC-containing wash products was not associated with decreased infectious<disease> disease<disease> reports by mothers , TCs were associated with decreased antibiotic prescriptions , suggesting a benefit against bacterial infection. The recent removal of TCs from consumer wash products makes further elucidation of benefits and risks impracticable.
