 Many employers now incentivize employees to engage in wellness programs , yet few studies have examined differences in preferences for incentivizing participation in healthy behaviors and wellness programs. We surveyed 2,436 employees of a large university about their preferences for incentivizing participation in different types of healthy behaviors and then used multivariable logistic regression to estimate associations between employees ' socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and their preferences for incentives for engaging in healthy behaviors. Compared with nonunion members , union members had higher odds of wanting an incentive for eating healthily ( adjusted odds ratio ( AOR) = 1.60 , 95 % ( CI; 1.21 , 2.12)) , managing weight ( AOR = 1.53 , 95 % CI ( 1.14 , 2.06)) , avoiding drinking too much alcohol ( AOR = 1.41 , 95 % CI ( 1.11 , 1.78)) , quitting tobacco ( AOR = 1.37 , 95 % CI ( 1.06 , 1.77)) , managing stress ( AOR = 1.37 , 95 % CI ( 1.08 , 1.75)) , and managing back pain ( AOR = 1.64 , 95 % CI ( 1.28 , 2.10)). Compared with staff , faculty employees reported higher odds for wanting an incentive for reducing alcohol intake ( AOR = 1.34 , 95 % CI ( 1.00 , 1.78)) and quitting tobacco ( AOR = 1.43 , 95 % CI ( 1.04 , 1.96)). Women had lower odds than men ( AOR = 0.80 , 95 % CI ( 0.64 , 0.99)) of wanting an incentive for managing back pain. Preferences for incentives to engage in different types of healthy behaviors differed by employees ' socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Organizations may consider using survey data on employee preferences for incentives to more effectively engage higher risk populations in wellness programs.
