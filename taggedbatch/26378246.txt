 Time restricted feeding decreases energy intake without calorie counting and may be a viable option for weight<symptom> loss<symptom>. However , the effect of this diet on body<symptom> weight in obese subjects has never been examined. This study investigated the effects of 8-h time restricted feeding on body<symptom> weight and metabolic disease risk factors in obese adults. Obese subjects ( Body<symptom> weight and energy intake decreased in the time restricted group ( -2.6 % ± 0.5; -341 ± 53 kcal/d) relative to controls over 12 weeks ( These findings suggest that 8-h time restricted feeding produces mild caloric restriction and weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , without calorie counting. It may also offer clinical benefits by reducing blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>.
