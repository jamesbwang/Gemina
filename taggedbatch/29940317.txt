 A novel hairy-shaped Ni nanowire embedded nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped carbon nanofibers ( Ni/N , S-CNFs) with superior electrocatalytic properties for urea oxidation reaction ( UOR) was reported. The Ni/N , S-CNFs was prepared by electrospinning and carbonization process , using melamine-trithiocyanuric acid ( MTCA) aggregates as both the N and S element sources. Noteworthy , MTCA also favored the formation of Ni nanowire via vapor liquid-solid mechanism , while Ni nanoparticles loaded CNFs ( Ni/CNFs) was obtained without MTCA. For UOR tests , a high peak current intensity of 37.0 mA mg
