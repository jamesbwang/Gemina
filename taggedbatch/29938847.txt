 The development of organic semiconductors for photovoltaic devices , over the last three decades , has led to unexpected performance for an alternative choice of materials to convert sunlight to electricity. New materials and developed concepts have improved the photovoltage in organic photovoltaic devices , where records are now found above 13 % power conversion efficiency in sunlight. The author has stayed with the topic of organic materials for energy conversion and energy storage during these three decades , and makes use of the Hall of Fame now built by Advanced Materials , to present his view of the path travelled over this time , including motivations , personalities , and ambitions.
