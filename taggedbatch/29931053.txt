 Intracellular signalling is realised by complex signalling networks which are almost impossible to understand without network models , especially if feedbacks are involved. Modular Response Analysis ( MRA) is a convenient modelling method to study signalling networks in various contexts. We developed the software package STASNet that provides an augmented and extended version of MRA suited to model signalling networks from incomplete perturbation schemes and multi-perturbation data. Using data from the DREAM challenge , we show that predictions from STASNet models are among the top-performing methods. We applied the method to study the effect of SHP2 , a protein that has been implicated in resistance to targeted therapy in colon cancer , using a novel data set from the colon cancer cell line Widr and a SHP2-depleted derivative. We find that SHP2 is required for MAPK signalling , whereas AKT signalling only partially depends on SHP2. An R-package is available at https://github.com/molsysbio/STASNet. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
