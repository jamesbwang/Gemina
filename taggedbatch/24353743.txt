 Moxifloxacin is an antibiotic used in clinics and has recently been used as a clinically compatible cell-labeling agent for two-photon ( 2P) imaging. Although 2P imaging with moxifloxacin labeling visualized cells inside tissues using enhanced fluorescence , the imaging depth was quite limited because of the relatively short excitation wavelength ( < 800 nm) used. In this study , the feasibility of three-photon ( 3P) excitation of moxifloxacin using a longer excitation wavelength and moxifloxacin-based 3P imaging were tested to increase the imaging depth. Moxifloxacin fluorescence via 3P excitation was detected at a > 1000 nm excitation wavelength. After obtaining the excitation and emission spectra of moxifloxacin , moxifloxacin-based 3P imaging was applied to ex vivo mouse bladder and ex vivo mouse small intestine tissues and compared with moxifloxacin-based 2P imaging by switching the excitation wavelength of a Ti: sapphire oscillator between near 1030 and 780 nm. Both moxifloxacin-based 2P and 3P imaging visualized cellular structures in the tissues via moxifloxacin labeling , but the image contrast was better with 3P imaging than with 2P imaging at the same imaging depths. The imaging speed and imaging depth of moxifloxacin-based 3P imaging using a Ti: sapphire oscillator were limited by insufficient excitation power. Therefore , we constructed a new system for moxifloxacin-based 3P imaging using a high-energy Yb fiber laser at 1030 nm and used it for in vivo deep tissue imaging of a mouse small intestine. Moxifloxacin-based 3P imaging could be useful for clinical applications with enhanced imaging depth.
