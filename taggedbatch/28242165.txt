 There is little consensus on the optimal treatment approach for newly diagnosed patients. The present study aims to provide additional evidence by evaluating a series of patients diagnosed with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma ( ATC) and analyzing factors related to increased survival. This was a retrospective cohort report structured according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology ( STROBE) guideline. Demographics , chief complaint , history of prior thyroid cancer , stage at presentation , management modalities ( surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , or observation) , completeness or resection , and survival period since initial diagnosis were reviewed for patients with documentation of histologic ATC diagnosis between 2003 and 2016. The median survival period for 34 patients ( 11 males , 23 females) was 93.5 days. Patients aged 70 or younger ( 111 days) tended to survive longer than those older 70 ( 88 days) ( P = .081). Observation , surgery only , radiotherapy only , and chemo-radiotherapy after surgery group showed median survival of 88 days , 49 days ( range 14-528) , 61.5 days , and 225 days , respectively. There was also no significant difference in survival between the 10 ( 29.4 %) stage IVb ( 225 days) and 23 ( 67.7 %) IVc ( 88 days) patients ( P = .242). The median survival of the R1 resection group was 514 days while that of the R2 group was 102 days ( P = .338). There were no significant difference between patients with the de novo ATC ( 112 days) and patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma origin ATC ( 99 days) ( P = .297). Results from our series of 34 patients with ATC show that more intense combination of surgery and chemo-radiotherapy tends to secure a longer survival period. Therefore we recommend a multi-modality approach after a comprehensive consultation with the patient.
