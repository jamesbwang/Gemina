 The newly emerged Middle<pathogen> East<pathogen> respiratory<pathogen><disease> syndrome<pathogen><disease><symptom> coronavirus<pathogen> ( MERS-CoV) continues to infect humans and camels , calling for efficient , cost-effective , and broad-spectrum strategies to control its spread. Nanobodies ( Nbs) are single-domain antibodies derived from camelids and sharks , and are potentially cost-effective antivirals with small size and great expression yield. In this study , we developed a novel neutralizing Nb ( NbMS10) and its human-Fc-fused version ( NbMS10-Fc) , both of which target the MERS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain ( RBD). We further tested their receptor-binding affinity , recognizing epitopes , cross-neutralizing activity , half-life , and efficacy against MERS-CoV infection. Both Nbs can be expressed in yeasts with high yield , bind to MERS-CoV RBD with high affinity , and block the binding of MERS-CoV RBD to the MERS-CoV receptor. The binding site of the Nbs on the RBD was mapped to be around residue Asp539 , which is part of a conserved conformational epitope at the receptor-binding interface. NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc maintained strong cross-neutralizing activity against divergent MERS-CoV strains isolated from humans and camels. Particularly , NbMS10-Fc had significantly extended half-life
