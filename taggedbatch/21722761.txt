 Lymphatic filariasis<disease> is a complex parasitic<disease> disease<disease> having a spectrum of clinical parameters which are critical in deciding the severity of the pathogenesis. Individuals residing in the endemic areas are categorized into different clinical groups such as: EC ( endemic controls-free of disease and infection) , AS ( asymptomatic carriers- free of disease but carries both antigens and microfilaria ( Mf) in circulation) , CR ( cryptic-free of disease and Mf but having circulatory antigen) and CH ( chronic-having manifestations of elephantiasis and hydrocele). The immune response to the parasitic infection is well studied , whereas the protective mechanism explaining the fate of antigenemia and filaremia between AS and CR group remains unexplained. Increased anti-Mf antibodies have been implicated for Mf clearance in experimental infection models whereas its role in clinical filariasis<disease> is not known. Here , we followed up two groups of 24 and 33 CR cases for 18 and 36 months respectively and analyzed both the clinical parameters and the anti-filarial antibody response. The humoral response to both whole filarial antigen and Mf antigens as well as recombinant active parasitic antigens was significantly higher in CR cases than AS individuals , whereas the clinical parameters remain unchanged. This study made insights into the protective immune mechanism responsible for the clearance of Mf from circulation in CR individuals.
