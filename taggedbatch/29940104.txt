 Most reported bacterial phosphofructokinases ( Pfks) are tetramers that exhibit activity allosterically regulated via conformational changes between the R and T states. We report that the Pfk from Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> NCTC<pathogen> 8325 ( SaPfk) exists as both an active tetramer and an inactive dimer in solution. Multiple effectors , including pH , ADP , ATP , and adenylyl-imidodiphosphate ( AMP-PNP) , cause equilibrium shifts from the tetramer to dimer , whereas the substrate F6P stabilizes SaPfk tetrameric assembly. Crystal structures of SaPfk in complex with different ligands and biochemical analysis reveal that the flexibility of the Gly150-Leu151 motif in helix Î±7 plays a role in tetramer-dimer conversion. Thus , we propose a molecular mechanism for allosteric regulation of bacterial Pfk via conversion between the tetramer and dimer in addition to the well-characterized R-state/T-state mechanism.
