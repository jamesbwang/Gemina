 Mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSCs) are an excellent and easily accessible source of precursor cells that have applications in regenerative medicine. They can be obtained from almost any tissue; however , bone<disease> marrow , Wharton 's jelly and adipose tissue are the most frequently used sources of MSCs. Increased interest in using MSCs in medical procedures has resulted in a pressing need to identify the genetic elements that can indicate the presence and the characteristics of MSCs. Genomic profiling enables the identification and characterization of MSCs as well as finding biomarkers and key molecules involved in all processes occurring in the cell. This knowledge is essential for developing a stem cell approach for tissue engineering and can improve the development of new clinical applications of MSCs. This review is an attempt to give an overview of key genetic markers indicating the main directions of MSC differentiation. The expression of these genes provides information about the direction and progress of differentiation and about interactions with the surrounding environment as well as specific molecular pathways that MSCs are involved in.
