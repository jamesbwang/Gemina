 We estimated the diagnostic accuracy of T2Candida , with blood culture ( BC) as the gold standard , and compared turnaround time between these two techniques in order to investigate the potential role of T2Candida in the management of empirical antifungal treatment ( EAT). We performed a single-centre prospective observational study in patients with severe sepsis<disease> or septic shock<symptom> and multiple risk factors for candidaemia. We analysed 46 out of 50 screened patients. All patients received an echinocandin as EAT; the median EAT duration was 7 days ( IQR 4-13 days). BCs were negative in 31 ( 67.4 %) patients , positive for bacteria in 14 ( 30.4 %) patients and positive for Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> in 1 ( 2.2 %) patient. T2Candida was negative , invalid and positive in 37 , 5 and 4 patients , respectively. T2Candida and BC results were concordant in all but three patients , where T2Candida was positive and BCs were negative. Two of them were on antifungal prophylaxis at the time of enrolment. T2Candida reduced time to a negative result by 5 days. T2Candida performance was: sensitivity = 100 % ( 95 % CI 2.5 % -100 %) , specificity = 91.8 % ( 95 % CI 78 % -98 %) , positive predictive value = 25 % ( 95 % CI 0.63 % -80.6 %) and negative predictive value = 100 % ( 95 % CI 89.7 % -100 %). In patients with multiple risk factors for candidaemia and severe sepsis<disease> or septic shock<symptom> , T2Candida may be helpful to reduce the length of EAT.
