 In this work , a new strategy for solving multiscale topology optimization problems is presented. An alternate direction algorithm and a precomputed offline microstructure database ( Computational Vademecum) are used to efficiently solve the problem. In addition , the influence of considering manufacturable constraints is examined. Then , the strategy is extended to solve the coupled problem of designing both the macroscopic and microscopic topologies. Full details of the algorithms and numerical examples to validate the methodology are provided.
