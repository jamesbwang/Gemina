 Laparoscopic colorectal surgery has an established role. The ability to multitask ( use a retraction tool with one hand and navigate a laparoscopic camera with the other) is desired for efficient laparoscopic surgery. Surgical trainees must learn this skill to perform advanced laparoscopic tasks. The aim was to determine whether a box-training protocol improves the stability of retraction while multitasking in colorectal surgery simulation. Fifty-eight medical students were recruited to attend a basic laparoscopic box-training course. Ability to perform steady retraction with and without multitasking was measured initially and at the conclusion of the course. Before training , students demonstrated a decrease in performance while multitasking with a greater maximal exerted force , a greater range of force , and a greater standard deviation for traction and minimal exerted force , range of force and a greater standard deviation for countertraction. Statistically significant improvement ( lower maximal exerted force and lower range of force) was observed for traction while multitasking after training. After the training , no statistically significant differences were found when the student performed a single task versus multitasking , both for traction and countertraction. A structured box-training curriculum improved the stability of retraction while multitasking in this colorectal surgery simulation. Although it did not improve stability of retraction as a single task , it did improve stability of retraction while multitasking. After training , this enables the trainee to retract as efficiently while operating the camera as they retract when only focusing on retraction as a single task.
