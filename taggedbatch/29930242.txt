 Atopic dermatitis<disease> ( AD) is the most common chronic<disease> inflammatory skin disease , with a lifetime prevalence of up to 20 % and substantial effects on quality of life. AD is characterized by intense itch , recurrent eczematous lesions<symptom> and a fluctuating course. AD has a strong heritability component and is closely related to and commonly co-occurs with other atopic diseases ( such as asthma and allergic rhinitis). Several pathophysiological mechanisms contribute to AD aetiology and clinical manifestations. Impairment of epidermal barrier function , for example , owing to deficiency in the structural protein filaggrin , can promote inflammation<symptom> and T cell infiltration. The immune response in AD is skewed towards T helper 2 cell-mediated pathways and can in turn favour epidermal barrier disruption. Other contributing factors to AD onset include dysbiosis of the skin microbiota ( in particular overgrowth of Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>) , systemic immune responses ( including immunoglobulin E ( IgE)- mediated sensitization) and neuroinflammation , which is involved in itch. Current treatments for AD include topical moisturizers and anti-inflammatory agents ( such as corticosteroids , calcineurin inhibitors and cAMP-specific 3 ' ,5 '- cyclic phosphodiesterase 4 ( PDE4) inhibitors) , phototherapy and systemic immunosuppressants. Translational research has fostered the development of targeted small molecules and biologic therapies , especially for moderate-to-severe disease.
