 For an elastic medium containing a homogeneous distribution of micro-cracks , an effective one-dimensional stress-strain relation has been determined with finite element simulations. In addition to flat micro-cracks , voids were considered that contain a Hertzian contact , which represents an example for micro-cracks with internal structure. The orientation of both types of micro-cracks was fully aligned or , for flat micro-cracks , totally random. For micro-cracks with Hertzian contacts , the case of random orientation was treated in an approximate way. The two types of defects were found to give rise to different degrees of non-analytic behavior of the effective stress-strain relation , which governs the nonlinear propagation of symmetric ( S0) Lamb waves in the long-wavelength limit. The presence of flat micro-cracks causes even harmonics to grow linearly with propagation distance with amplitudes proportional to the amplitude of the fundamental wave , and gives rise to a static strain. The presence of the second type of defects leads to a linear growth of all harmonics with amplitudes proportional to the power 3/2 of the fundamental amplitude , and to a strain-dependent velocity shift. Simple expressions are given for the growth rates of higher harmonics of S0 Lamb waves in terms of the parameters occurring in the effective stress-strain relation. They have partly been determined quantitatively with the help of the FEM results for different micro-crack concentrations.
