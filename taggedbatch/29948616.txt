 Regional lymph nodes ( LN) s represent important immunological barriers in spreading of malignant tumors. However , they are the most frequent early metastatic site in melanoma. Immunomodulatory agents including cytokines have been included in therapy of melanoma and have shown severe side effects and toxicity.

Therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of interleukin ( IL) -2 and IL-15 , the two cytokines with similar immune-enhancing effects , on the expression of activating NKG2D , inhibitory CD158a and CD158b receptors on CD8
