 To examine the cross-sectional association between anticholinergic medication burden ( ACB) and a history of falls , bone mineral density , and low trauma fractures in middle-aged women aged under 65 years from the Aberdeen Prospective Osteoporosis Screening Study. ACB ( 0 = none , 1 = possible , ≥ 2 = definite) was calculated from medication use for 3883 Caucasian women ( mean age ( SD) = 54.3 ( 2.3) years) attending the second Aberdeen Prospective Osteoporosis Screening Study visit ( 1997-2000). Outcomes were examined using logistic regression. Model adjustments were selected a priori based on expert opinion. Of 3883 participants , 3293 scored ACB = 0 , 328 scored ACB = 1 , and 262 scored ACB ≥ 2. High ACB burden ( ≥ 2) was associated with increased odds ( ACB = 0 reference) for falls ( fully adjusted odds ratio ( 95 % confidence intervals) = 1.81 ( 1.25-2.62); P = 0.002) and having low bone mineral density ( lowest quintile-20 %) at Ward 's triangle ( 3.22 ( 1.30-7.99); P = 0.01). A history of falls over the year prior to the study visit in participants with ACB score ≥ 2 was 32 per 100. For ACB categories 1 and 0 , a history of falls per 100 was 21 and 22 , respectively. The risk of falling associated with ACB observed in older age may also extend to middle-aged women.
