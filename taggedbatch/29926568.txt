 Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition due to a tear in the intimal layer of the aorta or bleeding within the aortic wall , resulting in the separation of the different layers of the aortic wall. Among the risk factors , age , hypertension , dyslipidemia and genetic disorders of the connective tissue have been identified. A prompt diagnosis and an adequate treatment are important in the management of affected patients. The type of treatment depends on the location and extension of the dissection. Open surgical repair is most commonly used for dissections involving the ascending aorta and the aortic arch , whereas endovascular intervention is indicated for descending aorta dissections that are complicated. In this paper , we will review the epidemiology , and physiopathology of aortic dissection and describe the appropriate management for each type of dissection ( open surgery , endovascular or medical treatment).
