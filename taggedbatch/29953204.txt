 A surface plasmon resonance ( SPR) biosensor-based active ingredients recognition system ( SPR-AIRS) was developed , validated , and applied to screen signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3) ligands. First , features of the screening system were investigated in four aspects: ( 1) specificity of the STAT3-immobilized chip , it shows that the chip could be applied to screen STAT3 ligands from complex mixture; ( 2) linearity and limit of detection ( LOD) of the system , the minimum recovery cycle number was determined as 5 cycles; ( 3) saturability of the chip , the results indicate that it is necessary to select a proper concentration based on the compound 's K
