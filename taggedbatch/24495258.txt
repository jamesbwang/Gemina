 To estimate the rate of paediatric attendance at emergency departments ( EDs) in the Lombardy Region , Italy , and to determine the factors contributing to different patterns of use. By analysing healthcare administrative databases , ED attendance by 1.6 million youths < 18 years old during 2012 in the Lombardy Region was assessed. The pattern of use was categorised based on the number of ED visits and level of emergency , defined by triage code and outcome of the visit. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the characteristics of access for non-urgent reasons and those of patients with frequent non-urgent access ( â‰¥ 4 accesses for non-urgent reasons only). A case-control study was carried out to compare healthcare resource use by children 1-5 years old who were ` frequent non-urgent users ' with that of randomly selected controls , matched by age , gender , nationality and primary care physician. During 2012 , 440284 ( 27 %) of children and adolescents had at least one ED attendance , with trauma ( 26 %) and respiratory<disease><symptom> tract<symptom><disease> infections<disease> ( 22 %) as the most frequent diagnoses. In all , 533037 ( 79 %) accesses were for non-urgent reasons , and 12533 ( 3 % of the ED users) were frequent non-urgent users. Male gender ( OR 1.12; 95 % CI 1.08 to 1.17) , preschool age ( OR 3.14; 95 % CI 2.98 to 3.31) and place of residence ( OR 1.74; 95 % CI 1.70 to 1.99) were associated with a higher risk of being a frequent non-urgent user. Moreover , a greater healthcare consumption was observed in this group. One out of four children and adolescents attended the ED at least once per year , 3 % of whom were frequent non-urgent users , with a high overall healthcare resource consumption.
