 The purpose of the study was to analyse the in-hospital results of surgical treatment in a total of 275 patients presenting with atherosclerotic occlusive and stenotic lesions<symptom> of the aortofemoral segment within the framework of a single-centre prospective register. The authors performed a detailed analysis of prognostic significance of a wide spectrum of clinico-instrumental , anatomo-angiographic and perioperative factors , followed by revealing the causes of an unfavourable prognosis during the in-hospital period. Based on the obtained findings , they determined significant risk factors for an unfavourable outcome: clinicodemographic ( chronic renal insufficiency , grade IV chronic lower limb ischaemia) and surgical ( cross-clamping of the aorta for more than 30 min). A high frequency rate of preventive coronary revascularization appeared to have become a protective mechanism making it possible to prevent the development of myocardial infarction in the studied cohort of patients.
