 The behaviour of all living beings consists of hidden patterns in time; consequently , its nature and its underlying dynamics are intrinsically difficult to be perceived and detected by the unaided observer. Such a scientific challenge calls for improved means of detection , data handling and analysis. By using a powerful and versatile technique known as T-pattern detection and analysis ( TPA) it is possible to unveil hidden relationships among the behavioural events in time. TPA is demonstrated to be a solid and versatile tool to study the deep structure of behaviour in different experimental contexts , both in human and non human subjects. This review deepens and extends contents recently published by adding new concepts and examples concerning the applications of TPA in the study of behaviour both in human and non-human subjects.
