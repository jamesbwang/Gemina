 Multiple investigators have sought to identify risk factors for cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) leak following cerebellopontine angle ( CPA) tumor resection. We evaluated whether pneumatization of the petrous apex ( PA) is a risk factor for CSF fistula<disease>. We conducted a retrospective chart review at 2 major tertiary academic institutions undergoing CPA tumor resection and analyzed their respective head or temporal computed tomography ( CT) scans if available. A total of 91 cases were identified; 51 ( 64 %) demonstrated PA pneumatization , and a total of 17 CSF leaks were identified. We discovered higher rates of CSF leak ( 25.0 % vs 13.7 %; P = .273) and CSF rhinorrhea ( 15.0 % vs 5.9 %; P = .174) in patients with PA pneumatization compared to those without PA pneumatization. Isolated PA pneumatization may be a risk factor and communication pathway for CSF fistula<disease>. Further studies will need to be broadened across multiple institutions to draw any additional and stronger conclusions.
