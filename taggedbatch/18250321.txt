 In this work we present a systematic effort to summarize current biological pathway knowledge concerning Rheumatoid Arthritis<disease><symptom> ( RA). We are constructing a detailed molecular map based on exhaustive literature scanning , strict curation criteria , re-evaluation of previously published attempts and most importantly experts ' advice. The RA map will be web-published in the coming months in the form of an interactive map , using the MINERVA platform , allowing for easy access , navigation and search of all molecular pathways implicated in RA , serving thus , as an on line knowledgebase for the disease. Moreover the map could be used as a template for Omics data visualization offering a first insight about the pathways affected in different experimental datasets. The second goal of the project is a dynamical study focused on synovial fibroblasts ' behavior under different initial conditions specific to RA , as recent studies have shown that synovial fibroblasts play a crucial role in driving the persistent , destructive characteristics of the disease. Leaning on the RA knowledgebase and using the web platform Cell Collective , we are currently building a Boolean large scale dynamical model for the study of RA fibroblasts ' activation.
