 Geminiviruses are DNA viruses that replicate in nuclei of infected plant cells using the plant DNA replication machinery , including PCNA ( Proliferating cellular nuclear antigen) , a cofactor that orchestrates genome duplication and maintenance by recruiting crucial players to replication forks. These viruses encode a multifunctional protein , Rep , which is essential for viral replication , induces the accumulation of the host replication machinery and interacts with several host proteins , including PCNA and the SUMO E2 conjugation enzyme ( SCE1). Post-translational modification of PCNA by ubiquitin or SUMO plays an essential role in the switching of PCNA between interacting partners during DNA metabolism processes ( e.g. replication , recombination , repair , etc.). In yeast , PCNA sumoylation has been associated to DNA repair involving homologous recombination ( HR). Previously , we reported that ectopic Rep expression results in very specific changes in the sumoylation pattern of plant cells. In this work , we show , using a reconstituted sumoylation system in
