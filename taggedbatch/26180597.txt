 Recent studies indicate that inflammation<symptom> may also affect CYP3A4 activity. Associations of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of quinine , with inflammatory biomarkers were investigated in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis ( HD). A single dose of 100 mg quinine was given to 44 HD patients and the plasma concentration of quinine and its metabolite 3-OH-quinine were measured 12 h after drug intake. The ratios of quinine/3-OH-quinine and 4β-OH-cholesterol/cholesterol were used as markers of CYP3A4 activity. Inflammatory biomarkers , high-sensitive CRP ( hsCRP) , pentraxin 3 ( PTX3) and orosomucoid were followed during 4 weeks prior to quinine administration. The quinine/3-OH-quinine ratio correlated with median concentrations of hsCRP ( Rho = 0.48; p = 0.001) and orosomucoid ( Rho = 0.44; p = 0.003) , and also with interleukin-6 at 12 h after drug intake ( Rho = 0.43; P = 0.004) but not PTX3. In multivariate regression analysis , the correlation between CYP3A4 activity and median hsCRP remained borderline significant ( p = 0.05). 4β-OH-cholesterol/cholesterol ratio correlated with quinine/3-OH-quinine ( p = 0.008) , but not with any of the inflammation<symptom> markers. The association between CYP3A4 activity and inflammatory biomarkers suggest that the activity of CYP3A4 is reduced by inflammation<symptom> in HD patients. Further studies are needed to confirm this finding and to assess to what extent magnitude and duration of inflammation<symptom> as well as the microbiota affect drug metabolism.
