 French Society of ENT ( SFORL) good practice guidelines for audiometric examination in adults and children. A multidisciplinary working group performed a review of the scientific literature. Guidelines were drawn up , reviewed by an independent reading group , and finalized in a consensus meeting. Audiometry should be performed in an acoustically controlled environment ( < 30dBA); audiometer calibration should be regularly checked; and patient-specific masking rules should be systematically applied. It should be ensured that masking is not overmasking. Adult pure-tone audiometry data should be interpreted taking account of clinical data , speech audiometry and impedancemetry. In case of discrepancies between clinical and pure-tone and speech audiometry data , objective auditory tests should be perform. In children aged 2 years or younger , subjective audiometry should be associated to behavioral audiometry adapted to the child 's age. In suspected hearing impairment , behavioral audiometry should be systematically supplemented by objective hearing tests to determine and confirm the level and type of hearing impairment.
