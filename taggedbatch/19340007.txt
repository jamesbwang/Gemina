 Lung cancer is the main cancer killer in both men and women , mostly due to the rapid development of drug resistant metastatic disease. Here , we evaluate the potential involvement of SRC family kinases ( SFK) in lung cancer biology and assess the possible benefits of their inhibition as a therapeutic approach. We demonstrated that various SRC family members , including LYN and LCK , normally expressed solely in hematopoietic cells and neural tissues , are overexpressed and activated in a panel of SCLC and NSCLC cell lines. This was clinically relevant as LYN and FYN are also overexpressed in lung cancer clinical specimens. Moreover , LYN overexpression correlated with decreased patient survival on univariate and multivariate analysis. Dasatinib ( BMS-354825) , a SRC/ABL inhibitor , effectively blocked SFK activation at nanomolar concentrations which correlated with a significant decrease in cell numbers of multiple lung cancer cell lines. This effect was matched by a decrease in DNA synthesis , but only moderate induction of apoptosis. Indeed , dasatinib as well as PP2 , another SFK inhibitor , strongly induced autophagy that likely prevented apoptosis. However , inhibition of this autophagic response induced robust apoptosis and sensitised lung cancer cells to dasatinib
