 Stroke often involves primary motor cortex ( M1) and its corticospinal projections ( CST). As hand function is critically dependent on these structures , its recovery is often incomplete. The neuronal substrate supporting affected hand function is not well understood but likely involves reorganized M1 and CST of the lesioned hemisphere ( M1 We hypothesized that affected hand function in chronic stroke is related to structural and functional reorganization of M1 We tested 18 patients with chronic ischemic stroke involving M1 or CST. Their hand function was compared to 18 age matched healthy subjects. M1 MEPmax of M1 The results indicate that employed M1
