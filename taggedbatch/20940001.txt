 BACKGROUND Previous studies suggested that inhibition of apoptosis prevents the dysfunction of ischemia-reperfusion injury. In the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion injury , JNK/ERK1/2 and p38 play an essential role in regulation of cell apoptosis. Electroacupuncture ( EA) , a form of acupuncture , has demonstrated superiority in preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury , but the underlying mechanism is unclear. In the present study , we explored the effects of electroacupuncture at Shenting ( GV24) and Baihui ( GV20) acupoints on focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion ( MCAO) rats , and explored whether JNK/ERK1/2- and p38-mediated cell apoptosis are involved. MATERIAL AND METHODS The rats were divided into a sham operation control group , an ischemia group , and an electroacupuncture group with acupuncture applied for 10 days ( 30 min per day). TTC staining was used to calculate the ischemic brain volume. TUNEL staining and transmission electron microscopy were used to detect cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis and Bio-Plex were used to detect JNK , p38 , ERK1/2 , Bcl-2 , and Bax protein expression. RESULTS We found that electroacupuncture at day 10 significantly reduced cerebral infarction. In addition , electroacupuncture suppressed activation of JNK and p38 , while enhancing the activation of ERK1/2 in the peri-ischemic regions. Consequently , the effect of electroacupuncture on these pathways resulted in the inhibition of apoptosis , which was demonstrated by TUNEL and transmission electron microscopy. We found that electroacupuncture upregulated the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2/ Bax ratio in peri-ischemic regions. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that inhibition of cell apoptosis via regulating multiple signaling pathways might be a mechanism whereby electroacupuncture has a positive therapeutic effect on post-stroke impairment.
