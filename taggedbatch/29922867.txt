 Intracranial aneurysms<disease> at the posterior communicating artery ( PCOM) are known to have high rupture rates compared to other locations. We developed and internally validated a statistical model discriminating between ruptured and unruptured PCOM aneurysms<disease> based on hemodynamic and geometric parameters , angio-architectures , and patient age with the objective of its future use for aneurysm<disease> risk assessment. A total of 289 PCOM aneurysms<disease> in 272 patients modeled with image-based computational fluid dynamics ( CFD) were used to construct statistical models using logistic group lasso regression. These models were evaluated with respect to discrimination power and goodness of fit using tenfold nested cross-validation and a split-sample approach to mimic external validation. The final model retained maximum and minimum wall shear stress ( WSS) , mean parent artery WSS , maximum and minimum oscillatory shear index , shear concentration index , and aneurysm<disease> peak flow velocity , along with aneurysm<disease> height and width , bulge location , non-sphericity index , mean Gaussian curvature , angio-architecture type , and patient age. The corresponding area under the curve ( AUC) was 0.8359. When omitting data from each of the three largest contributing hospitals in turn , and applying the corresponding model on the left-out data , the AUCs were 0.7507 , 0.7081 , and 0.5842 , respectively. Statistical models based on a combination of patient age , angio-architecture , hemodynamics , and geometric characteristics can discriminate between ruptured and unruptured PCOM aneurysms<disease> with an AUC of 84 %. It is important to include data from different hospitals to create models of aneurysm<disease> rupture that are valid across hospital populations.
