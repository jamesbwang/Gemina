 Cadmium contamination of environment is a subject of serious international concern. Bioaccumulation of cadmium occurs primarily through ingestion of contaminated water and food. Cadmium poisoning<disease> came into prominence with the `` itai-itai '' disease event in Japan in the 1950s. It could also cause damages to liver , kidney , lung and other organs. Thus , the treatment of cadmium poisoning<disease> has become a research hotspot. Researchers are trying their best to explore prophylactic and therapeutic medicines for prevention and treatment of cadmium-induced poisoning<disease>. So far , chelation therapy , the conventional treatment for heavy metal toxicity , is reported to have a number of safety and efficacy issues. Natural medicines have a variety of advantages such as extensive sources , high safety , less adverse reactions , and thus have great potentials in treating cadmium poisoning<disease>. In this review , the progress in the antagonistic effects of natural drugs in cadmium poisoning<disease> and their therapeutic mechanisms were summarized in order to provide certain references for the future development and in-depth study of antagonistic substances.
