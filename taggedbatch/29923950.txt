 It has recently been proposed that an infraclavicular brachial plexus block ( BPB) at the costoclavicular ( CC) space may overcome some of the limitations of the lateral sagittal ( LS) approach. In this study , we hypothesized that the CC approach will produce faster onset of sensory blockade of the 4 major terminal nerves of the brachial plexus than the LS approach. Forty patients undergoing elective upper extremity surgery under a BPB were randomized to receive either the LS ( Gp-LS , n = 20) or CC approach ( Gp-CC , n = 20) for infraclavicular BPB. Twenty-five milliliters of 0.5 % ropivacaine was used for the BPB in both study groups. Sensory-motor blockade of the ipsilateral median , radial , ulnar , and musculocutaneous nerves was assessed by a blinded observer at regular intervals for 45 minutes after the block. Sensory block was assessed using a verbal rating scale ( 0-100) and motor block using a 3-point qualitative scale ( 0-2). Onset of sensory ( primary outcome variable) and motor blockade was defined as the time it took to achieve a sensory verbal rating scale of 30 or less and motor grade of 1 or less , respectively. Time to readiness for surgery was defined as the time it took to achieve a sensory score of 30 or less and motor grade of 1 or less in all the 4 nerves tested. The overall sensory onset time ( median ( interquartile range)) was significantly faster ( P = 0.004) in Gp-CC ( 10 ( 10-26.25) minutes) than in Gp-LS ( 20 ( 15-30) minutes). The overall sensory score was significantly lower in Gp-CC than in Gp-LS at 5 ( P < 0.001) , 10 ( P = 001) , 15 ( P = 0.001) , and 20 ( P = 0.04) minutes after the BPB. The overall motor score was significantly lower ( P = 0.009) in Gp-CC than in Gp-LS at 10 minutes after the BPB. There were more ( P = 0.04) patients with complete sensory-motor blockade at 20 minutes after the BPB in Gp-CC ( 25 %) than in Gp-LS ( 0 %). Time to readiness for surgery was also significantly faster ( P = 0.002) in Gp-CC ( 10 ( 10-26.5) minutes) than in Gp-LS ( 20 ( 15-30) minutes). The CC approach for infraclavicular BPB produces faster onset of sensory blockade and earlier readiness for surgery than the LS approach.
