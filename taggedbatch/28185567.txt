 This paper presents a data analysis framework to uncover relationships between health conditions , age and sex for a large population of patients. We study a massive heterogeneous sample of 1.7 million patients in Brazil , containing 47 million of health records with detailed medical conditions for visits to medical facilities for a period of 17 months. The findings suggest that medical conditions can be grouped into clusters that share very distinctive densities in the ages of the patients. For each cluster , we further present the ICD-10 chapters within it. Finally , we relate the findings to comorbidity networks , uncovering the relation of the discovered clusters of age densities to comorbidity networks literature.
