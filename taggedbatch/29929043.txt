 Acrofrontofacionasal Dysostosis type 1 ( AFFND1) is an extremely rare , autosomal recessive syndrome<disease><symptom> , comprising facial and skeletal abnormalities , short stature and intellectual disability. We analyzed an Indian family with two affected siblings by exome sequencing and identified a novel homozygous truncating mutation in the Neuroblastoma-Amplified Sequence ( NBAS) gene in the patients ' genome. Mutations in the NBAS gene have recently been associated with different phenotypes mainly involving skeletal formation , liver and cognitive development. The NBAS protein has been implicated in two key cellular processes , namely the non-sense mediated decay and the Golgi-to-Endoplasmic Reticulum retrograde traffic. Both functions were impaired in HEK293T cells overexpressing the truncated NBAS protein , as assessed by Real-Time PCR , Western blot analysis , co-immunoprecipitation , and immunofluorescence analysis. We examined the expression of NBAS protein in mouse embryos at various developmental stages by immunohistochemistry , and detected expression in developing chondrogenic and osteogenic structures of the skeleton as well as in the cortex , hippocampus and cerebellum , which is compatible with a role in bone and brain development. Functional genetics in the zebrafish model showed that depletion of endogenous z-nbas in fish embryos results in defective morphogenesis of chondrogenic cranial skeletal elements. Overall , our data point to a conserved function of NBAS in skeletal morphogenesis during development , support the hypothesis of a causative role of the mutated NBAS gene in the pathogenesis of AFFND1 and extend the spectrum of phenotypes associated with defects in this gene.
