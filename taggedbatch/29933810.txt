 Lateral anterior column release ( ACR) is a powerful extension of the minimally invasive lateral lumbar interbody fusion procedure that incorporates division of the anterior longitudinal ligament to allow manipulation of the anterior and middle spinal columns. The resulting surgical control permits restoration of significant segmental lordosis that , when combined with varying posterior column releases , can achieve global sagittal realignment on par with traditional 3-column osteotomies. As a result , ACR is a factor in the growth of minimally invasive strategies for the correction of spinal deformities.
