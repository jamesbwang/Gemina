 Allosteric proteins transmit a mechanical signal induced by binding a ligand. However , understanding the nature of the information transmitted and the architectures optimizing such transmission remains a challenge. Here we show , using an in silico evolution scheme and theoretical arguments , that architectures optimized to be cooperative , which efficiently propagate energy , qualitatively differ from previously investigated materials optimized to propagate strain. Although we observe a large diversity of functioning cooperative architectures ( including shear , hinge , and twist designs) , they all obey the same principle of displaying a mechanism , i.e. , an extended soft mode. We show that its optimal frequency decreases with the spatial extension L of the system as L
