 Antidepressant medication influences cellular lipogenesis , being associated with metabolic side effects including weight gain. Due to the increasing use of antidepressants in children and adolescents , their metabolic and endocrine adverse effects are of particular concern , especially within this pediatric population that appears to be at greater risk. Genetic factors with a possible influence on antidepressant 's adverse effects include CYP ( cytochrome P450 ( CYP450)) polymorphisms. We target to evaluate the efficacy of the pharmacogenetic testing , when prescribing antidepressants , in correlation with the occurrence of adverse events and weight gain. Our research was performed between the years 2010 and 2016 , in the University Clinic of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry , Timisoara , Romania. We recruited 80 patients , children and adolescents with depressive disorders. Our study sample was divided in two groups: G1- 40 patients took treatment after pharmacogenetic testing , and G2- 40 patients without pharmacogenetic testing before the treatment election. Our results show statistically significant differences concerning the weight gain for groups G1 ( with pharmacogenetic testing) and G2 ( without pharmacogenetic testing). The CYP genotype and the pharmacogenetic testing , for choosing the personalized antidepressant therapy in children and adolescents with depressive disorders , proved to be good predictors for the response to antidepressants and the side effects registered , especially for weight gain. The significant correlations between the CYP polymorphisms for group G2 ( without pharmacogenetic testing) and the weight gain/body mass index ( BMI) increase , as major side effects induced by antidepressants , proved the fact that the pharmacogenetic screening is needed in the future clinical practice , allowing for individualized , tailored treatment , especially for at-risk pediatric categories.
