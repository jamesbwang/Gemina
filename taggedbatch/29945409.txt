 To compare the efficacy of Kirschner wire tension band with hole and common Kirschner wire tension band in the treatment of olecranon fractures in adults , so as to guide the selection of clinical surgical procedures. From July 2011 to October 2015 , a total of 49 patients with olecranon fractures underwent open reduction and fixation with Kirschner wire tension band , which were retrospectively analyzed. Of the 49 patients , 21 patients ( group A) were treated with Kirschner wire tension band with hole , including 12 males and 9 females , with an average age of ( 37.6 ± 8.2) years old; 28 patients ( group B) were treated with common Kirschner wire , including 18 males and 10 females , with an average age of ( 38.9 ± 7.3) years old. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in general data. The differences of operative duration , frequency of radiation , fracture healing time , complications and postoperative elbow function scores between the two groups were observed and analyzed by parallel statistical analysis. In group A , the operative duration was ( 60.4 ± 10.7) min , the average number of radiation times was ( 12.5 ± 2.9); in group B , the operative duration was ( 62.3 ± 11.8) min , and the average radiation times was ( 13.7 ± 3.8); there was no significant difference in operative time and radiation times between the two groups ( P > 0.05). In group A , the fracture healing time was ( 13.2 ± 2.6) weeks without K-wire migration , skin irritation and other complications; and fracture healing time in group B was ( 14.6 ± 1.8) weeks with complications ( K-wire migration in 6 cases , skin irritation in 7 cases , internal fixation failure in 2 cases); the fracture healing time of group A was shorter than that in group B. Evaluation of elbow joint function in two groups of patients after operation showed that in group A , pain score was 41.0 ± 3.5 , movement function score was 18.0 ± 2.1 , stability score was 9.0 ± 0.8 , daily activities score was 18.0 ± 4.3 , the total average score was 87.0 ± 7.8; and in group B , the pain score was 39.0 ± 5.6 , movement function score was 17.0 ± 3.2 , the stability score was 8.0 ± 2.4 , daily activities score was 16.0 ± 5.2 , the total average score was 83.0 ± 10.7. There were no statistically significant in the scores between the two groups. Compared with ordinary Kirschner wire , the treatment of olecranon fracture with Kirschner tension band with hole can shorten the time of fracture healing , significantly reduce the occurrence of complications , and do not affect the recovery of postoperative function , which is suitable for clinical use.
