 Bioremediation is a strategy to mitigate environmental impacts of hazardous pollutants from anthropogenic sources. Natural byproducts , including agroindustrial wastes ( AW) can be used to induce enzyme biosynthesis , leading up to enhancement of pollutants degradation process. Therefore , this study aimed to evaluate the use of cupuaçu , Theobroma grandiflorum AW as Pycnoporus sanguineus<pathogen> Laccase ( Lac) inducer in order to promote 17-α-ethinylestradiol ( EE2) bioremediation. The macro and micro-nutrients levels of cupuaçu AWs were evaluated in order to establish further correlations with enzymatic biosynthesis induction. The fungus was cultivated for 7 days in temperature of 28 ± 2 °C and agitation of 150 rpm. For bioremediation , Lac enzymatic extract was added to EE2 solution ( 10 µg mL
