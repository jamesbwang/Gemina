 The Gram-negative bacterium<pathogen> Vibrio<pathogen> cholerae<pathogen><disease> is a unique pathogen with an ability to colonize human intestine as well as outside environments. The biofilm , an organized polymeric structure produced by this bacterium<pathogen> known to be a significant factor for the survival and persistence in hostile conditions. However , the direct role of biofilm formation by this bacterium<pathogen> in environmental persistence , in vivo colonization , and pathogenesis remains unexplored. In this study , we have generated biofilm-altered Tn5 mutants of V.<pathogen> cholerae O139<pathogen> and evaluated their in vivo colonization ability on mouse model. These Tn5 mutants were found to harbor an independent , single Tn5 insertion in their genome. The DNA sequence analysis revealed that genomic region wherein Tn5 insertion occurred is identified to be involved in functions like LPS biosynthesis , efflux transporters , motility , purine metabolism , stringent response , VPS synthesis , and a hypothetical protein of unknown function. In single-strain infection with the planktonic culture , the biofilm-altered as well as the biofilm intermediate mutants were found to be more or less similar in their intestinal colonization ability , however infection with their biofilm form , a marked difference was observed between the biofilm deficient and other biofilm forming strains. Further , in the competition experiments , biofilm deficient and proficient mutants were found reduced in their colonization ability and outcompeted by their parent strain. In conclusion , biofilm formation in V.<pathogen> cholerae O139<pathogen> is a genetically complex process and the controlled and regulated production of biofilm appeared to be necessary for its efficient colonization of mouse intestine.
