 Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) affects 10 % of people older than 65 and is characterized by a progressive<symptom> loss<symptom> of cognitive function with an abnormal accumulation of amyloid β ( Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles ( NFT) in the brain. Efforts to reduce brain Aβ plaques continue to be investigated as a therapeutic approach for AD. We report here development of dual targeting agents with affinity for Aβ plaque/P-glycoprotein ( Pgp) and Aβ plaque/α4β 2 * nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChR). These novel dual agents may be able to efflux Aβ plaques via the paravascular ( glymphatic) pathways. Ferulic acid ( FA) , ferulic acid ethyl ester ( FAEE) , and curcumin ( CUR) were used for Aβ plaques , fexofenadine ( FEX) was used as substrate for Pgp and nifrolidine ( NIF) was used for α4β 2 * nAChRs. Aβ plaque/α4β 2 * nAChR dual agent , FA-NIF ( GKS-007) exhibited IC
