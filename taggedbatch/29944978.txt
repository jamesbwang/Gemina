 The human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER) family consists of four transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases: epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) , HER2 , HER3 , and HER4. They are part of a complex signalling network and stimulate intracellular pathways regulating cell growth and differentiation. So far , monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs) and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting EGFR and HER2 have been developed and approved. Recently , focus has turned to HER3 as it may play an important role in resistance to EGFR- and HER2-targeting therapies. HER3-targeting agents have been undergoing clinical evaluation for the last 10 years and currently thirteen mAbs are in phase 1 or 2 clinical studies. Single agent activity has proven to be limited , however , the tolerability was favourable. Thus , combinations of HER3-binding mAbs with other HER-targeting therapies or chemotherapies have been pursued in various solid tumor entities. Data indicate that the HER3-binding ligand heregulin may serve as a response prediction marker for HER3-targeting therapy. Within this review the current status of clinical development of HER3-targeting compounds is described.
