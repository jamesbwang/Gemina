 Crohn 's disease ( CD) is a chronic , recurring , idiopathic disease which is associated with imbalanced mucosal immune response , manifesting as a chronic inflammation<symptom> of any location throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The purpose of currently available therapy is to suppress the heightened immune response. However , these treatments have no direct influence on the healing process of damaged tissues. The mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC) therapy may represent a new alternative solution in both luminal and fistulizing CD , as it is able to inhibit the inflammation<symptom> and promote the regeneration process at the same time. Areas covered: Aim of this review is to summarize the existing clinical data about the clinical impact of MSC therapy in luminal and perianal fistulizing CD. Expert opinion: Clinical trials demonstrated that MSC transplantation has an outstanding , durable efficacy with low fistula<disease> recurrence in biological therapy-refractory fistulizing CD; however , further clinical trials are required to confirm its effectiveness in luminal CD. Unlike to biological therapy , MSCs are able to promote the regeneration process of damaged tissues as well. This additional benefit besides their sustained immunosuppressive effect with no decrease of efficiency over time makes MSCs a new , highly potential therapeutic approach in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.
