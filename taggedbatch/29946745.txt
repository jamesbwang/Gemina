 Microalgae could be of importance for future biodiesel production as an alternative for a third generation of biofuels. To select the most appropriate strain for biodiesel production , three microalgae species , namely Isochrysis sp. , Nannochloropsis maritima and Tetraselmis sp. , isolated from Tunisian coast , were biochemically characterized. Initially , gas chromatography analysis showed that Isochrysis sp. and N. maritima contained 5- and 10-fold total fatty acids , respectively , more than Tetraselmis sp.. Then , the two microalgae Isochrysis sp. and N. maritima were subject to random mutagenesis using ultraviolet-C radiation. Subsequently , a total of 18 mutants were obtained from both species. The neutral lipid evaluation on said 18 mutants allowed the retention of only 7 to further fatty acid characterization. Finally , gas chromatography revealed that the mutant 5c Isochrysis sp. was characterized by a high level of saturated fatty acids ( 52.3 %) , higher amount of monounsaturated fatty acids ( 29.3 %) , lower level of polyunsaturated fatty acids ( 18.4 %) and a significant 1.3-fold increase in its C16-C18 content compared to the wild-type strain , which would make it an interesting candidate for biofuel production.
