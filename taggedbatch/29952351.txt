 Chemotherapy is one of the main treatments for ovarian cancer ( OC). Cisplatin combined with paclitaxel is a commonly used chemotherapy regimen. However , effective cancer therapy is hindered by a patient 's resistance to cisplatin. The mechanism that potentially leads to that resistance is unclear. The current study examined the mechanism by which Linc00312 is involved in resistance to cisplatin in OC. Quantitative real-time PCR ( RT-qPCR) was used to test for expression of Linc00312 in freshly frozen tissue samples of OC and in SKOV3 and SKOV3/DDP cells. In situ hybridization was performed to examine the distribution of Linc00312 expression in paraffin-embedded histological sections that were sensitive or resistant to cisplatin. The cell counting kit-8 assay was used to detect cell viability. Flow cytometry was used to measure cell apoptosis. RT-qPCR was performed to confirm changes in expression of MDR1 , MRP1 , Bcl-2 , Bax , Caspase-3 , and Caspase-9 mRNA. Levels of MDR1 , Bcl-2 , Bax , Caspase-3 , and Caspase-9 protein were detected with Western blotting. Experiments indicated that the expression of Linc00312 decreased significantly in SKOV3/DDP cells compared to that in SKOV3 cells. Upregulation of Linc00312 can considerably increase the sensitivity of SKOV3/DDP cells to cisplatin , while down-regulation of Linc00312 has the exact opposite effect in SKOV3 cells. Linc00312 enhanced the sensitivity of SKOV3/DDP cells to cisplatin by promoting cell apoptosis via the Bcl-2/ Caspase-3 signaling pathway. These findings suggest that Linc00312 may be a promising clinical strategy for the treatment of drug-resistant OC.
