 Food allergy ( FA) affects the daily lives of children and parents in varying degrees. The Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire-Parent Form ( FAQLQ-PF) is a valid and reliable instrument to assess the quality of life ( QoL) of children from parents ' perception. The aim of this study was to validate and determine the reliability of the Turkish FAQLQ-PF and to assess QoL in food-allergic children. Children aged between 0 and 12 years and diagnosed with immunoglobulin E ( IgE)- mediated FA for at least 1 month were enrolled. The English FAQLQ-PF was translated into Turkish according to the World Health Organization guidelines. The Food Allergy Independent Measure and the Turkish Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form 50 were used for construct validity. One hundred and fifty-seven patients participated. The median age of patients and FA duration were 2.4 years ( 1.2-5.2 years , interquartile-ranges) and 2 years ( 0.8-5.1) , respectively. Ninety-six ( 61.1 %) patients had anaphylaxis. The Cronbach 's alpha coefficient and intra-class correlation coefficient for test-retest reliability was good for all age groups of children ( < 4 , 4-6 , and 7-12 years). Patients with either asthma or anaphylaxis had worse scores than others. Total scores of FAQLQ-PF tended to increase with age. Patients aged 7-12 had the highest total scores among all patients ( 2.2 ± 0.1 , 3.0 ± 0.2 , and 3.3 ± 0.3 for < 4 , 4-6 , and 7-12 years , respectively , P < 0.001 , P for trend < 0.001). Other factors causing the poor QoL were cow 's milk allergy , sibling allergy , mother 's age over 30 years , mother 's high education level and lower number of persons in household. The Turkish FAQLQ-PF is a valid and reliable scale. FA-related QoL was significantly worse with age. Coexistent asthma , anaphylaxis regardless of its severity , cow 's milk allergy , sibling allergy and the older and educated mothers seem to poorly affect QoL.
