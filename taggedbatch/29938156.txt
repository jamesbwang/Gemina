 Ionospheric signatures of ultra-low frequency ( ULF) wave in the Pc3-5 band ( 1.7-40.0 mHz) were surveyed using ~ 6 s resolution data from Super Dual Auroral Radar Network ( SuperDARN) radars in the northern hemisphere from 2010 to 2016. Numerical experiments were conducted to derive wave period dependent thresholds for automated detection of ULF waves using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram technique. The spatial occurrence distribution , frequency characteristics , seasonal effects , solar wind condition and geomagnetic activity level dependence have been studied. Pc5 wave events were found to dominate at high and polar latitudes with a most probable frequency of 2.08 ± 0.07 mHz while Pc3-4 waves were relatively more common at midlatitudes on the nightside with a most probable frequency of 11.39 ± 0.14 mHz. At high latitudes , the occurrence rate of Pc4-5 waves maximizes in the dusk sector and during winter. These events tend to occur during low geomagnetic activity and northward interplanetary magnetic field ( IMF). For the category of radially bounded but longitudinally extended Pc4 events in the duskside ionosphere , an internal driving source is suggested. At midlatitudes , the Pc3-4 occurrence rate maximizes premidnight and during equinox. This tendency becomes more prominent with increasing auroral electrojet ( AE) index and during southward IMF , which suggests many of these events are Pi2 and Pc3-4 pulsations associated with magnetotail dynamics during active geomagnetic intervals. The overall occurrence rate of Pc3-5 wave events is lowest in summer , which suggests that the ionospheric conductivity plays a role in controlling ULF wave occurrence.
