 Lysine demethylase 3A ( KDM3A) , also known as JMJD1A , has been associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in several cancer types , including renal cell carcinoma , prostate cancer and Ewing sarcoma<disease>. However , little is known regarding the clinicopathological significance of KDM3A expression in breast cancer ( BCa). To investigate the clinical relevance of KDM3A expression in the setting of BCa , immunohistochemistry was performed on a tissue microarray consisting of 150 commercially available BCa samples. No significant correlation was identified between KDM3A expression and various clinicopathological variables , including clinical stage , pathological grade , tumor size and the expression statuses of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 , estrogen receptor , and progesterone receptor. In addition , no significant association between KDM3A expression and overall prognosis was observed. Taken together , these findings suggest that there is no significant association between KDM3A expression and clinicopathological variables , indicating that KDM3A may not be associated with the malignant behavior of BCa.
