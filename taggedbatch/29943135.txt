 There is no consensus as to the effects of epidural analgesia on postoperative outcomes after laparoscopy in the context of the Enhanced Recovery Programs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of epidural analgesia on postoperative outcomes after elective laparoscopic sigmoidectomy. The use of epidural analgesia was discontinued in elective laparoscopic sigmoidectomy and substituted by the perioperative administration of systemic lidocaine. Data from patients undergoing elective laparoscopic sigmoidectomy between January 2014 and September 2016 was prospectively analysed. Patients with epidural analgesia were compared with patients without , in analgesics administrated postoperatively , length of stay , day of first defecation and mobilisation , and complication and reoperation rates. A total of 160 patients ( male 85; female 75) , median age 68 ( 30-92 years) , were included. The groups consisted of 80 patients each. Mean length of stay ( 5.6 vs. 7.2 days , p = 0.03) and day of first mobilisation ( mean 1.2 vs. 1.6 days , p = 0.004) were significantly shorter in the group without epidural analgesia. Reoperation rate ( 7.5 vs. 2.5 %) was not statistically different. Complication rate was significantly lower ( 12.5 vs. 30 % , p = 0.007) in the group without epidural. Day of first defecation was shorter in the epidural group ( 1.4 vs. 1.7 days , p = 0.04). Mean amount of analgesics administrated was not statistically different between groups , except for metamizole , that was administrated more in the group without epidural. Epidural analgesia did not offer benefits on postoperative analgesia or outcomes after elective laparoscopic sigmoidectomy , causing longer length of stay , later mobilisation and higher complication rate.
