 Cardiorespiratory arrest can result in a spectrum of hypoxic ischemic brain injury leading to global hypoperfusion and brain death ( BD). Because up to 40 % of patients with BD are viable organ donors , avoiding delayed diagnosis of this condition is critical. High b-value diffusion weighted imaging ( DWI) measures primarily molecular self-diffusion; however , low b-values are sensitive to perfusion. We investigated the feasibility of low b-value DWI in discriminating the global hypoperfusion of BD and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE). We retrospectively reviewed cardiorespiratory arrest subjects with a diagnosis of HIE or BD. Inclusion criteria included brain DWI acquired at both low ( 50 s/mm We evaluated 64 patients ( 45 with cardiorespiratory arrest and 19 normal). Cardiorespiratory arrest patients with BD had markedly lower mean b50 ADC in gray matter regions compared with HIE ( 0.70 ± 0.18 vs. 1.95 ± 0.25 × 10 Low b-value DWI is promising for the discrimination of HIE with maintained perfusion and brain death in cardiorespiratory arrest.
