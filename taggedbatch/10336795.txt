 Besides sensory characteristics of food , food-evoked emotion is a crucial factor in predicting consumer 's food preference and therefore in developing new products. Many measures have been developed to assess food-evoked emotions. The aim of this literature review is ( i) to give an exhaustive overview of measures used in current research and ( ii) to categorize these methods along measurement level ( physiological , behavioral , and cognitive) and emotional processing level ( unconscious sensory , perceptual/early cognitive , and conscious/decision making) level. This 3 Ã— 3 categorization may help researchers to compile a set of complementary measures ( `` toolbox '') for their studies. We included 101 peer-reviewed articles that evaluate consumer 's emotions and were published between 1997 and 2016 , providing us with 59 different measures. More than 60 % of these measures are based on self-reported , subjective ratings and questionnaires ( cognitive measurement level) and assess the conscious/decision-making level of emotional processing. This multitude of measures and their overrepresentation in a single category hinders the comparison of results across studies and building a complete multi-faceted picture of food-evoked emotions. We recommend ( 1) to use widely applied , validated measures only , ( 2) to refrain from using ( highly correlated) measures from the same category but use measures from different categories instead , preferably covering all three emotional processing levels , and ( 3) to acquire and share simultaneously collected physiological , behavioral , and cognitive datasets to improve the predictive power of food choice and other models.
