 The objective of this study was to implement a follower load ( FL) device within a robotic ( universal force-moment sensor) testing system and utilize the system to explore the effect of FL on multi-segment cervical spine moment-rotation parameters and intradiscal pressure ( IDP) at C45 and C56. Twelve fresh-frozen human cervical specimens ( C3-C7) were biomechanically tested in a robotic testing system to a pure moment target of 2.0 Nm for flexion and extension ( FE) with no compression and with 100 N of FL.. Application of FL was accomplished by loading the specimens with bilateral cables passing through cable guides inserted into the vertebral bodies and attached to load controlled linear actuators. FL significantly increased neutral zone ( NZ) stiffness and NZ width but resulted in no change in the range of motion ( ROM) or elastic zone stiffness. C45 and C56 IDP measured in the neutral position were significantly increased with application of FL.. The change in IDP with increasing flexion rotation was not significantly affected by the application of FL , whereas the change in IDP with increasing extension rotation was significantly reduced by the application of FL.. Application of FL did not appear to affect the specimen 's quantity of motion ( ROM) but did affect the quality ( the shape of the curve). Regarding IDP , the effects of adding FL compression approximates the effect of the patient going from supine to a seated position ( FL compression increased the IDP in the neutral position). The change in IDP with increasing flexion rotation was not affected by the application of FL , but the change in IDP with increasing extension rotation was , however , significantly reduced by the application of FL..
