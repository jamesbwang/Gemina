 Providing a subset of previously studied items as retrieval cues can both impair and improve memory for the remaining items. Here , we investigated such part-list cuing effects in younger and older adults ' episodic recall , using listwise directed forgetting to manipulate study context access at test. When context access was maintained , part-list cuing impaired recall regardless of age. In contrast , when context access was impaired , part-list cuing improved recall in younger but not in older adults. The results are consistent with the proposal that older adults show intact inhibition and blocking of competing information , but reduced capability for episodic context reactivation.
