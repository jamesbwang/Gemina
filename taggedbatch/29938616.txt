 Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori ( H.<pathogen> pylori)- related gastric diseases are a series of gastric mucosal disorders associated with H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection , including chronic gastritis<disease> , gastric ulcer<disease><symptom> and gastric cancer ( GC) etc.. The formation of GC is widely believed to be a multistep process , evolving from gastritis<disease> and gastric ulcer<disease><symptom>. Thus , to explore the mechanisms of gastric mucosa from benign to malignant pathological evolution process is the crux of prevention and treatment of GC. As an important adhesion molecule of epithelial cells , E-cadherin plays a key role in the development of gastric diseases. In this review , we provide an overview about the relationship of E-cadherin and H.<pathogen> pylori , and the role of E-cadherin in chronic gastritis<disease> , gastric ulcer<disease><symptom> , gastric precancerous lesions<symptom> and GC , aiming to seek the characteristic of E-cadherin expression at different stages of gastric diseases.
