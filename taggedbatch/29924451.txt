 CDX2 is routinely used for identifying gastrointestinal origin of metastatic adenocarcinomas; but a high percentage of other carcinomas also show positivity with this antibody. SATB2 is a new immunohistochemical marker with a few studies showing that it is specifically expressed in a large majority of colorectal adenocarcinomas. We assessed SATB2 along with CDX2 in patient material with metastasis in order to determine whether the primary site could be identified as ` colon-rectum '. Metastasis in 67 liver biopsies , 108 lymph nodes from resection specimens and 36 serous effusions<symptom> was analyzed retrospectively. Blinded slides stained for CDX2 and SATB2 were assessed individually by two pathologists and sensitivity , specificity and kappa statistics were calculated. Sensitivity for CDX2 in metastasis from colorectal adenocarcinomas was 93 %; while in SATB2 it was 79 %. The combination of CDX2 and SATB2 yielded a sensitivity of 79 % and a high specificity of 93 %. There was an acceptable level of agreement ( Îº = 0.64) between the pathologists for both the markers in case of colorectal adenocarcinoma metastasis. CDX2 is a sensitive marker compared to SATB2; while the specificity of combination of CDX2 and SATB2 is high for metastasis from colorectal adenocarcinoma. SATB2 can be used as a supplementary marker along with CDX2 to identify colorectal origin for material received from patients clinically presenting with metastasis.
