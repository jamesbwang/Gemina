 The Role Checklist is used by occupational therapists across the globe. Developed in 1981 and consistent with the Model of Human Occupation ( MOHO) , until recently , the Role Checklist was not updated. This is of concern as the Role Checklist originally was established to measure role performance. In 2008 , Kielhofner , in the fourth edition of A Model of Human Occupation , differentiated occupational performance in 10 roles which clearly fall into occupational participation in the Role Checklist Version 3. The objective of the study was to describe changes and establish utility , feasibility , and reliability of the Role Checklist Version 3. The Role Checklist Version 3 was administered electronically to N = 114 occupational therapists and students. A short time span was used due to sensitivity to history bias. Test-retest reliability using Cohen 's Kappa and Cronbach 's alpha mirrored analysis done on the original version. Qualitatively , nine themes emerged regarding utility and feasibility. Test-retest reliability is acceptable to excellent for present role incumbency ( κ = 0.74-1.00) , desired future role engagement ( κ = 0.44-1.00) , and satisfaction with performance ( α = 0.77-0.98). Participants ( 91 %) found it useful for treatment planning and 75 % would recommend Version 3 over the original Role Checklist. Data support the Role Checklist Version 3 as a reliable , electronic instrument feasible for occupational therapists to measure participation.
