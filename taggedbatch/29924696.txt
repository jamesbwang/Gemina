 This study investigated whether commercially available compression garments ( COMP) exerting a moderate level of pressure and/or neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES) accelerate recovery following a cross-country sprint skiing competition compared with a control group ( CON) consisting of active recovery only. Twenty-one senior ( 12 males , 9 females) and 11 junior ( 6 males , 5 females) Swedish national team skiers performed an outdoor sprint skiing competition involving four sprints lasting âˆ¼ 3-4 min. Before the competition , skiers were matched by sex and skiing level ( senior versus junior) and randomly assigned to COMP ( n = 11) , NMES ( n = 11) or CON ( n = 10). Creatine kinase ( CK) , urea , countermovement jump ( CMJ) height , and perceived muscle<symptom> pain<symptom> were measured before and 8 , 20 , 44 and 68 h after competition. Neither COMP nor NMES promoted the recovery of blood biomarkers , CMJ or perceived pain post-competition compared with CON ( all P > .05). When grouping all 32 participants , urea and perceived muscle<symptom> pain<symptom> increased from baseline , peaking at 8 h ( standardised mean difference ( SMD) , ( 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs))): 2.8 ( 2.3 , 3.2)) and 44 h ( odds ratio ( 95 % CI): 3.3 ( 2.1 , 5.1)) post-competition , respectively. Additionally , CMJ was lower than baseline 44 and 68 h post-competition in both males and females ( P < .05). CK increased from baseline in males , peaking at 44 h ( SMD: 1.4 ( -0.4 , 0.9)) , but was decreased in females at 20 h post-competition ( SMD: -0.8 ( -1.4 , -0.2)). In conclusion , cross-country sprint skiing induced symptoms of exercise-induced muscle damage peaking 8-44 h post-competition. However , neither COMP nor NMES promoted physiological or perceptual recovery compared with CON.
