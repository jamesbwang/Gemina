 Erythrovirus B19 ( B19V) is one of the erythroviruses known to be pathogenic in humans. B19V is classified into three distinct genotypes; 1 , 2 and 3 , differing from each other by 2-13 per cent. Genotype 1 consists of the prototype B19V isolates , genotype 2 comprises the A6 , LaLi and their related isolates while genotype 3 includes the V9- and V9-related isolates. The classification of genotype 1 into two subtypes ( 1A and 1B) and genotype 3 into two subtypes ( 3a and 3b) with an estimated nucleotide difference of about 5 per cent has been done. Predominance of genotype 1 across all the continents is seen followed by genotypes 2 and 3. There are no disease-specific genotypes. All the three genotypes have been found in symptomatic as well as asymptomatic individuals and have been reported from several countries across the world. The prevalence of genotype 2 in older populations and its absence from current circulation in Northern Europe has also been reported. The present review focuses on geographic distribution and association of genotypes of B19V with different clinical manifestations.
