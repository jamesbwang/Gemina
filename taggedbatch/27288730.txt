 Elucidating molecular alterations due to mitochondrial Complex I ( CI) mutations may help to understand CI deficiency ( CID) , not only in mitochondriopathies but also as it is caused by drugs or associated to many diseases. CID metabolic expression was investigated in Leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy ( LHON) caused by an inherited mutation of CI. NMR-based metabolomics analysis was performed in intact skin fibroblasts from LHON patients. It used several datasets: one-dimensional LHON fibroblasts had decreased CI activity (- 43 % , p < 0.01). Metabolomics revealed prominent alterations in LHON including the increase of fatty acids ( FA) , polyunsaturated FA and phosphatidylcholine with a variable importance in the prediction ( VIP) > 1 in OPLS-DA , p < 0.01 in univariate statistics , and the decrease of amino acids ( AA) , predominantly glycine , glutamate , glutamine ( VIP > 1) and alanine ( VIP > 1 , p < 0.05). In LHON , treatment with IDE and RSV increased CI activity ( + 40 and + 44 % , p < 0.05). IDE decreased FA , polyunsaturated FA and phosphatidylcholine ( p < 0.05) , but did not modified AA levels. RSV decreased polyunsaturated FA , and increased several AA ( VIP > 1 and/or p < 0.05). LHON fibroblasts display lipid and amino acid metabolism alterations that are reversed by mitochondria-targeted treatments , and can be related to adaptive changes. Findings bring insights into molecular changes induced by CI mutation and , beyond , CID of other origins.
