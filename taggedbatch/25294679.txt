 Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) is the sixth most common tumor worldwide. The relationship between the gene methylation accumulation and HCC has been widely studied. In our study , we used the Sequenom EpiTYPER assay to investigate the methylation levels of the RASA3 in 164 HCC samples and paired adjacent non-cancerous tissues , and the association between methylation level and clinicopathological features. The methylation level of the RASA3 in HCC samples was found significantly lower than that in the adjacent non-cancerous tissues ( P < 0.0001). Moreover , the hypomethylation of RASA3 in HCC samples was connected with the presence of tumornecrosis ( P = 0.029) and alcohol intake ( P = 0.002). Furthermore , it was found that the expression of RASA3 was significantly decreased in tumor tissues ( P = 0.0053) , which was also correlated with the methylation levels of RASA3 gene. Thus , RASA3 hypomethylation is a common feature in HCC , and may be a potential mechanism for HCC development , and serves as a useful biomarker for the early detection , especially in alcohol-associated HCCs.
