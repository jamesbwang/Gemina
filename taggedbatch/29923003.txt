 We developed a pyrosequencing protocol for monitoring of stability of attenuating mutations in the genome of vaccine reassortants based on master donor virus of Russian live attenuated influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccine B/USSR/60/ 69. The developed protocol allows rapid and accurate assessment of mutations and can be used for analysis of genetic stability of reassortants during vaccine strain development and manufacturing , as well as genetic stability of vaccine isolates of influenza<pathogen><disease> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> during pre-clinical and clinical trials.
