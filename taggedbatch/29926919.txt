 Tracking eye movements<symptom> is being increasingly recognized as a valuable source of information about stimulus control. So far , however , eye-tracking research has suffered from accessibility issues , with expensive hardware and closed-source software. In this article we review Pupil Â© , an eye-tracking platform developed by Pupil Labs and that combines open-source software with low-cost hardware components. We offer concrete recommendations about Pupil use in stimulus-control research and we show how the software can be extended to automatize the analysis of gaze data. Finally , we present the results of a study of visual discrimination and conditioned reinforcement conducted with Pupil , establishing the usefulness of this platform as a research tool in behavior analysis.
