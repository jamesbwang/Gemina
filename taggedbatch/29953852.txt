 The adult mammalian heart does n't regenerate after cardiomyocyte injury , which was mainly caused by the severe and persistent effects of cardiomyopathy. Recently , some studies reported that the mammalian heart can regenerate under low oxygen environment. However , the mechanism that the mammalian heart can regenerate remains unknown. Here , we used cardiac stem cells ( CSCs) to be planted in serum-free medium under hypoxia environment to understand the mechanism of HIF1α/NDUFA4L2 in the regulation of hypoxia-alleviated apoptosis. Our results revealed that hypoxia can alleviated CSCs apoptosis. Hypoxia inhibited the level of cleaved-caspase3 and stimulated the expression of stabilized HIF-1α. DMOG promotes the survival of CSCs and the protein expression of NDUFA4L2. 2-ME repressed the survival of CSCs and the protein expression of NDUFA4L2. CHIP assay showed that HIF-1α regulated the survival of CSCs by augmenting the combination of HIF-1α and NDUFA4L2 's HRE. Knockdown of NDUFA4L2 reversed the role of hypoxia in the survival of CSCs. Taken together , hypoxia promotes the viability of CSCs in serum-free medium by HIF-1α/ NDUFA4L2 signaling pathway.
