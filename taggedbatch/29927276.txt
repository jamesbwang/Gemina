 Psychological inertia , the process by which social-cognitive variables help maintain behavioral patterns over time , has been found to explain crime continuity. The present study sought to determine whether psychological inertia can also be used to explain continuity in bullying behavior. A group of 1,161 youth ( 567 male) from the Illinois Study of Bullying and Sexual Violence were surveyed 3 times over a period of 1 year in an effort to determine which of two dimensions of precriminal cognition-cognitive insensitivity ( callous , self-serving) or cognitive impulsivity ( reckless , emotional)- mediated the past bullying-future bullying relationship. Consistent with research on crime continuity , cognitive impulsivity mediated bullying continuity , but cognitive insensitivity did not. Congruent with research on psychological inertia and crime continuity , the main reason why cognitive insensitivity did not mediate bullying continuity was that prior bullying behavior failed to predict subsequent cognitive insensitivity. In addition to providing support for a 2-dimensional ( insensitivity , impulsivity) model of bullying development , these results suggest that 1 way bullying behavior can be managed is by challenging and reducing cognitive impulsivity , which in the current study was found to be a major contributor to bullying continuity.
