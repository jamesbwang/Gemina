 Subungual melanoma in situ ( SMIS) is a malignant neoplasm that requires early diagnosis and complete surgical excision; however , little is known about the usefulness of the detailed dermoscopic features of longitudinal melanonychia ( LM) to predict the diagnosis of SMIS. To investigate the characteristic dermoscopic findings of SMIS and to establish a predictive scoring model for the diagnosis of SMIS in patients with adult-onset LM affecting a single digit. A cohort study of 19 patients with biopsy-proven SMIS and 26 patients with benign LM diagnosed in a tertiary referral hospital in Seoul , South Korea , from September 1 , 2013 , to July 31 , 2017. Patient demographics , frequency of specific dermoscopic findings , and a predictive scoring model. Of the total 45 patients with pigmented nails , the 19 patients with SMIS included 14 women and had a mean ( SD) age of 52.0 ( 14.4) years , and the 26 patients with benign LM included 18 women and had a mean ( SD) age of 48.1 ( 13.2) years. Asymmetry ( odds ratio ( OR) , 34.00; 95 % CI , 3.88-297.70) , border fading ( OR , 9.33; 95 % CI , 2.37-36.70) , multicolor ( OR , 11.59; 95 % CI , 2.21-60.89) , width of the pigmentation of at least 3 mm ( OR , 5.31; 95 % CI , 1.01-28.07) , and presence of the Hutchinson sign ( OR , 18.18; 95 % CI , 2.02-163.52) were features of LM that were significantly associated with SMIS. A predictive scoring model incorporating these dermoscopic features of SMIS was assessed. The model , ranging from 0 to 8 points , showed a reliable diagnostic value ( the receiver operating characteristic curve had an area under the curve ( C statistic) of 0.91) in differentiating SMIS from benign LM at a cutoff value of 3 , with a sensitivity of 89 % and a specificity of 62 %. This study suggests characteristic dermoscopic features for SMIS. A predictive scoring model based on these morphologic features may help differentiate SMIS from benign LM.
