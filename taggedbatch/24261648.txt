 Recent legislation extended coverage for assisted reproductive technologies ( ART) to male veterans within the United States Veterans Affairs ( VA) healthcare system. We sought to characterize the appropriateness of male infertility<symptom> diagnosis and access to assisted reproductive technologies ( ART) among men within the local VA healthcare system after passage of the new legislation. We retrospectively identified male patients within the South Florida VA Network who underwent semen analysis ( SA) or were diagnosed with infertility<symptom> between January 1999 and June 2017. Men were classified by infertility<symptom> diagnosis and sperm concentration/mL ( normal , oligospermia < 15 , severe oligospermia < 5 million , azoospermia). We compared the number of oligospermic men before versus after the legislation. Men who did not receive ART were characterized according to eligibility criteria of military service connection to the infertility<symptom> diagnosis. Six hundred twenty-seven men underwent SA or were diagnosed with infertility<symptom>. Among 474 men with SA , 206 ( 43.5 %) were diagnosed with infertility<symptom> and 268 ( 56.5 %) were not. Additionally , 153 men received an infertility<symptom> diagnosis without SA. More men had oligospermia and severe oligospermia after the legislation ( 1 A substantial proportion of veterans with abnormal sperm concentrations were not diagnosed with infertility<symptom> , while others carrying an infertility<symptom> diagnosis did not undergo SA. Most patients clinically eligible for ART did not proceed with further evaluation due to lack of military service connection to their infertility<symptom> diagnosis.
