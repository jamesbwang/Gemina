 Antipsychotic drug ( APD) prescription/use in children has increased significantly worldwide , despite limited insight into potential long-term effects of treatment on adult brain functioning. While initial long-term studies have uncovered alterations to behaviors following early APD treatment , further investigations into potential changes to receptor density levels of related neurotransmitter ( NT) systems are required. The current investigation utilized an animal model for early APD treatment with aripiprazole , olanzapine , and risperidone in male and female juvenile rats to investigate potential long-term changes to the adult serotonin ( 5-HT) NT system. Levels of 5-HT In the male cohort , long-term changes to 5-HT The results of this study suggest that early treatment of various APDs in juvenile rats may cause gender and brain regional specific changes in 5-HT
