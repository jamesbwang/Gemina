 Surgical treatment of femoral neck fracture in young adults is clinically challenging due to the high incidence of avascular necrosis<symptom> of femoral head and fracture nonunion. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of cannulated screws with deep circumflex iliac artery bone grafting ( DCIABG) by comparing to the routinely used method in the treatment of femoral neck fracture in young adults. From March 2006 to December 2012 , a total of 185 patients with femoral neck fracture were admitted to the hospital for internal fixation surgery , 103 patients ( 61 males and 42 females , mean age of 39.1 years) were treated with three cannulated screws with DCIABG ( group A) , and 82 patients ( 49 males and 33 females , mean age of 35.5 years) were treated with three cannulated screws without DCIABG ( group B). All patients were followed up for at least 24 months after the surgery. The patients in group A had a significantly higher Harris Hip Score ( p < 0.001) , shorter fracture healing time ( p < 0.001) , lower occurrence rate of avascular necrosis<symptom> of femoral head ( p = 0.008) and fracture nonunion ( p = 0.012) compared to the patients in group B. However , the operation time and intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> were significantly lower in patients in group B than those in group A ( p < 0.001). Cannulated screws with DCIABG significantly reduced femoral head osteonecrosis and fracture nonunion. Therefore , it is a feasible and effective method in the treatment of young adult patients with femoral neck fracture.
