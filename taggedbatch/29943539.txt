 In order to find the insect-resistant composition and differentially expressed proteins of mungbean , Jinlv No. 7 , B20 and Weilv 2117 were used as experimental materials , and the differential proteins and functions of mungbean varieties that are resistant and susceptible to bruchids were compared and analyzed by two dimensional gel electrophoresis ( 2-DE) and identified by mass spectrometry. Among the samples , 15 protein spots showed a more than 2.5 times reproducible up-regulated , significance 6 of them were successfully identified by the database , and involved three kinds of proteins. They are the alpha and beta subtype 8S globulin , ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase ( RuBis CO) subunits binding protein and the precursor peptide chains for amylase inhibitor and trypsin inhibitor. The protein expressions of B49 ( alpha subtype 8S globulin) and B31 ( RuBis CO subunits binding protein) of insect-resistant mungbean were 10 000 and 23 times higher than that of insect-susceptible mungbeans. It stunted the growth and even death of the Callosobruchus chinensis L. that alpha and beta subtype 8S globulin and RuBis CO subunits binding protein and precursor peptide chains for amylase inhibitor and trypsin inhibitor of insect-resistant mungbean , the bruchid resistance effect of these three proteins need to further verified in terms of the quantity and the combined effect.
