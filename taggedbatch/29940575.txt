 Platinum-based chemotherapy is one of the most important strategies for treatment of colorectal cancer. To improve the therapeutic efficiency , adjuvant drugs were sought to sensitize colorectal cancer cells to platinum-based agents such as cisplatin. As previous research has shown that miRNAs are associated with chemosensitivity , we aimed to alter miRNA regulation in colorectal cancer cells to increase their chemosensitivity. MTT assays were performed to determine the viability of HT29 , SW480 , and LoVo cells. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) was performed to examine the expression of miR-20a in these cell lines. Regulation of the miR-20a/ ASK1 axis was confirmed by western blotting and luciferase reporter assays. After treatment with miR-20a inhibitor ( anti-miR-20a) and cisplatin , production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , mitochondrial membrane potential , and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry. Activation of ASK1 , Bcl-xl , JNK , and caspase-9 , -7 , and -3 was detected by western blotting. miR-20a was overexpressed in colorectal cancer cell lines. Furthermore , knockdown of miR-20a increased the sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to cisplatin treatment in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that the ASK1 gene was the target of miR-20a , and knockdown of miR-20a increased the expression of ASK1 in colorectal cancer cells. As cisplatin treatment induced production of ROS , knockdown of miR-20a enhanced ROS signaling through promoting the phosphorylation of ASK1. Phosphorylation of JNK and the subsequent mitochondrial apoptosis were triggered by the combination of cisplatin and anti-miR-20a. Knockdown of miR-20a enhanced sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to cisplatin through the ROS/ASK1/JNK pathway.
