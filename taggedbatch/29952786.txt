 To appropriately identify and treat noncommunicable diseases ( NCDs) among persons living with HIV<pathogen> ( PLHIV) in low-and-middle-income countries ( LMICs) , it is imperative to understand the burden of NCDs among PLHIV in LMICs and the current management of the diseases. Systematic review and meta-analysis. We examined peer-reviewed literature published between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2016 to assess currently available evidence regarding HIV<pathogen> and four selected NCDs ( cardiovascular disease , cervical cancer , depression<symptom> , and diabetes) in LMICs with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa. The databases , PubMed/MEDLINE , Cochrane Review , and Scopus , were searched to identify relevant literature. For conditions with adequate data available , pooled estimates for prevalence were generated using random fixed effects models. Six thousand one hundred and forty-three abstracts were reviewed , 377 had potentially relevant prevalence data and 141 were included in the summary; 57 were selected for quantitative analysis. Pooled estimates for NCD prevalence were hypertension 21.2 % ( 95 % CI 16.3-27.1) , hypercholesterolemia 22.2 % ( 95 % CI 14.7-32.1) , elevated low-density lipoprotein 23.2 % ( 95 % CI 15.2-33.6) , hypertriglyceridemia 27.2 % ( 95 % CI 20.7-34.8) , low high-density lipoprotein 52.3 % ( 95 % CI 35.6-62.8) , obesity 7.8 % ( 95 % CI 4.3-13.9) , and depression<symptom> 24.4 % ( 95 % CI 12.5-42.1). Invasive cervical cancer and diabetes prevalence were 1.3-1.7 and 1.3-18 % , respectively. Few NCD-HIV integrated programs with screening and management approaches that are contextually appropriate for resource-limited settings exist. Improved data collection and surveillance of NCDs among PLHIV in LMICs are necessary to inform integrated HIV/NCD care models. Although efforts to integrate care exist , further research is needed to optimize the efficacy of these programs.
