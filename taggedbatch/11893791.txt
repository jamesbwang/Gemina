 The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among obesity , family socioeconomic status , oral health behaviors , and dental<disease> caries<disease> and to identify possible differences in factors related with dental<disease> caries<disease> according to gender among a representative sample of Korean adolescents. Data were obtained from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , which was conducted between 2010 and 2012. This nationally representative cross-sectional survey included approximately 10,000 individuals , including adolescents , each year as a survey sample , and collected information on socioeconomic status , health-related behaviors , quality of life , healthcare utilization , anthropometric measures , biochemical and clinical profiles for non-communicable diseases , and dietary intake via three component surveys ( health interview , health examination , and nutrition survey). The health interview and health examination were conducted by trained staff members. A total of 1646 adolescents of ages 13 to 18 years old were included in this study; there were 879 males and 767 females. Data were analyzed by t-test , X In males , significant associations between family income and dental<disease> caries<disease> on permanent teeth were noted after adjusting for confounding variables; the odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals thereof were 0.43 ( 0.24-0.76) , 0.41 ( 0.24-0.70) , and 0.28 ( 0.16-0.49) for low-middle , middle-high , and high family income , respectively. Smoking experience showed a significant association with dental<disease> caries<disease> on permanent teeth in females. Oral health behaviors , such as tooth brushing frequency , were associated with dental<disease> caries<disease> in only male adolescents. There was no association between obesity and dental<disease> caries<disease> on permanent teeth in either male or female adolescents. The present study demonstrated that factors associated with dental<disease> caries<disease> in adolescents differ according to gender. Therefore , gender-specific interventions may be warranted to improve dental health among adolescents.
