 Using alternative agricultural practices in combination with proper postharvest handling has become a major goal to improve fresh produce quality. Here , two different strawberry ( Fragaria Ã— ananassa) genotypes were used as a model to study the impact of repeated , reduced-fungicide or no-fungicide applications on the sensory quality , physicochemical attributes , polyphenol profiles , and residual fungicide in strawberries. Strawberries grown under reduced-fungicide applications had similar or better physicochemical quality than conventionally and organically grown fruit and lower levels of fungicide residues than conventional fruit. Overall , flavor- and health-related attributes of strawberries from reduced-fungicide applications were intermediate between conventional and organic fruit. Thus , growing strawberries with reduced-fungicide applications can be an alternative to conventional or organic agricultural practices.
