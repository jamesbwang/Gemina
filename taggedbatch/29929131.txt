 Water contamination by nickel ( Ni) has become an increasing concern in recent decades. Hydrilla verticillata ( L.f.) Royle has been recognized as a promising accumulator of several potentially toxic elements ( PTEs) in phytoremediation , but its Ni-accumulation characteristics and its mechanisms of tolerance to Ni remain largely unknown. This research investigated the biochemical responses of leaves and stems of H. verticillata to various concentrations of Ni ( 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , and 40 Î¼M) over periods of 7 , 14 , or 21 days. Plants accumulated considerable Ni to a maximum amount of 1080 mg kg
