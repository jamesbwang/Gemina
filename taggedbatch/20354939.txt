 Tissue diagnosis is required for gastric subepithelial lesions<symptom> for differential diagnosis of GISTs. However , there has not been consensus about the best needle for EUS-guided sampling of these lesions<symptom>. To evaluate the diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA for gastric subepithelial lesions<symptom> of the proper muscle layer with large-bore 19 gauge needles. A prospectively maintained database was retrospectively reviewed to identify consecutive patients who underwent EUS-FNA with 19 and 22 gauge needles for gastric subepithelial lesions<symptom> of the fourth endosonographic layer in a tertiary care referral center. EUS-FNA was performed by the same endosonographer , using the fanning technique , without on-site cytopathologist. Specimens were analysed through cell blocks by the same pathologist. Procedure results were categorized into diagnostic , defined as enough material for histopathology and immunohistochemistry , or nondiagnostic. Eighty-nine patients ( mean age: 59 years , 77 % women) underwent 92 EUS-FNA with 19 ( 75) or 22 ( 17) gauge needles. Mean lesion<symptom> size was 22.6 mm. Overall diagnostic yield was 88 %. The diagnostic yield of 19 gauge was higher than that of 22 gauge needle ( 92 % x70 .6 %; p = 0.0410) , and similar for lesions<symptom> > 2 cm and < 2 cm ( 93.7 % x90 .7 %; p = 0.9563). The best performance for 19 gauge needles was obtained performing < 3 needle passes. Complication rate was 2.8 %. Diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA with 19 gauge needles is 92 % for gastric subepithelial lesions<symptom> of the proper muscle layer. It is safe and highly valuable for differentiation between GIST and leiomyoma , no matter the size of the lesion<symptom>.
