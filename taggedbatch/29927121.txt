 2 '- O ,4 '- C-Ethylene-bridged nucleic acid ( ENA) is a sugar-modified oligonucleotide with an ethylene bridge between the 2 '- oxygen and 4 '- carbon of ribose. ENA not only has as high binding affinity to complementary RNA as conventional bridged/locked nucleic acid , but also has much higher nuclease resistance in plasma , which makes it a promising candidate for antisense therapeutics. This unit presents detailed protocols for the synthesis and characterization of ENA nucleosides and oligonucleotides. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
