 The dynamics of a two-species community of N competing individuals are considered , with an emphasis on the role of environmental variations that affect coherently the fitness of entire populations. The chance of fixation of a mutant ( or invading) population is calculated as a function of its mean relative fitness , the amplitude of fitness variations and their typical duration. We emphasize the distinction between the case of pairwise competition and the case of global competition; in the latter a noise-induced stabilization mechanism yields a higher chance of fixation for a single mutant. This distinction becomes dramatic in the weak selection regime , where the chance of fixation for a single deleterious mutant is an N-independent constant for global competition and decays like ( ln N)
