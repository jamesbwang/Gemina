 The present study intended to investigate efficacy of radiotherapy in the treatment of intermediate and advanced stage lung cancer and the effects on serum vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9). Serum levels of VEGF and MMP-9 of 77 patients with intermediate or advanced lung cancer were detected before and after the treatment. At the same time , 19 healthy people were selected as the control group. Gelatin zymography was applied to measure the activity of serum MMP-9 , ELISA was performed to detect the VEGF and MMP-9 levels in the peripheral blood and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR) was used to measure the messenger RNA ( mRNA) levels of VEGF and MMP-9 in serum. Results indicated that the overall response rate of radiotherapy on intermediate and advanced lung cancer reached 70.1 %. Levels of serum VEGF and MMP-9 in the effective treatment group were significantly lower than those before the treatment ( P < 0.05). Furthermore , expression levels of VEGF and MMP-9 in the effective radiotherapy group were significantly lower than those in ineffective group ( P < 0.05) , MMP-9 activity before treatment was significantly higher than that after treatment ( P < 0.05) and expression levels of VEGF and MMP-9 mRNA before treatment were significantly elevated compared with those after treatment ( P < 0.05). The results suggested that the expression levels of serum VEGF and MMP-9 may be useful indicators for the evaluation of the efficacy of radiotherapy in the treatment of intermediate and advanced lung cancer.
