 Chromosome organization and chromatin mobility are central to DNA metabolism. In particular , it has been recently shown by several labs that double strand breaks ( DSBs) in yeast induce a change in chromatin mobility at the site of the damage. Intriguingly , DSB also induces a global mobility of the genome , at others , potentially undamaged positions. How mobility is regulated and what are the functional outcomes of these global changes in chromatin dynamics are , however , not yet fully understood. We present the current state of knowledge in light of the recent literature and discuss some perspectives opened by these discoveries towards genome stability.
