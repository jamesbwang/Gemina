 Polymeric nanoparticles are widely investigated to enhance the selectivity of therapeutics to targeted sites , as well as to increase circulation lifetime and water solubility of poorly soluble drugs. In contrast to the encapsulation of the cargo into the nanostructures , the conjugation directly to the polymer backbone allows better control on the loading and selective triggered release. In this work we report a simple procedure to create biodegradable polycarbonate graft copolymer nanoparticles via a ring opening polymerization and subsequent postpolymerization modification strategies. The polymer , designed with both pH-responsive acetal linkages and a norbornene group , allows for highly efficient postpolymerization modifications through a range of chemistries to conjugate imaging agents and solubilizing arms to direct self-assembly. To demonstrate the potential of this approach , polycarbonate-based nanoparticles were tested for biocompatibility and their ability to be internalized in A549 and IMR-90 cell lines.
