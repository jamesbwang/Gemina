 There are few longitudinal data on change in bone structure and muscle mass , strength and function in later life. We report these , and consider bone-muscle interrelationships in older men and women. We studied 188 men and 166 women from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study , who underwent peripheral quantitative computed tomography ( pQCT) of the radius and tibia in 2004-2005 and then again in 2011-2012. Grip strength and gait speed were also assessed at both timepoints. Percentage change per year was calculated for grip strength , gait speed , muscle cross-sectional area ( mCSA) , fat cross-sectional area ( fCSA) and diaphyseal bone parameters ( total area ( Tt.Ar) , cortical area ( Ct.Ar) , cortical density ( cBMD) and trabecular density ( tBMD)). The mean ( SD) age of men and women at baseline was 68.9 ( 2.5) and 69.2 ( 2.6) years , respectively. Rates of muscle area and strength loss did not differ by sex. Tt.Ar increased with age and faster in men ( mean ( SD) 1.78 ( 1.64) %/ year) than women ( mean ( SD) 1.03 ( 1.69) %/ year) in the radius ( p < 0.001). In both the radius ( p = 0.006) and tibia ( p < 0.001) , Ct.Ar reduced more rapidly in women than men. Change in Ct.Ar was associated with change in muscle area in the corresponding limb ( radius; men: regression coefficient 0.36 , 95 % CI 0.20-0.52 , p < 0.001; tibia; men: regression coefficient 0.14 , 95 % CI 0.00-0.27 , p = 0.043 , women: regression coefficient 0.16 , 95 % CI 0.01-0.30 , p = 0.032). We have demonstrated that muscle strength and function decrease faster than muscle mass and have provided further evidence that changes in bone structure with age differ by sex.
