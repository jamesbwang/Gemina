 The healthy immune system has natural checkpoints that temper pernicious inflammation<symptom>. Cells mediating these checkpoints include regulatory T cells , regulatory B cells , regulatory dendritic cells , microglia , macrophages and monocytes. Here , we highlight discoveries on the beneficial functions of regulatory immune cells and their mechanisms of action and evaluate their potential use as novel cell-based therapies for brain disorders. Regulatory immune cell therapies have the potential not only to mitigate the exacerbation of brain injury by inflammation<symptom> but also to promote an active post-injury brain repair programme. By harnessing the reparative properties of these cells , we can reduce over-reliance on medications that mask clinical symptoms but fail to impede or reverse the progression of brain disorders. Although these discoveries encourage further testing and genetic engineering of regulatory immune cells for the clinical management of neurological disorders , a number of challenges must be surmounted to improve their safety and efficacy in humans.
