 Optimization of critical factors affects transduction efficiency and is able to reduce reagent consumption. The present study aimed to determine the optimum transduction conditions of small hairpin ( sh) RNA against peroxiredoxin 4 ( PRDX4) in the HepG2 cell line. Cell viability assays were conducted based on serum condition , incubation time , polybrene concentration and antibiotic dose selection. Non-targeting control shRNA was transduced into HepG2 cells in a 5-fold serial dilution , and colonies positive for green fluorescent protein were counted using ImageJ software. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were performed to validate PRDX4 expression. The optimum cell density for transduction was 5.0 Ã— 10
