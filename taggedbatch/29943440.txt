 In this paper , we consider the problem of nonparametric curve fitting in the specific context of censored data. We propose an extension of the penalized splines approach using Kaplan-Meier weights to take into account the effect of censorship and generalized cross-validation techniques to choose the smoothing parameter adapted to the case of censored samples. Using various simulation studies , we analyze the effectiveness of the censored penalized splines method proposed and show that the performance is quite satisfactory. We have extended this proposal to a generalized additive models ( GAM) framework introducing a correction of the censorship effect , thus enabling more complex models to be estimated immediately. A real dataset from Stanford Heart Transplant data is also used to illustrate the methodology proposed , which is shown to be a good alternative when the probability distribution for the response variable and the functional form are not known in censored regression models.
