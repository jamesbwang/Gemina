 The contents of working memory ( WM) can affect the subsequent visual search performance , resulting in either beneficial or cost effects , when the visual search target is included in or spatially dissociated from the memorized contents , respectively. The right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( rDLPFC) and the right posterior parietal cortex ( rPPC) have been suggested to be associated with the congruence/incongruence effects of the WM content and the visual search target. Thus , in the present study , we investigated the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the PPC in controlling the interaction between WM and attention during a visual search , using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS). Subjects maintained a color in WM while performing a search task. The color cue contained the target ( valid) , the distractor ( invalid) or did not reappear in the search display ( neutral). Concurrent stimulation with the search onset showed that relative to rTMS over the vertex , rTMS over rPPC and rDLPFC further decreased the search reaction time , when the memory cue contained the search target. The results suggest that the rDLPFC and the rPPC are critical for controlling WM biases in human visual attention.
