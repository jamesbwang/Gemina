 Glycoside Hydrolase 3 ( GH3) is a phytohormone-responsive family of proteins found in many plant species. These proteins contribute to the biological activity of indolacetic acid ( IAA) , jasmonic acid ( JA) , and salicylic acid ( SA). They also affect plant growth and developmental processes as well as some types of stress. In this study ,
