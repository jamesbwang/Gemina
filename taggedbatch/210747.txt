 Fluoroquinolones<disease> increase the risk of peripheral neuropathy. The present work aims to report a case of fluoroquinolone-related severe axonal neuropathy. The subject of this study was a 62-year-old man who exhibited generalized sensory<symptom> disturbances<symptom> 4 days after treatment by ciprofloxacin prescribed for urinary<disease> infection<disease>. Electrodiagnostic studies revealed severe motor-sensory axonal neuropathy with widespread fibrillation potentials in support of generalized motor polyradiculopathy. There was no evidence of conduction blocks or albuminocytologic dissociation in favor of an autoimmune inflammatory reaction. The only pathological biomarker was the reduction of serum folate. According to this case , we suggest that folate level could be routinely measured and supplementation should be performed in patients with fluoroquinolone-induced neuropathy.
