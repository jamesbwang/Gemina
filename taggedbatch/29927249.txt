 Proteins that are site-specifically modified with peptides and chemicals can be used as novel therapeutics , imaging tools , diagnostic reagents and materials. However , there are few enzyme-catalyzed methods currently available to selectively conjugate peptides to internal sites within proteins. Here we show that a pilus-specific sortase enzyme from Corynebacterium<pathogen> diphtheriae<pathogen><disease> (
