 Endoscopy is becoming one of the widely-used technologies to screen the gastric diseases , and it heavily relies on the experiences of the clinical endoscopists. The location , shape , and size are the typical patterns for the endoscopists to make the diagnosis decisions. The contrasting texture patterns also suggest the potential lesions<symptom>. This study designed a novel rotation-tolerant image feature , TriZ , and demonstrated the effectiveness on both the rotation invariance and the lesion<symptom> detection of three gastric lesion<symptom> types , i.e. , gastric polyp , gastric ulcer<disease><symptom> , and gastritis<disease>. TriZ achieved 87.0 % in the four-class classification problem of the three gastric lesion<symptom> types and the healthy controls , averaged over the twenty random runs of 10-fold cross-validations. Due to that biomedical imaging technologies may capture the lesion<symptom> sites from different angles , the symmetric image feature extraction algorithm TriZ may facilitate the biomedical image based disease diagnosis modeling. Compared with the 378,434 features of the HOG algorithm , TriZ achieved a better accuracy using only 126 image features.
