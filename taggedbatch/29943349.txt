 The determination of natural products stereochemistry remains a formidable task. Residual dipolar couplings ( RDCs) induced by anisotropic media are a powerful tool for determination of the stereochemistry of organic molecule in solution. This review will provide a short introduction on RDCs-based methodology for the structural elucidation of natural products. Special attention is given to the current availability of alignment media in organic solvents. The applications of RDCs for structural analysis of some examples of natural products were discussed and summarized.
