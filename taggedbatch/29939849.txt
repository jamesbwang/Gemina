 Functional mitral regurgitation ( FMR) is common in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and portends a poor prognosis. The etiology is secondary to non-ischemic or ischemic ( post myocardial infarction) adverse remodeling. Treatment includes guideline-directed medical therapy , cardiac resynchronization therapy , and in some cases , surgical repair or replacement. Transcatheter mitral valve repair with the MitraClip device is approved in patients with degenerative MR and is currently under investigation for use in FMR; as are several transcatheter mitral valve repair devices. This review discusses the basis of FMR pathophysiology , classification and prognosis , provides an overview of current therapeutic approaches , examines the available literature on the use of MitraClip in patients with FMR , and provides insight into ongoing clinical trials and new investigational devices for the treatment of FMR.
