 Insulin-like growth factors ( IGFs) play a critical role in fetal growth , and components of the IGF system have been associated with fetal growth restriction in women. In human pregnancy , the proteolytic cleavage of insulin-like growth factor binding proteins ( IGFBPs) , particularly IGFBP-4 , releases free IGF for respective action at the tissue level. The aim of the present study was to determine IGFBP-2 , IGFBP-3 , and IGFBP-4 concentrations by Western ligand blotting during pregnancy until day 100 in cows and to compare these concentrations with those of non-pregnant cows and cows undergoing embryonic/fetal mortality. Therefore , two study trials ( I and II) and an
