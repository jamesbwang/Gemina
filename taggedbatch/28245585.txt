 The inverse problem in electrophysiology consists of the accurate estimation of the intracardiac electrical sources from a reduced set of electrodes at short distances and from outside the heart. This estimation can provide an image with relevant knowledge on arrhythmia mechanisms for the clinical practice. Methods based on truncated singular value decomposition ( TSVD) and regularized least squares require a matrix inversion , which limits their resolution due to the unavoidable low-pass filter effect of the Tikhonov regularization techniques. We propose to use , for the first time , a Mercer 's kernel given by the Laplacian of the distance in the quasielectrostatic field equations , hence providing a Support Vector Regression ( SVR) formulation by following the principles of the Dual Signal Model ( DSM) principles for creating kernel algorithms. Simulations in one- and two-dimensional models show the performance of our Laplacian distance kernel technique versus several conventional methods. Firstly , the one-dimensional model is adjusted for yielding recorded electrograms , similar to the ones that are usually observed in electrophysiological studies , and suitable strategy is designed for the free-parameter search. Secondly , simulations both in one- and two-dimensional models show larger noise sensitivity in the estimated transfer matrix than in the observation measurements , and DSM-SVR is shown to be more robust to noisy transfer matrix than TSVD. These results suggest that our proposed DSM-SVR with Laplacian distance kernel can be an efficient alternative to improve the resolution in current and emerging intracardiac imaging systems.
