 In this paper , we introduce a new compact left-handed tunable metamaterial structure , inspired by a joint T-D shape geometry on a flexible NiAl2O4 substrate. The designed metamaterial exhibits an extra-large negative refractive index bandwidth of 6.34 GHz , with an operating frequency range from 4 to 18 GHz. We demonstrate the effects of substrate material thickness on the effective properties of metamaterial using two substrate materials: 1) flame retardant 4 and 2) flexible nickel aluminate. A finite integration technique based on the Computer Simulation Technology Microwave Studio electromagnetic simulator was used for our design , simulation , and investigation. A finite element method based on an HFSS ( High Frequency Structure Simulator) electromagnetic simulator is also used to simulate results , perform verifications , and compare the measured results. The simulated resonance peaks occurred at 6.42 GHz ( C-band) , 9.32 GHz ( X-band) , and 16.90 GHz ( Ku-band) , while the measured resonance peaks occurred at 6.60 GHz ( C-band) , 9.16 GHz ( X-band) and 17.28 GHz ( Ku-band). The metamaterial structure exhibited biaxial tunable properties by changing the electromagnetic wave propagation in the y and z directions and the left-handed characteristics at 11.35 GHz and 13.50 GHz.
