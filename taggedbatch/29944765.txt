 The genes encoding adaptive immune antigen receptors , namely the immunoglobulins expressed in membrane-bound or secreted forms by B cells , and the cell surface T cell receptors , are unique in human biology because they are generated by combinatorial rearrangement of the genomic DNA. The diversity of receptors so generated in populations of lymphocytes enables the human immune system to recognize antigens expressed by pathogens , but also underlies the pathological specificity of autoimmune diseases and the mistargeted immunity in allergies. Several recent technological developments , foremost among them the invention of high-throughput DNA sequencing instruments , have enabled much deeper and thorough evaluation of clones of human<pathogen> B<pathogen> cells and T cells and the antigen receptors they express during physiological and pathogenic immune responses. The evolutionary struggles between host adaptive immune responses and populations of pathogens are now open to greater scrutiny , elucidation of the underlying reasons for successful or failed immunity , and potential predictive modeling , than ever before. Here we give an overview of the foundations , recent progress , and future prospects in this dynamic area of research.
