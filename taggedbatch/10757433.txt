 To investigate whether exposure to metformin during the first trimester of pregnancy , for diabetes or other indications , increases the risk of all or specific congenital anomalies. Population based exploratory case-control study using malformed controls. Cases of 29 specific subgroups of non-genetic anomalies , and all non-genetic anomalies combined , were compared with controls ( all other non-genetic anomalies or genetic syndromes<disease><symptom>). 11 EUROmediCAT European congenital anomaly registries surveying 1892482 births in Europe between 2006 and 2013. 50167 babies affected by congenital anomaly ( 41242 non-genetic and 8925 genetic) including live births , fetal deaths from 20 weeks ' gestation , and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly. Odds ratios adjusted for maternal age , registry , multiple birth , and maternal diabetes status. 168 babies affected by congenital anomaly ( 141 non-genetic and 27 genetic) were exposed to metformin , 3.3 per 1000 births. No evidence was found for a higher proportion of exposure to metformin during the first trimester among babies with all non-genetic anomalies combined compared with genetic controls ( adjusted odds ratio 0.84 , 95 % confidence interval 0.55 to 1.30). The only significant result was for pulmonary valve atresia ( adjusted odds ratio 3.54 , 1.05 to 12.00 , compared with non-genetic controls; 2.86 , 0.79 to 10.30 , compared with genetic controls). No evidence was found for an increased risk of all non-genetic congenital anomalies combined following exposure to metformin during the first trimester , and the one significant association was no more than would be expected by chance. Further surveillance is needed to increase sample size and follow up the cardiac signal , but these findings are reassuring given the increasing use of metformin in pregnancy.
