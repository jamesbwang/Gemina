 Honey bee colonies suffer from various pathogens , including honey bee viruses. About 24 viruses have been reported so far. However , six of them are considered to cause severe infection which inflicts heavy losses on beekeeping. The aim of this study was to investigate incidence of six honey bee viruses: deformed wing virus ( DWV) , acute bee paralysis virus ( ABPV) , chronic bee paralysis virus ( CBPV) , sacbrood virus ( SBV) , kashmir bee virus ( KBV) , and black queen cell<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( BQCV) by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR). A total of 250 adult honey bee samples were obtained from 50 colonies from eight apiaries situated in three different parts of the country ( South , North and West Bulgaria). The results showed the highest prevalence of DWV followed by SBV and ABPV , and one case of BQCV. A comparison with homology sequences available in GenBank was performed by phylogenetic analysis , and phylogenetic relationships were discussed in the context of newly described genotypes in the uninvestigated South Eastern region of Europe. In conclusion , the present study has been the first to provide sequencing data and phylogenetics analyses of some honey bee viruses in Bulgaria.
