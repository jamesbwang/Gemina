 Genetic approaches have proved valuable to the study and conservation of endangered populations , especially for monitoring programs , and there is potential for further developments in this direction by extending analyses to the genomic level. We assembled the genome of the wolverine ( Gulo gulo) , a mustelid that in Scandinavia has recently recovered from a significant population decline , and obtained a 2.42 Gb draft sequence representing > 85 % of the genome and including > 21,000 protein-coding genes. We then performed whole-genome re-sequencing of 10 Scandinavian wolverines and found that genetic diversity was among the lowest detected in a red-listed population ( mean genome-wide nucleotide diversity of 0.05 %). Demographic analyses indicate a long-term decline of the effective population size ( Ne) , from 10,000 well before the last glaciation to < 500 after this period. Current Ne appeared even lower. We found a genome-wide F
