 To investigate the pain relief effect and safety of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation ( RFA) with a multitined electrode combined with cement injection in patients with painful metastatic bone tumors. Sixteen patients with 34 osteolytic metastatic lesions<symptom> were treated with RFA including 4 males and 12 females ( age range 54-84). Thirteen patients with spinal metastases received additional cement injection. Medical imaging , a visual analog scale ( VAS) and the EORTC QLQ-C30 were performed to evaluate the metastatic lesion<symptom> , pain and quality of life , respectively , before and after RFA and at follow-ups. The RFA and/or vertebroplasty with cement injection were successful in all patients ( 100 %). Except for one patient who had cement leakage , no intraprocedural complications occurred. After RFA , severe refractory pain was greatly relieved in all patients , with pretreatment VAS score of 8.1 ± 1.4 significantly reduced to 5.5 ± 1.1 at 24 h , 2.8 ± 0.6 at 1 week and 1.4 ± 0.8 at 6 months ( P < 0.01). The EORTC QLQ-C30 scale at 1 month demonstrated significant improvement ( P < 0.05) in the physical ( P = 0.03) and emotion function ( P = 0.003) , global health status ( P = 0.002) , pain ( P = 0.001) and insomnia ( P = 0.002). The analgesics were reduced after the procedure and stopped 2 months later in all patients , with greatly improved quality of life and no apparent pain. Followed up for 6-12 months , all patients remained alive with no recurrence of pain. Palliative pain relief and safety of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation combined with cement injection for bone metastasis. RFA with or without bone cement is safe and effective in the palliative treatment of pain caused by metastatic bone tumors.
