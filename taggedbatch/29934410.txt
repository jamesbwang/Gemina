 This study was conducted to identify barriers and facilitators to cervical cancer screening , diagnosis , follow-up care , and treatment among human<pathogen><disease> immunodeficiency<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>)- infected women and clinicians and to explore the acceptability of patient navigators in Tanzania. In 2012 , we conducted four focus groups , two with HIV-positive women and two with clinicians who perform cervical cancer screening , diagnosis , follow-up care , and treatment. Transcriptions were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings from the patient focus groups indicate the prevalence of fear and stigma surrounding cervical cancer as well as a lack of information and access to screening and treatment. The clinician focus groups identified numerous barriers to screening , diagnosis , follow-up care , and treatment. Participants in both types of groups agreed that a patient navigation program would be an effective way to help women navigate across the cancer continuum of care including screening , diagnosis , follow-up care , and treatment. Given the fear , stigma , misinformation , and lack of resources surrounding cervical cancer , it is not surprising that patient navigation would be welcomed by patients and providers.
