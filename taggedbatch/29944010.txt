 Background Inverse associations of the Mediterranean diet ( MedDiet) and physical activity with cardiovascular disease have been previously reported. We investigated the individual and combined contributions of both to this inverse association in a Mediterranean cohort. Design We used data from 19,536 participants from a prospective cohort of Spanish university graduates , the ` Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra ' ( SUN) cohort , followed up between December 1999 and December 2016. Methods Adherence to the MedDiet was obtained from a 136-item validated food-frequency questionnaire and categorized in tertiles using four previously reported dietary scores. A validated questionnaire assessed the physical activity levels according to volume , intensity and frequency. Results Participants were followed up during a median time of 10.4 years. Compared with the lowest category of adherence to the MedDiet ( â‰¤ 3 in the Mediterranean Diet Score) , higher adherence ( 6-9 points) was strongly inversely associated with cardiovascular disease ( multivariable adjusted hazard ratio = 0.33; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.20-0.55). Also , engaging in an active lifestyle ( 6-8 points in an eight-item score) compared with low activity ( < 2 points) was associated with a reduced risk of incident cardiovascular disease ( hazard ratio = 0.43; 95 % CI 0.20-0.90). Greater adherence to the MedDiet and engaging in high levels of active lifestyle showed a 75 % relatively reduced risk of cardiovascular disease ( hazard ratio = 0.25; 95 % CI 0.13-0.48). Conclusions The combined effect of adherence to the MedDiet and adopting an active lifestyle showed a synergistic inverse association with cardiovascular disease risk.
