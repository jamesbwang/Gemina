 A precision feeding ( PF) system was developed to increase broiler breeder lifetime reproductive performance through improved flock uniformity. The current study consisted of 2 rearing and 3 laying treatments. From 0 to 22 wk of age , 480 Cobb male grandparent line pullets and 80 Cobb MX males were fed once daily as a group ( CON) , or individually with a PF system. Pullets were housed in 6 replicate pens of 40 birds , and cockerels in one pen per treatment. During lay , CON and PF treatments continued , and a third treatment was added , where PF-reared birds were transitioned to conventional feeding ( PFCON; n = 3 pens). At photostimulation ( 22 wk of age) , all pens had 24 hens and 2 roosters. Birds were allowed to mate naturally to 52 wk. Analysis of variance was conducted , and Tukey-adjusted means were reported as different where P â‰¤ 0.05. Mean BW was near the target BW in all treatments. At photostimulation , PF pullet BW CV was 2 % vs 14 % in CON pullets. Cumulative feed conversion ratio during rearing was lower in PF treatment pullets , which ate 3 % less than CON pullets. Pullets in the PF treatment received 10 meals spread throughout each day , compared with one meal per day in the CON treatment. Increased feeding frequency would reduce diurnal fluctuations in nutrient supply , which may explain why PF pullets had 1.2 times the breast muscle<symptom> weight of CON pullets at 22 wk. There was no treatment difference in abdominal fatpad weight at 22 wk. The PF treatment had 3.8 % higher fertility and 1.3 % lower egg weight CV compared with the CON treatment. Egg production in PF and PFCON treatments was 0.73 and 0.89 times that of the CON treatment , respectively. It is hypothesized that metabolic changes in PF pullets provided an insufficient metabolic trigger for sexual maturation. It follows that relaxing feed restriction may increase fat deposition and egg production in PF broiler breeders.
