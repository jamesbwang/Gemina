 It has been documented that over-expression of metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 ( MACC1) is related to poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). This study investigates the function and underlying molecular mechanisms of MACC1 in lung adenocarcinoma. Here , we firstly employed immunohistochemistry , western blotting , real-time PCR , and online database to demonstrate that MACC1 expression was elevated in tumor tissues compared with tumor-adjacent or normal tissues. Real-time PCR , CCK-8 , colony formation western blotting , Hoechst staining , and flow cytometry assays then evaluated the effects of MACC1 knockdown on the cell cycle , cell proliferation and apoptosis in A549 and H1299 adenocarcinoma cells. Result highlighted that MACC1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation , induced G0/G1 phase arrest and promoted cell apoptosis in vitro. Mechanistic analysis revealed it also up-regulated expression levels of bax , cleaved-caspase-3 and cleaved-PARP while down-regulating cyclin D1 , c-myc , bcl-2 , and ß-catenin expression in A549 cells. Intriguingly , up-regulation of ß-catenin suppressed G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in MACC1-silenced A549 cells and this was accompanied by increased levels of cyclin D1 , c-myc , and bcl-2. Collectively , our results indicate that MACC1 knockdown effectively inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis of lung adenocarcinoma cells by regulating the ß-catenin pathway.
