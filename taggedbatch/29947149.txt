 6-Thioguanine ( 6TG) is a DNA-targeting therapeutic used in the treatment of various cancers. While 6TG was rationally designed as a proof of concept for antimetabolite therapy , it is also a rare thioamide-bearing bacterial natural product and critical virulence factor of Erwinia<pathogen> amylovorans , plant pathogens causing fire blight. Through gene expression , biochemical assays and mutational analyses we identified a specialized bipartite enzyme system , consisting of an ATP-dependent sulfur transferase ( YcfA) and a sulfur-mobilizing enzyme ( YcfC) , responsible for the peculiar oxygen-by-sulfur substitution. Mechanistic and phylogenetic studies revealed that YcfA-mediated 6TG biosynthesis evolved from ancient tRNA modifications that support translational fidelity. The successful in vitro reconstitution of 6TG thioamidation showed that YcfA employs a specialized sulfur shuttle that markedly differs from universal RNA-related systems. This study sheds light on underexplored enzymatic C-S bond formations in natural product biosynthesis.
