 While a growing number of works have been published about the use of mixed methods research in nursing , scarce attention has been devoted to the issue of the quality of mixed methods within the discipline. The quality appraisal of mixed methods research poses two problems to nursing science: first , current quality criteria are not nursing-specific and consequently , they might not facilitate the application of mixed methods research findings into nursing practice. Second , criteria were theoretically derived and as such , they might not faithfully account for the decisions that nurse researchers take when appraising mixed methods research studies. This qualitative , within-case study explored the views of nurse researchers about mixed methods research in general and , more specifically , the question of quality in mixed methods research. An international sample of 13 nurse researchers was interviewed via Skype and phone. Thematic analysis revealed that the participants favored universal , cross-disciplinary quality criteria , and not criteria specific to the nursing discipline , and a consensual and standardized approach to appraising the quality of mixed methods research. Recommendations are put forward to strengthen the quality appraisal of mixed methods research studies by nurse researchers , as well as future works on this topic within nursing science.
