 The prevalence of chronic kidney disease ( CKD) is increasing worldwide , with costs that can be impeditive. To establish the expenses of the Brazilian Public Healthcare System ( SUS) , with hospitalizations due to CKD and related diseases; evaluating expenses with renal replacement therapy ( RRT). We have assessed the values paid by the SUS in the triennium 2013-2015 , for estimating annual expenses with CKD treatment and hospitalization , associated diseases , and exams. There was an increase in hospitalization by all causes in Brazil during this triennium. CKD and associated diseases corresponded to 1.82 % and 5.79 % of hospitalizations due to all causes in Brazil , and 2.87 % and 10.10 % of all expenses , respectively. Kidney grafts from deceased donors corresponded to 76 % of hospitalizations and 80 % of expenses with transplantation. There was a decrease in transplantation from living donors. There was an increase in the number of exams of 11.94 % and of 10.95 % in the expenses. There was a decrease in the number of procedures and expenses in intermittent peritoneal dialysis ( IPD) and related procedures; but other procedures increased. Hemodialysis ( 3 weekly sessions) corresponded to 95.96 % of procedures and 96.07 % of expenses with dialysis in general. Renal diseases and some of the main related diseases corresponded to 12.97 % of the expenses in the triennium 2013-2015 , and RRT to more than 5 % of the SUS expenses with medium and high complexity healthcare. Such high expenses determine great concerns on the future maintenance of treatment for stage-5 CKD in Brazil and countries in similar or worse conditions of development.
