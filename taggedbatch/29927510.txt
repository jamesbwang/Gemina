 To investigate school performance of childhood cancer survivors focusing on the child 's functioning , including peer relationships , school attendance , and academic achievement. We studied 241 children from 15 institutions in Korea between 2015 and 2016. The self-reported paper-and-pencil questionnaires were used. Approximately 22 % of the survivors suffered from lack of friends. Bullying was reported by 30 % of survivors. Survivors who returned to primary school reported a higher incidence of bullying compared with survivors who returned to middle or high school ( P = 0.03). The percentage of children who missed classes more than 4 days in a month was higher in survivors with brain tumors than those with other tumors ( P = 0.04). Approximately 41 % of children reported learning difficulty. After returning to school , 53 % of the patients reported that they had lower overall mark averages than they had before. Patients who returned to high school showed the highest rate of repeating a grade and the lowest rate of achieving high academic marks. The school marks in the Korean ( P = 0.03) , English ( P = 0.04) , and physical education ( P = 0.04) were worse for the children with brain tumors than for the children with other tumors. We found that 20 % to 25 % of survivors experienced peer-related difficulties upon returning to school. Patients who return to school , especially high school , should be provided more educational support to overcome low academic achievement. Particular concern is needed to the patients with brain tumors , who are at risk for significant academic and social difficulties and therefore may require more intensive support in school.
