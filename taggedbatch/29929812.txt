 We describe an unusual case of hyperacute hepatic failure following general anesthesia in a patient receiving a simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplant. Despite an aggressive evaluation of structural , immunological , viral , and toxicological causes , a definitive cause could not be elucidated. The patient required a liver transplant and suffered a protracted hospital course. We discuss the potential causes of fulminant hepatic failure and the perioperative anesthesia management of her subsequent liver transplantation.
