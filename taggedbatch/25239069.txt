 Due to high pollution associated with traditional Portland cement and bio-carbonate cement , a new generation of cementitious material needs to be developed. Bio-barium phosphate , magnesium phosphate , and ferric phosphate are synthesized by bio-mineralization. Firstly , the substrate is hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase secreted via phosphate-mineralization microbes , obtaining phosphate ions. Micro- and nano-scale phosphate minerals are prepared by phosphate ions reacting with different types of metal cation. The setting time of bio-BaHPO
