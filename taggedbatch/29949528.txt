 Over the last decade , significant advances have been made in the development of therapies for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Abiraterone and enzalutamide were approved as treatments based on data supporting improved overall survival compared to placebo. Radium-223 became the first approved radiopharmaceutical which decreased skeletal-related events , palliated pain , and showed improved overall survival in symptomatic patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastasis only. We present the case of an eighty-two year old man with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who was treated with sequential therapy ( abiraterone- enzalutamide- radium 223). The sequencing and treatment used for our patient was viable because of his clinical characteristics , which have allowed for longer survival time with an acceptable quality of life. These actions must be agreed on by the Multidisciplinary Tumour Board , in order to optimize the use of available courses of treatment. The treatment of these patients is changing rapidly , but many questions remain regarding the optimal sequencing of the available drugs. Sequential or concomitant use of the next generation hormonal agents- abiraterone and enzalutamide- can not currently be recommended. Data regarding the safety of concomitant abiraterone , enzalutamide or denosumab with radium-223 is reassuring and timely. However , we can not advocate the general use of combined radium-223 therapy at this time , irrespective of prior therapy. A better understanding of active mechanisms , the genetic characteristics of each metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and the development of new prognostic and predictive biomarkers will help determine sequencing or different combination treatments for each individual patient.
