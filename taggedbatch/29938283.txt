 Light-driven sodium ion pump rhodopsin ( NaR) is a new functional class of microbial rhodopsin. A previous flash photolysis study of Krokinobacter eikastus rhodopsin 2 ( KR2) revealed the presence of three kinetically distinct intermediates: K , L/M , and O. Previous low-temperature Fourier-transform infrared ( FTIR) spectroscopy of KR2 showed that photoisomerization from the all-trans to the 13-cis form is the primary event of the Na + pumping photocycle , but structural information on the subsequent intermediates is limited. Here , we applied step-scan time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy to KR2 and Nonlabens dokdonensis rhodopsin 2 ( NdR2). Both low-temperature static and time-resolved FTIR spectra resolved a K-like intermediate , and the corresponding spectra showed few differences. Strong hydrogen-out-of-plane ( HOOP) vibrations , which appeared in the K intermediate , are common among other rhodopsins. It is , however , unique for NaR that such HOOP bands are persistent in late intermediates , such as L and O intermediates. This observation strongly suggests similar chromophore structures for the K , L , and O intermediates. In fact , an isotope-labeled study that used 12,14-D2 retinal revealed that the chromophore configuration of the O intermediate in NaR is 13-cis. In contrast to the vibrations of the chromophore , those of the protein differ among intermediates , and this is related to the sodium-pumping function. The molecular mechanism of the light-driven sodium pump is discussed on the basis of the present time-resolved FTIR results.
