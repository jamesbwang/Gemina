 Climate change is warming the oceans , increasing carbon dioxide partial pressure and reducing nutrient recycling from deep layers. This will affect carbon ( C) and phosphorus ( P) availability in the oceans , thus , altering the balance<symptom> between the nutrient content of consumers and their food resource. The combined effects of food quality and temperature have been investigated for adult copepods; however , nauplii , the early developmental stages of copepods , often far outnumber adults , grow more rapidly and have a higher phosphorus body content and demand than later life stages. Consequently , ontogeny may affect how copepods respond to the combined stressors of increasing temperature and altered food stoichiometry. We conducted temperature-controlled experiments ( 24 , 28 and 32 Â°C) where Parvocalanus crassirostris was fed either a P-replete or a P-limited phytoplankton food source. Reduced survival of nauplii and copepodites at the highest temperature was ameliorated when fed P-replete food. At higher temperatures , copepodite growth remained stable , but internal C :P stoichiometry diverged in the direction of phytoplankton C :P , suggesting that increased temperature affected copepodite stoichiometric homeostasis. In contrast , naupliar P content increased with temperature and naupliar growth was P limited , suggesting nauplii required additional phosphorus at higher temperatures. We conclude that resource stoichiometry plays a key role in how copepod survival and growth are impacted by temperature , and that ontogeny mediates these responses. Our results suggest that as the extent of warming oceans and phytoplankton nutrient limitation increase , copepod survival and the growth of early life stages may decline.
