 T cells produce a wide variety of effector molecules in response to infections , such as cytokines , chemokines , granzymes , and perforins. Because different stimuli promote the production of specific effector molecules , T cell responses come in different flavors. In addition , single-cell analysis of protein production revealed that T cells respond heterogeneously to activation. To unravel the regulatory mechanisms that determine T cell effector function , novel methods were developed that simultaneously measure protein levels with the corresponding mRNA. These flow cytometry-based fluorescence in situ hybridization ( Flow-FISH) technologies allow for multiparameter analysis with single-cell resolution of both nucleic acids and proteins. Here , we review the currently available methods of Flow-FISH and describe the possible applications thereof , with a specific focus on T cells.
