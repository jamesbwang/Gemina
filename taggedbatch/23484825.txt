 To educate clinicians on cardiovascular considerations and management strategies surrounding pregnancy in childhood cancer survivors. With advances in oncologic treatment , growing numbers of childhood cancer survivors are now able to consider pregnancy. A significant proportion of survivors have received cardiotoxic therapy , particularly anthracyclines , and/or chest radiation. Cardiomyopathy is the most common cardiac complication of cancer-directed therapy; pericardial disease , valvular disease , premature coronary artery disease , and conduction abnormalities are other potential sequelae. In female survivors of childhood malignancy , cardiac evaluation should be performed prior to pregnancy as subclinical disease has the potential to be unmasked by the hemodynamic stress of pregnancy. However , limited data exist on pregnancy outcomes after cancer survivorship. With appropriate management , maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnancy following childhood cancer are generally favorable. Further research is needed to understand the incidence of cardiac complications among childhood cancer survivors , strategies to prevent these complications , optimal cardiovascular management during pregnancy and the postpartum period , and on the impact of pregnancy itself on the natural history of treatment-related cardiotoxicity.
