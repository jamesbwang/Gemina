 Allele frequencies and forensic statistical parameters of 15 autosomal short tandem repeats ( STRs) were evaluated in 200 genetically unrelated individuals of the Baloch population of Pakistan. Total 155 alleles were observed with allele frequencies ranged from 0.003 to 0.425. Among the 15 STRs , D2S1338 was found to be the most polymorphic and discriminating locus while TPOX was the least polymorphic and discriminating locus. The combined power of discrimination ( CPD) , combined power of exclusion ( CPE) , and combined matching probability ( CMP) were found to be 0.9999999999999999978 , 0.999994252 , and 2.14012 Ã— 10
