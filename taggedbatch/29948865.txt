 Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR) estimation equations using creatinine and Cystatin-C appear to be superior to those based on creatinine or Cystatin-C in older adults. We sought to compare the performances of those based on creatinine and Cystatin-C in Chinese older adults with chronic kidney disease ( CKD). A total of 368 Chinese elderly with CKD underwent the dynamic imaging with technetium- Four equations overestimated GFR except for BIS-2 equation in mGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1 .73 m BIS-2 equation may be optimal for Chinese older adults with CKD especially in older adults ≥ 75 years and with mGFR ≥ 30 ml/min/1 .73 m
