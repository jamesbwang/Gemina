 To describe the epidemiology of opioid-use disorder in the rural United States ( U.S.) as it pertains to HIV<pathogen> and hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> transmission and treatment resources. Heroin and fentanyl analogs have surpassed prescription opioids in their availability in rural opioid markets adding to HIV<pathogen> and hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> ( HCV<pathogen>) and overdose risks. Only 18 % of rural individuals live in towns with inpatient services which are of limited quality and utility. Opioid treatment programs that provide methadone are not located in rural areas and only 3 % of the primary care providers have the ability to prescribe buprenorphine. National models and resources have been established but lack implementation in rural areas leading to ongoing HIV<pathogen> and HCV<pathogen> transmission and overdose. Addressing the adverse impact of opioids in the rural U.S. will require a concerted effort to implement effective treatments according to national standards.
