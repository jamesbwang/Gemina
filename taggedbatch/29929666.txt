 This study aimed to evaluate the impact , safety , and success of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) ablation in adults with congenital heart disease ( ACHD) transferring ablation strategies established in normal hearts. AF is an emerging arrhythmia in ACHD. Fifty-seven consecutive ACHD ( median age 51.1 ± 14.8 years) with drug-refractory AF were analyzed who underwent catheter ablation between 2004 and 2017. CHD was classified according to its complexity into mild ( 61.4 %) , moderate ( 17.5 %) , and severe ( 21.1 %) lesions<symptom>. AF ablation was performed in 104 procedures following a sequential ablation approach. Of the 57 patients , 30 underwent corrective surgery , 6 underwent palliative surgery , 5 had catheter interventions , and 16 were natural survivors. Follow-up was available for all patients ( median 41 ± 36 months). The median duration of cyanosis<symptom> was 9.2 ± 19.7 years , and the time of volume or pressure overload prior to corrective surgery or intervention was 26.1 ± 21.2 years and 18.1 ± 15.8 years , respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for arrhythmia-free survival following the index ablation procedure was 63 % for 1 year and 22 % for 5 years. Performing subsequent ablation procedures ( 2.0 ± 0.5) , the Kaplan-Meier estimate significantly improved , with 99 % for 1 year and 83 % for 5 years ( p < 0.01). Five patients died during follow-up due to their underlying CHD condition or underwent transplantation. AF ablation strategies established in normal hearts can be transferred to ACHD. The treatment is safe and effective with acceptable long-term results. Varying anatomical pre-conditions and the heterogeneous population itself are challenging and contribute toward a higher reablation rate. Therefore , AF ablation in ACHD should be reserved for dedicated and highly specialized teams.
