 A customized submaximal exercise test for cycle ergometry was reported as a superior estimate of maximum oxygen uptake ( VO Following similar methodology , we sought to validate a customized submaximal treadmill test ( CustomTM) compared with the widely used Bruce submaximal protocol. Participants ( 29 women and 21 men; age = 31.37 ± 11.44 year , BMI = 24.02 ± 3.03) performed a graded exercise test ( GXT) with a subsequent exhaustive , square-wave bout for the verification of `` true '' VO VO The CustomTM was superior to the Bruce protocol , because it included a stage below and above gas exchange threshold , yielded a better measurement agreement for `` true '' VO
