 Concern over teenage conceptions arises from the adverse health and social sequelae that are associated. These include greater risks of pregnancy complications such as preterm birth and low birthweight and the increased likelihood of social exclusion , poverty and low educational attainment. Another consequence is that daughters of teen mothers are at higher risk themselves of teen pregnancy which perpetrates the cycle of disadvantage. Previous research has reported that children of teenage mothers have one and half to two times increased risk of teenage childbearing compared to children of older mothers ( Kahn et al Demography 1992; 29 ( 1): 39-57).
