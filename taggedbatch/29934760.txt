 The purpose of this study was to determine if a genetic counseling student 's perception of the supervisory working alliance ( SWA) is related to their self-efficacy on select clinical practice-based competencies ( PBCs) , evaluating the second tenet of the Reciprocal Engagement Model of Supervision ( REM-S) from a student perspective. Second year genetic counseling students ( N = 168) completed a survey containing demographic and clinical rotation experience questions , the Supervisory Working Alliance Inventory-Trainee Form ( SWAI-T) , and the Genetic Counseling Self-Efficacy Scale ( GCSES). Overall , the SWAI-T was significantly associated with all factors of the GCSES. Additionally , the relationship between the SWAI-T and self-efficacy was specific to those who had only one supervisor , thus highlighting the SWA may be most important under these circumstances. This serves as an important step in being able to guide supervisors toward effective methods in supervision , which may include encouraging supervisors to build a strong relationship with their supervisee in order to help strengthen the student 's confidence in their clinical skills.
