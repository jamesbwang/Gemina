 The application of detector strategies in scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) correlated with computer tomography ( CT) and light microscopy ( LM) delivered unique new insights in degeneration effects of lithium-ion batteries. There we exemplary studied reference , cycled and storage cells. High-resolution SEM permit to visualize a coating on top of the cathode material of the treated cells for the first time , which also connects the conductive additives and battery active material. This confirms the assumption of a solid permeable interface on top of the cathode. The detection of low-loss reflected backscattered electrons for energies beyond 3 keV increases the available spatial resolution for material contrast. This offered the opportunity to address the atomic number of precipitates in the nm range inside the coating to be above carbon and below Li
