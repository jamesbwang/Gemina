 The paper describes the extension of a previously developed model of pressure-dependent contraction rate to the case of multiple lymphangions. Mechanical factors are key modulators of active lymphatic pumping. As part of the evolution of our lumped-parameter model to match experimental findings , we have designed an algorithm whereby the time until the next contraction depends on lymphangion transmural pressure in the contraction just completed. The functional dependence of frequency on pressure is quantitatively matched to isobaric contraction experiments on isolated lymphatic segments. When each of several lymphangions is given this ability , a scheme for their coordination must be instituted to match the observed synchronization. Accordingly , and in line with an experiment on an isolated lymphatic vessel segment in which we measured contraction sequence and conduction delay , we took the fundamental principle to be that local timing can be overridden by signals to initiate contraction that start in adjacent lymphangions , conducted with a short delay. The scheme leads to retrograde conduction when the lymphangion chain is pumping against an adverse pressure difference , but antegrade conduction when contractions occur with no or a favourable pressure difference. Abolition of these conducted signals leads to chaotic variation of cycle-mean flow-rate from the chain , diastolic duration in each lymphangion , and inter-lymphangion delays. Chaotic rhythm is also seen under other circumstances. Because the model responds to increasing adverse pressure difference by increasing the repetition rate of contractions , it maintains time-average output flow-rate better than one with fixed repetition rate.
