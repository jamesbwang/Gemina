 Intrathecal analgesia is a method using various molecules alone or in combination. Among these , the association sufentanil/ baclofen is widely used. Instead of moving patients to the few expert centers taking charge of these specific preparations , it could be better to transport syringes to peripheral centers managing pump refilling. That is why , it is interesting to demonstrate the stability of the mixture , and so to be able to ensure the best transport conditions of syringes. A stability indicating UPLC-DAD method was developed and validated according to the ICH guidelines. Four mixtures of sufentanil baclofen stored in 5 ± 3 °C and 25 ± 2 °C were evaluated for seven days and compared to the initial observed concentrations. The stability is demonstrated only for preparations stored at 5 ± 3 °C for seven days thanks to relative concentrations ( 95 % confidence intervals of the mean of 3 samples) systematically positioned between 90 % and 110 %. On the other hand , after few days , degradation products of sufentanil appeared for all mixtures stored at 25 °C ± 2 °C. This study shows the stability of a weakly and a highly concentrated mixture of sufentanil and baclofen solutions in polypropylene syringes stored at 5 ± 3 °C for seven days. This result will allow the transport of the preparation under optimal conditions. Advance preparations for intrathecal pump refills could also be feasible.
