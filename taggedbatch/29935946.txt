 In recent years , there have been dramatic changes in our understanding of the role of endogenous 5-Hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT or serotonin) in the control of gastrointestinal ( GI) motility. Whilst it is well accepted that there are numerous types of 5-HT receptors expressed on enteric neurons and that exogenous 5-HT potently stimulates GI-motility , understanding the role of endogenous 5-HT in GI-motility has been substantially more difficult to resolve. Recent studies found 5-HT
