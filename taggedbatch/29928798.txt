 Structure-based `` rational '' drug design strategies fail for diseases associated with intrinsically disordered proteins ( IDPs). However , structural disorder allows large-amplitude spontaneous intramolecular dynamics in a protein. We demonstrate a method that exploits this dynamics to provide quantitative information about the degree of interaction of an IDP with other molecules. A candidate ligand molecule may not bind strongly , but even momentary interactions can be expected to perturb the fluctuations. We measure the amplitude and frequency of the equilibrium fluctuations of fluorescently labeled small oligomers of hIAPP ( an IDP associated with type II diabetes) in a physiological solution , using nanosecond fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy. We show that the interterminal distance fluctuates at a characteristic time scale of 134 ± 10 ns , and 6.4 ± 0.2 % of the population is in the `` closed '' ( quenched) state at equilibrium. These fluctuations are affected in a dose-dependent manner by a series of small molecules known to reduce the toxicity of various amyloid peptides. The degree of interaction increases in the following order: resveratrol < epicatechin ∼ quercetin < Congo red < epigallocatechin 3-gallate. Such ordering can provide a direction for exploring the chemical space for finding stronger-binding ligands. We test the biological relevance of these measurements by measuring the effect of these molecules on the affinity of hIAPP for lipid vesicles and cell membranes<symptom>. We find that the ability of a molecule to modulate intramolecular fluctuations correlates well with its ability to lower membrane affinity. We conclude that structural disorder may provide new avenues for rational drug design for IDPs.
