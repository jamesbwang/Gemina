 Columnar phases formed by the stacking of disclike molecules with an intimate π-π overlap forms a 1D pathway for the anisotropic charge migration along the columns. Columnar phases have great potential in organic electronic devices to be utilized as active semiconducting layers in comparison to organic single crystals or amorphous polymers in terms of processability , ease of handling , and high charge carrier mobility. Intelligent molecular engineering of perylene and its derivatives provided access to tune the physical properties and self-assembly behavior. The columnar phase formed by perylene derivatives has great potential in the fabrication of organic electronic devices. There are several positions on the perylene molecule , which can be functionalized to tune its self-assembly , as well as optoelectronic properties. Thus , many liquid-crystalline molecules stabilizing the columnar phase , which are based on perylene tetraesters , perylene diester imides , and perylene bisimides , have been synthesized over the years. Their longitudinal and laterally extended derivatives , bay-substituted derivatives exhibiting a columnar phase , are reported. In addition , several liquid-crystalline oligomers and polymers based on perylene derivatives were also reported. All such modifications provide an option to tune the energy levels of frontier molecular orbitals with respect to the work function of the electrodes in devices and also the processability of such materials. In this feature article , we attempt to provide an overview of the molecular design developed to tune the applicable properties and self-assembly of perylene derivatives as well as recent developments related to their application in the fabrication of organic solar cells , organic light-emitting diodes , and organic field-effect transistors.
