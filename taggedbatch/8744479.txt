 Previous studies have shown that comprehension of figurative language is impaired in individuals with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD). However , most studies have focused on lexicalized expressions and have only examined performance at one particular point in time , without examining how performance changes over development. The current study examined the comprehension of novel metaphor and metonymy in individuals with ASDs from a large age range , using both a cross-sectional ( Experiment 1) and longitudinal design ( Experiment 2). Performance in the ASD group was lower compared to typically developing ( TD) controls , across all ages. Importantly , the results from Experiments 1 and 2 showed that , although chronological age was not a good predictor for performance of either novel metaphor or metonymy in the cross-sectional design , performance improved when longitudinal data was considered. Correlations between vocabulary knowledge , visuo-spatial abilities and figurative language comprehension abilities were also explored.
