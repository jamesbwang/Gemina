 Background- The clinical hypocholesterolemic effect of nutraceutical compounds ( NCs) containing red yeast rice extracts providing a daily dose of 2.5-10 mg of monacolin K is now well established. For this reason , NCs may be a viable alternative to the statin drugs commonly used to lower cholesterol levels. However , in order to avoid some possible statin-like side effects , most NCs available on the market contain low doses of monacolin K , which could reduce their efficacy. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of a NC containing high doses of monacolin K ( 10 mg) in improving the lipid profile and glucose metabolism when added to the diet versus the diet alone in a group of hypertensive and hyper-cholesterolemic subjects at low cardiovascular risk. Methods- Thirty subjects with grade-1 essential hypertension ( mean age 51.5 ± 7.8 years , 62.9 % males) were enrolled in the treatment group ( NC group). These subjects followed a programmed diet and took one tablet a day of a NC containing red yeast rice , policosanols , resveratrol and chromium picolinate for 1 month and were compared with an equivalent group of subjects that followed only a diet program. Differences in serum total cholesterol ( TC) , low-density- and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDLC and HDLC) , triglycerides ( TG) and blood glucose between groups were compared by analysis of variance. Results- In both groups , a significant reduction of TC , TG and LDLC was observed. In the treatment group from the baseline to the follow-up the reduction of TC ( 230.93 ± 28.0 vs. 188.63 ± 18.1 , p < 0.001) and LDLC ( 153.10 ± 22.5 vs. 116.54 ± 17.7 , p < 0.001) was significantly greater compared to the control group ( differences between treatments = 9.19 % and 12.29 % , respectively); in addition a significant higher reduction in blood glucose ( 89.1 ± 7.6 vs. 83.7 ± 4.6 , p < 0.001) was also observed ( differences between treatments = 4.28 %). HDLC levels remained unchanged in both groups. Conclusions- In summary , the NC containing high doses of monacolin K appeared to be safe , well tolerated and effective at improving lipid and glucose patterns.
