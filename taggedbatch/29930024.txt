 Molecular docking provides a computationally efficient way to predict the atomic structural details of protein-RNA interactions ( PRI) , but accurate prediction of the three-dimensional structures and binding affinities for PRI is still notoriously difficult , partly due to the unreliability of the existing scoring functions for PRI. MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA are more theoretically rigorous than most scoring functions for protein-RNA docking , but their prediction performance for protein-RNA systems remains unclear. Here , we systemically evaluated the capability of MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA to predict the binding affinities and recognize the near-native binding structures for protein-RNA systems with different solvent models and interior dielectric constants ( Ïµ
