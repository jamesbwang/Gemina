 The main aim of the paper is damage detection at the microscale in the anisotropic piezoelectric sensors using surface acoustic waves ( SAWs). A novel technique based on the single input and multiple output of Rayleigh waves is proposed to detect the microscale cracks/flaws in the sensor. A convex-shaped interdigital transducer is fabricated for excitation of divergent SAWs in the sensor. An angularly shaped interdigital transducer ( IDT) is fabricated at 0 degrees and Â± 20 degrees for sensing the convex shape evolution of SAWs. A precalibrated damage was introduced in the piezoelectric sensor material using a micro-indenter in the direction perpendicular to the pointing direction of the SAW. Damage detection algorithms based on empirical mode decomposition ( EMD) and principal component analysis ( PCA) are implemented to quantify the evolution of damage in piezoelectric sensor material. The evolution of the damage was quantified using a proposed condition indicator ( CI) based on normalized Euclidean norm of the change in principal angles , corresponding to pristine and damaged states. The CI indicator provides a robust and accurate metric for detection and quantification of damage.
