 The objective of this work was to compare the composition and production rate of Greek dental solid waste ( DSW) produced by three dentist groups of Xanthi , Greece , defined according to the country of their dental education/training: ( 1) dentists educated in Greece and other European Union ( EU) countries , ( 2) dentists educated in Turkey , and ( 3) dentists educated in former Soviet Union and repatriated to Greece. All DSW produced by a total of 2542 patients in 20 dental practices from Xanthi , Greece , was collected , manually separated , and weighed over a period of four working weeks and classified according to Greek regulations. Production data below are presented as average ( standard deviation in parenthesis). The average unit production rates of total DSW were 415 ( 303) and 51.2 ( 19.1) g/patient/day for dentists educated in Greece and other EU countries , 365 ( 160) and 64.0 ( 21.7) g/patient/day for dentists educated in Turkey , and 302 ( 349) and 54.3 ( 46.8) g/patient/day for dentists educated in former Soviet Union. Daily DSW production was correlated with daily number of patients and regression correlations were produced. Statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test was conducted to compare DSW production medians by the three dentist groups. Dentists educated in Turkey had statistically higher median patient-based unit production rates at Î± = 0.05 for total dental , total hazardous , total infectious , total toxic and domestic-type waste , compared to the other dentist groups.
