 Little is known about functioning of the middle ear with advancing age. To estimate the prevalence and describe tympanometric patterns of sub-clinical middle ear malfunctions , ( S-MEM) in elderly patients. It also assessed clinical factors that could predict S-MEM. Cross-sectional , analytical study of patients aged ≥ 60 years in a tertiary hospital in Nigeria between 2011-2014. Pure tone audiometry ( PTA) , tympanometry and acoustic reflexes were recorded. S-MEM was based on audiometric and tympanometric evident abnormalities. Descriptive , univariate and multivariate analyses performed to detect independent clinical predictors of S-MEM at p-value of < 0.05. 121 patients , M: F of 1.1:1. Mean age was 70.1 ± 6.2 years , 77.7 % were married. Prevalence of S-MEM was 21.5 %. Abnormal tympanometric tracings were type A 21.5 % of elderly Africans had subclinical abnormalities in their middle ear functioning , mostly with type AS tympanogram. Independent clinical predictors of S-MEM included previous head injury , diabetes , history of osteoarthritis of knee joints , and absent acoustic reflex.
