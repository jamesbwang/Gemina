 There is great power and promise for mobile health ( mHealth) technology in the realms of clinical practice and research. By offering the opportunity to reshape the interaction between clinician and patient or researcher and subject , the introduction of this technology allows clinicians and researchers access to larger quantities of more timely and reliable data. The potential developments are significant , and they are ethically relevant. With all technological developments , however , come new sets of ethical risks. In this paper , I assess the ethics of mHealth. I argue that while we have an ethical obligation to advance this work in order to further the quality and scope of care , the use of mHealth technology also presents challenges that must be addressed before and during the use of this technology. After describing the ethical landscape , I offer a pragmatic approach to meeting some of these challenges and minimizing ethical risk by switching from a privacy-centered frame to a consent-centered frame.
