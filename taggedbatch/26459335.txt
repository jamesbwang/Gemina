 The use of antiretroviral therapy ( ART) is a core strategy proposed by the World Health Organization in preventing mother to child transmission ( MTCT) of HIV<pathogen>. This systematic review aimed to examine the enablers and barriers of medication adherence among HIV<pathogen> positive pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. We used the following keywords: HIV<pathogen> AND ( Pregnancy OR Pregnant *) AND ( PMTCT OR `` PMTCT Cascade '' OR `` Vertical Transmission '' OR `` Mother-to-Child '') AND ( Prevent OR Prevention) AND ( HAART OR `` Antiretroviral Therapy '' OR `` Triple Therapy '') AND ( Retention OR Concordance OR Adherence OR Compliance) to conduct electronic searches in the following databases: MEDLINE Complete ( 1916-Dec 2017) , Embase ( 1947-Dec 2017) , Global Health ( 1910-Dec 2017) and CINAHL Complete ( 1937-Dec 2017). Of the four databases searched , 401 studies were identified with 44 meeting the inclusion criteria. Seven studies were added after searching reference lists of included articles , resulting in 51 articles in total. The review demonstrated that stigma , cost of transportation , food deprivation and a woman 's disclosure or non-disclosure of her HIV<pathogen> status to a partner , family and the community , could limit or define the extent of her adherence to prescribed antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy. Furthermore , the review indicated that knowledge of HIV<pathogen> status , either before or during pregnancy , was significantly associated with medication adherence. Women who knew their HIV<pathogen> status before pregnancy demonstrated good adherence while women who found out their HIV<pathogen> infection status during pregnancy were linked with non-adherence to ART. This review revealed several barriers and enablers of adherence among pregnant women taking ART in sub-Saharan Africa. Major barriers included the fear of HIV<pathogen> infection status disclosure to partners and family members , stigma and discrimination. A major enabler of adherence in women taking ART was women 's knowledge of their HIV<pathogen> status prior to becoming pregnant. Enhanced effort is needed to facilitate women 's knowledge of their HIV<pathogen> status before pregnancy to enable disease acceptance and management , and to support pregnant women and her partner and family in dealing with fear , stigma and discrimination about HIV<pathogen>.
