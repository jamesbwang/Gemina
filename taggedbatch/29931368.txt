 There are known associations between inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) and changes in mucosal paracellular permeability. We recently developed a novel catheter that can measure mucosal admittance ( MA). Patients with ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) in clinical remission underwent real-time MA measurement during colonoscopy between June 2014 and July 2015 and were prospectively followed. MA measures were taken from normal-appearing mucosa using the Tissue Conductance Meter ( TCM). We examined relationships between mucosal admittance , clinical parameters at the time of MA measurement , and disease relapse during the follow-up period using the Cox proportional hazards model. We measured baseline MA in 54 patients with UC during remission , with no complications. Of these , 23 patients relapsed during the subsequent follow-up period , at a median of 25.8 Â± 7.6 months. Rectal MA was the only predictor of disease relapse in multivariate analysis ( P = 0.027). The optimal rectal MA cutoff value for relapse was 781.0 ( area under the receiver operating characteristic curve , 0.712) , and in patients who showed lower than normal cutoff values , there was a significantly higher likelihood of relapse compared with other patients ( log-rank test , P < 0.001). High rectal MA measured by TCM is associated with long-term sustained remission. Real-time rectal MA measurement using a novel endoscopy-guided catheter could be a safe and useful means of predicting prognosis for patients with UC in remission.
