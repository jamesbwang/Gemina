 This study investigates the impact of maxillary advancement ( Le Fort I osteotomy) on consonant proficiency in patients with cleft lip and palate ( CLP) and explores how these patients and lay people perceive their speech 1 year post Le Fort I osteotomy. Retrospective group study before and after treatment. All patients with CLP who had undergone Le Fort I osteotomy for maxillary retrognathia between 2007 and 2010 at Karolinska University Hospital , Sweden ( n = 21). Six patients were excluded due to additional malformations and missing data. Two experienced speech and language pathologists assessed consonant proficiency , and speech accuracy was determined by lay listeners from pre- and postoperative standardized audio recordings. The patients ' satisfaction with speech postoperatively was collected from medical records. Percentage of oral consonants correct and acoustic analysis of/ s/ , lay listeners ' opinion , and patients ' satisfaction with speech. One year postoperation , 11 of the 15 patients had improved articulation , especially on the/ s/- sound<symptom> , without speech intervention. The mean percentage of oral consonants correct before treatment ( 82 %) was significantly improved later ( 95 %; P > .01). This assessment was supported by the patients ' satisfaction with speech. However , lay listeners ' opinion on accuracy was inconsistent. Length of maxillary advancement or change in occlusion did not correlate with change in articulation. Maxillary advancement performed to normalize occlusion and facial profile improved consonant proficiency in patients with CLP 1 year postoperation. Lay listeners ' and patients ' perceptions of speech need further exploration.
