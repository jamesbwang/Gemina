 Yeast pathogens are emerging agents of nosocomial as well as community-acquired infections and their rapid and accurate identification is crucial for a better management of high-risk patients and for an adequate treatment. We performed a retrospective review of 156 yeast isolates collected during a 17 months ' period of regular clinical practice at the Microbiology Department of San Camillo Hospital in Treviso , Italy and analyzed by the traditional culture-based method combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry ( MALDI-TOF MS). Out of all the samples collected MALDI-TOF MS was able to characterize with a MT score â‰¥ 1.7 ( accurate result at species level) 12 different yeast and yeast-like species from 140 samples: Accurate identification of microorganisms and the study of their antifungal susceptibility allow to understand the epidemiology of a particular area , permitting the choice of the most appropriate early antifungal treatment.
