 Optimal treatment strategy for the oldest patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL) remains controversial , as this group often is precluded from clinical trials , and population-based studies are limited. All Danish DLBCL-patients ≥ 75 years diagnosed from 2003 to 2012 were identified , using the Danish National Lymphoma Registry ( LYFO). Information regarding baseline characteristics , treatment , comorbidities and outcomes was retrieved from LYFO , the Danish National health registries and medical records. Patients were stratified by age ( 75-79; 80-84 and 85 + years) , comorbidity score and treatment modality ( standard treatment ( R-CHOP/CHOP-like) , less intensive regimens or palliative treatment). A total of 1011 patients were included. Standard treatment was initiated in 64 % , ranging from 83 % among patients aged 75-79 years to 32 % among patient aged 85 + years. With standard treatment , median overall survival ( OS) estimates were 4 · 6 , 2 · 6 , and 1 · 9 years for the age groups 75-79 , 80-84 and 85 + years. Among patient aged 75-79 and 80-84 years , OS was superior with standard treatment , although high comorbidity scores attenuated this association. Among patients aged 85 + years , survival was not influenced by treatment intensity. Patients ≥ 80 years had similar OS regardless of intended ( R-) CHOP dosing , whereas patients of 75-79 years scheduled for full dose had higher OS. Standard treatment was not associated with increased hospitalisation. Standard treatment is feasible with good outcomes in a large proportion of elderly DLBCL-patients. Planned dose reduction in patients aged ≥ 80 years had no negative impact on OS.
