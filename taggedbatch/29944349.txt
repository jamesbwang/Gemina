 Group 10 metal catalysts have shown much promise for the copolymerization of nonpolar with polar alkenes to directly generate functional materials , but access to high copolymer molecular weights nevertheless remains a key challenge toward practical applications in this field. In the context of identifying new strategies for molecular weight control , we report a series of highly polarized P ( V)- P ( III) chelating ligands that manifest unique space filling and electrostatic effects within the coordination sphere of single component Pd polymerization catalysts and exert important influences on ( co) polymer molecular weights. Single component , cationic phosphonic diamide-phosphine ( PDAP) Pd catalysts are competent to generate linear , functional polyethylenes with M
