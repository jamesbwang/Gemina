 The pathomechanisms underlying oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS) diseases are not well-understood , but they involve maladaptive changes in mitochondria-nucleus communication. Many studies on the mitochondria-nucleus cross-talk triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction have focused on the role played by regulatory proteins , while the participation of miRNAs remains poorly explored. MELAS ( mitochondrial encephalomyopathy , lactic acidosis , and stroke-like episodes) is mostly caused by mutation m. 3243A > G in mitochondrial tRNA
