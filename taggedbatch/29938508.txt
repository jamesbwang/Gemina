 A novel photoelectrochemical ( PEC) enzyme immunoassay was designed for the ultrasensitive detection of alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP) based on near-infrared ( NIR) light-excited core-core-shell UCNP@Au @CdS upconversion nanospheres. Plasmonic gold ( Au) between the sandwiched layers was not only utilized as an energy harvester for the collection of the incident light but also acted as an energy conveyor to transfer the energy from upconversion NaYF
