 We tried to identify the function of LINC01614 in lung adenocarcinoma ( LUAD) and reveal its underlying mechanisms. qRT-PCR was applied to assess the expression of LINC016014 in LUAD tissues , noncancerous tissues and cells. Through colony formation assay , MTT assay and apoptosis analysis , we examined the variation of cell proliferation and apoptosis ability after silencing LINC01614. Moreover , the targeting interactions among LINC01614 , miR-217 and FOXP1 were validated via luciferase reporter assay , and then , we regulated the expression of miR-217 and FOXP1 to ascertain their importance in cell proliferation and apoptosis. LINC01614 and FOXP1 were found to be up-regulated in LUAD tumours and cells , whereas miR-217 was down-regulated. The experiment showed that target-specific selectivity exists between LINC01614-miR-217 and miR-217-FOXP1 3 ` UTR. Furthermore , we disclosed that inhibition of LINC01614 could activate miR-217 , which subsequently restrained FOXP1. It was proved that LINC01614 promoted FOXP1 by inhibiting miR-217 , which ultimately stimulated the development of LUAD.
