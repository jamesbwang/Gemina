 We evaluated systemic glucocorticoid exposure and fracture among patients with newly-diagnosed inflammatory and immune-modulated conditions. Using administrative data , inception cohorts of RA , asthma/COPD , IBD , MS , lupus , and sarcoidosis patients age 18-64 years with benefits coverage ≥ 12 months before diagnosis ( 1/1/2005 - 12/31/2012) were followed to clinical fracture , cancer diagnosis , or 12/31/2012. Glucocorticoid users were new to therapy. Fracture incidence rates ( IR) per 1,000 person-years were stratified by prednisone equivalent doses. Cox 's proportional hazards models assessed risk by daily and cumulative dose , and by time since discontinuation , adjusted for baseline characteristics. Most patients ( 72 % of 403,337) had glucocorticoid exposure; 52 % were under age 50. IR ( 95 % confidence intervals ( CI)) of any osteoporotic fracture was elevated at doses < 5 mg/day , IR: 9.33 ( 7.29 , 11.77) versus 0 mg/day , IR: 4.87 ( 4.72 , 5.02)). Fracture rates were elevated at doses < 5 mg/day in patients < 50 years and those ≥ 50 years. In both age groups , fracture risk increased with increasing cumulative exposure , being approximately 2.5-fold higher at cumulative dose ≥ 5400 mg compared to < 675 mg. At ≥ 5400 mg , IR were 5.69 ( 4.32 , 7.35) in patients < 50 years and 17.10 ( 14.97 , 19.46) in older patients. Fracture risk decreased significantly within months following glucocorticoid discontinuation. In patients with a variety of inflammatory conditions , fracture risk increased at doses as low as < 5 mg/day. Risk increased with increasing cumulative exposure and decreased soon following glucocorticoid discontinuation. Trends were similar between patients older and younger than 50 years.
