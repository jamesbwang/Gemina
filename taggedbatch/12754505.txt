 Transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β) regulates reciprocal regulatory T cell ( T reg) and T helper 17 ( Th17) differentiation , the underlying mechanism of which is still not understood. Here , we report that tripartite motif-containing 33 ( Trim33) , a modulator of TGF-β signaling that associates with Smad2 , regulates the proinflammatory function of Th17 cells. Trim33 deficiency in T cells ameliorated an autoimmune disease in vivo
