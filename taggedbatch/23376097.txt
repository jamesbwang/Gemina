 Enzyme catalysis is a complex process involving several steps along the reaction coordinates , including substrate recognition and binding , chemical transformation , and product release. Evidence continues to emerge linking the functional and evolutionary role of conformational exchange processes in optimal catalytic activity. Ligand binding changes the conformational landscape of enzymes , inducing long-range conformational rearrangements. Using functionally distinct members of the pancreatic ribonuclease superfamily as a model system , we characterized the structural and conformational changes associated with the binding of two mononucleotide ligands. By combining NMR chemical shift titration experiments with the chemical shift projection analysis ( CHESPA) and relaxation dispersion experiments , we show that biologically distinct members of the RNase superfamily display discrete chemical shift perturbations upon ligand binding that are not conserved even in structurally related members. Amino acid networks exhibiting coordinated chemical shift displacements upon binding of the two ligands are unique to each of the RNases analyzed. Our results reveal the contribution of conformational rearrangements to the observed chemical shift perturbations. These observations provide important insights into the contribution of the different ligand binding specificities and effects of conformational exchange on the observed perturbations associated with ligand binding for functionally diverse members of the pancreatic RNase superfamily.
