 Graphene oxide ( GO)- based gels are attractive because of their ability to retain individual nanosheet properties in a three-dimensional ( 3D) bulk material. The final morphology and properties of these 3D gel networks depend strongly on the type and density of cross-links , and these gels can be dried and annealed to form aerogels with both high conductivity ( 560 S/m) and high surface area ( 1700 m
