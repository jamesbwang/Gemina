 Treatment with biological therapies increases the incidence of tuberculous disease. The introduction of systematic screening for latent tuberculosis<disease> infection in patients who are to receive these therapies has reduced this risk. In 2016 , the consensus document on the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis<disease> in patients who are candidates for biological treatment was published in Spain. The main objective of this study was to evaluate adherence to these guidelines. Multicenter , descriptive , observational study via an anonymous online survey sent to medical societies involved in biologics. We received 747 responses. Most respondents performed screening at the right time in the right patients ( 93.7 %). Only 36.6 % of respondents requested the appropriate diagnostic test , while 56.3 % correctly recommended chemoprophylaxis. Up to 96 % were familiar with the recommended chemoprophylaxis regimens , while only 63.9 % initiated them at the right time. The specialist area that participated most and screened most patients for latent tuberculosis<disease> infection was rheumatology ( 54 %). In most cases , pulmonologists were involved in an advisory capacity. This study shows poor overall adherence to recommendations , with only 56 % of respondents reporting appropriate compliance. The incidence of tuberculous disease in patients who are to receive biological therapies could be reduced further by emphasizing the importance of the right diagnostic test and use of the diagnostic algorithm for latent tuberculosis<disease> infection.
