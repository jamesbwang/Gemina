 Reversible multicolor displays on solid media using single molecule pigments have been a long-awaited goal. Herein , a new and simple molecular dyad , which can undergo switchable CMY color<symptom> changes<symptom> both in solution and solid substrate upon exposure to light , water/acid , and nucleophiles , is designed and synthesized. The stimuli used in this work can be applied independent of each other , which is beneficial for color<symptom> changes<symptom> without mutual interference. As a comparison , the mixtures of the two molecular switching motifs forming the basis of the dyad were also studied. The dyad greatly outperforms the corresponding mixed system with respect to reversible color-switching on the paper substrate. Its potential for full-color rewritable paper with excellent reversibility has been demonstrated. Legible multicolor prints , that is , high color contrast and resolution , good dispersion , excellent reversibility , were achieved using common water-jet and light-based printers. This work provides a very promising approach for further development of full-color switchable molecules , materials and displays.
