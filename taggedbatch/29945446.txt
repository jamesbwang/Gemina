 Airway inflammation<symptom> has been implicated in evoking progressive<symptom> pulmonary disorders including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) and asthma as a result of exposure to inhaled irritants , characterized by airway fibrosis<disease> , mucus hypersecretion , and loss of alveolar integrity. The current study examined whether oleuropein , a phenylethanoid found in olive leaves , inhibited pulmonary<symptom> inflammation<symptom> in experimental models of interleukin ( IL) -4-exposed bronchial BEAS-2B epithelial cells and ovalbumin ( OVA)- or cigarette smoke ( CS)- exposed BALB/c mice. Nontoxic oleuropein at 1-20 μM diminished eotaxin-1-mediated induction of α-smooth muscle actin and mucin 5AC in epithelial cells stimulated by IL-4 at the transcriptional levels. Oral supplementation of 10-20 mg/kg oleuropein reduced the airway influx of eosinophils and lymphocytes as well as IL-4 secretion in lung promoted by OVA inhalation or CS. In addition , oleuropein suppressed infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils through blocking OVA inhalation- and CS-promoted induction of ICAM-1 , F4/80 , CD68 , and CD11b in airways. OVA-exposed pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> was detected , while alveolar emphysema was evident in CS-exposed mouse lungs. In alveolar epithelial A549 cells exposed to CS extracts , oleuropein attenuated apoptotic cell loss. Collectively , oleuropein inhibited pulmonary<symptom> inflammation<symptom> leading to asthmatic fibrosis<disease> and alveolar emphysema driven by influx of inflammatory cells in airways exposed OVA or CS. Therefore , oleuropein may be a promising anti-inflammatory agent for treating asthma and COPD.
