 The present study aimed to investigate the expression of tumor protein p53 ( p53) , and its mechanism of function , in prostate cancer ( PC). Small interfering RNA ( siRNA) was used to interfere with p53 expression in the PC cell line , DU145. Cell viability and p53 expression were analyzed using cell counting kit-8 ( CCK-8) and western blotting. The effects of p53 expression on the proliferation , migration and adhesion abilities of PC cells were analyzed using Cell Counting kit-8 , Transwell and adhesion assays. Changes in cell proliferation , migration and adhesion ability were observed following treatment with extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK) inhibitor , PD184352 , and janus kinase ( JNK) inhibitor , SP60012. The expression level of p53 declined 24 h after siRNA transfection ( P < 0.05). Furthermore , JNK and ERK , downstream proteins of the focal adhesion kinase ( FAK)- Src proto-oncogene , non-receptor tyrosine kinase ( Src) signaling pathway , were activated. These effects were associated with reduced proliferation , migration and adhesion abilities of PC cells compared with untransfected control cells ( P < 0.05). PD184352 and SP600125 treatments also resulted in reduced proliferation , migration and adhesion abilities of PC cells ( P < 0.05). In conclusion , PC cells exhibited low p53 expression , and the proliferation , migration and adhesion abilities of PC cells were promoted by inhibiting the activation of JNK and ERK. Together , these results suggest that p53 has potential as a therapeutic target in PC.
