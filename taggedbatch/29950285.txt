 With an incidence of approximately 60,000 per year prostate cancer is the most common malignant neoplasm in men with a relatively low mortality rate and a high mean age of primary diagnosis of about 70 years. The disease remains usually clinically occult over a long period of time and generally manifests primarily in a locally advanced or metastasized stage. Due to screening using the PSA level ( prostate specific antigen) in blood serum , diagnosis and therapy nowadays are oftentimes possible at an early stage. The prostate carcinoma is classified using risk groups based on the level of PSA , the local tumor spread and the histological degree of differentiation ( Gleason score). If no metastases are detected during staging a local curative therapy is indicated , provided that the patient is eligible for this due to age , comorbidity and life expectancy. Depending on the risk group of the patient , radical prostatectomy , percutaneous radiotherapy , brachytherapy or active surveillance are available as curative therapy concepts. Focal therapies such as HIFU , electrovaporization or cryotherapy are currently considered to be experimental. If metastases are already present at primary diagnosis , palliative , systemic therapy can be performed with an androgen deprivation therapy and chemotherapy. At an advanced and hormone refractory stage , treatment with an osteotropic radiotracer or palliative radiotherapy can reduce bone metastases and alleviate respective symptoms.
