 To ( 1) determine the proportion of hysterectomy cases with documentation of pessary counseling prior to prolapse surgery and ( 2) identify variables associated with women offered a pessary. The Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative ( MSQC) is a hysterectomy improvement initiative. Hysterectomies from 2013 to 2015 in which prolapse was the principal diagnosis were included. `` Pessary offer '' was defined as documentation showing the patient declined , could not tolerate , or failed a pessary trial. Bivariate analyses were used to compare demographics , medical history , surgical route , concomitant procedures ( colpopexy or colporrhaphy) , and intra- and postoperative complications between women with and without pessary offer. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to determine factors independently associated with pessary offer. Risk-adjusted pessary offer rates by hospital were calculated. The adjusted rate of pessary offer was 25.2 % , ranging from 3 to 76 % per hospital. Bivariate comparisons showed differences between women with and without pessary offer in age , tobacco use , prior pelvic surgery , insurance status , surgical approach , secondary indication for surgery , concomitant prolapse procedure , teaching hospital status and hospital bed size. In logistic regression , odds of pessary offer increased with age > 55 years ( OR 1.45 , 95 % CI 1.12-1.88 , p = 0.006) , Medicare insurance ( OR 1.65 , 95 % CI 1.30-2.10 , p < 0.0001) , and a concomitant procedure ( OR 1.5 , 95 % CI 1.16-1.93 , p = 0.002). Postoperative urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> were more common in patients offered a pessary ( 6.4 % vs. 2.5 % , p < 0.0001) , but other complications were similar. Overall , only one-quarter of hysterectomies for prolapse in MSQC hospitals had documentation of pessary counseling-suggesting an opportunity to improve documentation , counseling regarding pessary use , or both.
