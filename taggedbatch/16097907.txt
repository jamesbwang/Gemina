 Project Quit was a randomized Web-based smoking cessation trial designed and conducted by researchers from the University of Michigan , where its primary outcome was the 7-day point prevalence. One drawback of such an outcome is that it only focuses on smoking behavior over a very short duration , rather than the quitting process over the entire study period. The aim of this study was to consider the number of quit attempts during the 6-month study period as an alternative outcome , which would better reflect the quitting process. We aimed to find out whether tailored interventions ( high vs low) are better in reducing the number of quit attempts for specific subgroups of smokers. To identify interactions between intervention components of smoking cessation and individual smoker characteristics , we employed Poisson regression to analyze the number of quit attempts. This approach allowed us to construct data-driven , personalized interventions. A negative effect of the number of cigarettes smoked per day ( P = .03) and a positive effect of education ( P = .03) on the number of quit attempts were detected from the baseline covariates ( n = 792). Thus , for every 10 extra cigarettes smoked per day , there was a 5.84 % decrease in the expected number of quit attempts. Highly educated participants had a 15.49 % increase in their expected number of quit attempts compared with their low-educated counterparts. A negative interaction between intervention component story and smoker 's education was also detected ( P = .03) , suggesting that a high-tailored story given to highly educated people results in 13.50 % decrease in the number of quit attempts compared with a low-tailored story. A highly individually tailored story is significantly more effective for smokers with a low level of education. This is consistent with prior findings from Project Quit based on the 7-day point prevalence.
