29954049," Although ""Girls are as good as boys at math"" explicitly expresses equality, we predict it could nevertheless suggest that boys have more raw talent. In statements with this subject-complement structure, the item in the complement position serves as the reference point and is thus considered more typical and prominent. This explains why ""Tents are like houses,"" for instance, sounds better than ""Houses are like tents""-people generally think of houses as more typical. For domains about ability, the reference point should be the item that is typically more skilled. We further propose that the reference point should be naturally more skilled. In two experiments, we presented adults with summaries of actual scientific evidence for gender equality in math (Experiment 1) or verbal ability (Experiment 2), but we manipulated whether the reference point in the statements of equality in the summaries (e.g., ""Boys' verbal ability is as good as girls'"") was girls or boys. As predicted, adults attributed more natural ability to each gender when it was in the complement rather than subject position. Yet, in Experiment 3, we found that when explicitly asked, participants judged that such sentences were not biased in favor of either gender, indicating that subject-complement statements must be transmitting this bias in a subtle way. Thus, statements such as ""Girls are as good as boys at math"" can actually backfire and perpetuate gender stereotypes about natural ability."
29954048," ICAP is a theory of active learning that differentiates students' engagement based on their behaviors. ICAP postulates that Interactive engagement, demonstrated by co-generative collaborative behaviors, is superior for learning to Constructive engagement, indicated by generative behaviors. Both kinds of engagement exceed the benefits of Active or Passive engagement, marked by manipulative and attentive behaviors, respectively. This paper discusses a 5-year project that attempted to translate ICAP into a theory of instruction using five successive measures: (a) teachers' understanding of ICAP after completing an online module, (b) their success at designing lesson plans using different ICAP modes, (c) fidelity of teachers' classroom implementation, (d) modes of students' enacted behaviors, and (e) students' learning outcomes. Although teachers had minimal success in designing Constructive and Interactive activities, students nevertheless learned significantly more in the context of Constructive than Active activities. We discuss reasons for teachers' overall difficulty in designing and eliciting Interactive engagement."
29954047," Automatic facial recognition is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in security contexts such as passport control. Currently, Automated Border Crossing (ABC) systems in the United Kingdom (UK) and the European Union (EU) require supervision from a human operator who validates correct identity judgments and overrules incorrect decisions. As the accuracy of this human-computer interaction remains unknown, this research investigated how human validation is impacted by a priori face-matching decisions such as those made by automated face recognition software. Observers matched pairs of faces that were already labeled onscreen as depicting the same identity or two different identities. The majority of these labels provided information that was consistent with the stimuli presented, but some were also inconsistent or provided ""unresolved"" information. Across three experiments, accuracy consistently deteriorated on trials that were inconsistently labeled, indicating that observers' face-matching decisions are biased by external information such as that provided by ABCs."
29954046," In cirrhotic patients, a high serum creatinine value is an independent mortality factor. Similarly, it is predictive of renal insufficiency after liver transplantation, and chronic kidney disease in this situation, is also an independent mortality factor. A relevant evaluation of GFR is currently crucial, particularly in case of end-stage liver disease or liver transplant project, and is key for the decision of double liver-kidney transplantation. Serum creatinine or creatinine-based equations are the most used tools in clinical practice but they significantly overestimate renal function. Equilibrium inulin renal clearance remains the gold standard but is time consuming and expensive. Cystatin C and Cystatin C-based equations are less influenced by muscle mass or bilirubin value, but their dosage is not standardized and is expensive. Pharmacological models using exogenous markers, new kidney biomarkers, Doppler coupled with ultrasounds, and kidney histology may be interesting tools but their indications need to be specified."
29954045," Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a cultural practice defined as the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia for nontherapeutic indications. Due to changing patterns of migration, clinicians in high-income countries are seeing more women from countries where the practice is prevalent. This review aims to understand the sociocultural and health needs of these women and identify opportunities to improve the quality of maternity care for women with FGM. We undertook a systematic review and meta-synthesis of peer-reviewed primary qualitative research to explore the experience and needs of migrant women with FGM receiving maternity care. A structured search of nine databases was undertaken, screened papers appraised, and a thematic analysis undertaken on data extracted from the findings and discussion sections of included papers. Sixteen peer-reviewed studies were included in the systematic review. Four major themes were revealed: Living with fear, stigma, and anxiety; Feelings of vulnerability, distrust, and discrimination; Dealing with past and present ways of life after resettlement; and Seeking support and involvement in health care. The findings suggest that future actions for improving maternity care quality should be focused on woman-centered practice, demonstrating cultural safety and developing mutual trust between a woman and her care providers. Meaningful consultation with women affected by FGM in high-income settings requires cultural sensitivity and acknowledgment of their specific circumstances. This can be achieved by engaging women affected by FGM in service design to provide quality care and ensure woman-focused policy is developed and implemented."
29954044," Although many pregnant women experience fear, worry, or anxiety relating to the upcoming birth, little is known regarding the psychological mechanisms contributing to these experiences. In this study, we wanted to take a first step in trying to identify mechanisms of potential interest. The objective of this cross-sectional study was thus to investigate pain catastrophizing, intolerance of uncertainty, positive worry beliefs, and cognitive avoidance as potential mechanisms predicting fear of birth among pregnant women. A sample of 499 pregnant women, recruited in antenatal health care settings in 2 Swedish regions, completed the Fear of Birth Scale, along with measurements of the mechanisms of interest. Linear and logistic hierarchical regression analyses were used to investigate the extent to which pain catastrophizing, intolerance of uncertainty, positive worry beliefs, and cognitive avoidance predicted fear of birth, both as a continuous and a dichotomous measure. Logistic regression analysis showed high levels of pain catastrophizing and intolerance of uncertainty to be the best predictors of fear of birth, OR 3.49 (95% CI 2.17-5.61) and OR 3.25 (95% CI 2.00-5.27), respectively. Positive beliefs about worry and cognitive avoidance were both correlated with fear of birth as a continuous measure, but did not contribute to the logistic regression model. Pain catastrophizing and intolerance of uncertainty were the most evident predictors of fear of birth. Although preliminary, the findings suggest that interventions targeting catastrophic cognitions and intolerance of uncertainty might be relevant to psychological treatment for fear, worry, or anxiety relating to giving birth."
29954043," Storytelling represents a key element in the creation and propagation of culture. Three main accounts of the adaptive function of storytelling include (a) manipulating the behavior of the audience to enhance the fitness of the narrator, (b) transmitting survival-relevant information while avoiding the costs involved in the first-hand acquisition of that information, and (c) maintaining social bonds or group-level cooperation. We assess the substantial evidence collected in experimental and ethnographic studies for each account. These accounts do not always appeal to the specific features of storytelling above and beyond language use in general. We propose that the specific adaptive value of storytelling lies in making sense of non-routine, uncertain, or novel situations, thereby enabling the collaborative development of previously acquired skills and knowledge, but also promoting social cohesion by strengthening intragroup identity and clarifying intergroup relations."
29954042," This study focuses on the examination of stable isotope biomarkers in human fingernails of travelers who ventured away from Salt Lake City, UT and subsequently returned. Here, we describe three case studies examining: individual travelers (n = 4), paired travelers (n = 2), and a traveler (n = 1) who repeatedly left and returned. Our case studies examined the influences of dietary and drinking water inputs on fingernail stable isotope profiles for reconstructing travel histories. Stable isotope data were compared with theoretical and predictive models that laid the groundwork for anthropological and forensic geospatial reconstruction of travel histories. Drinking water inputs strongly influenced stable isotope profiles and the patterns observed were consistent with reported travel histories. Finally, observed fingernail stable isotope ratio data were consistent with modeled rates of stable isotope turnover and transition to expected values for the new environment. The results of our study further support the use of fingernail tissues for travel history reconstruction."
29954041, Fragility fractures are associated with a substantial mortality and morbidity. Because of the high prevalence of comorbidities and a high risk of complications the application of geriatric principles in the complex treatment of these patients is vital. The last years have seen a paradigm shift in the treatment of fragility fractures from an orthopedic disorder towards an orthogeriatric syndrome. This article reviews the orthogeriatric principles of treating fragility fractures.
29954032,"  Scientific publications are important for the advancement in medicine. Surgical disciplines including cardiac surgery are frequently considered not scientifically leading. However, a specific comparison between surgical and nonsurgical disciplines has not yet been performed. We thus compared scientific output of German departments of cardiac surgery with nonsurgical cardiology departments and surgical departments not addressing the heart (general surgery) of 34 universities in Germany.  For each university, the personnel working at the different departments were identified on the internet homepage in 2014. We searched for publications of these persons in 2011 to 2013 on PubMed, identified author position, coauthors, and type of article, as well as journal impact factor (JIF).  There were 931 academic persons in cardiac surgery, 1,486 in general surgery, and 1,814 in cardiology with 12,096 publications related to these persons on PubMed. Cardiology published most manuscripts, including manuscripts from research conducted (first author), initiated (senior author), or both. Cardiac surgery had the least publications and had fewer authors from other departments or institutions. The average JIF was higher in cardiology compared with the two surgical disciplines. However, relating the number of publications to the number of employees in the departments, the differences were no longer apparent.  We conclude that the number of publications in German universities appears to be a function of the number of academic personnel and not of the discipline. The lower JIFs in surgery may be due to the smaller surgical fields and/or due to less high impact interdisciplinary/interinstitutional publications in surgery."
29954031,"  Minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (MIILE) is increasingly being used in the treatment of middle or lower esophageal cancer. Hand-sewn purse-string stapled anastomosis is a classic approach in open esophagectomy. However, this procedure is technically difficult under thoracoscopy. The hardest part is delivering the anvil into the esophageal stump. Herein, we report an approach to performing this step under thoracoscopy.  A total of 257 consecutive patients who underwent MIILE between April 2013 and July 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. The operator hand sewed the purse string using silk thread under thoracoscopy, and the 25-mm circular stapler was passed through the anterior axillary line at the fourth intercostal space to finish the side-to-end gastroesophageal anastomosis. Patient demographics, intraoperative data, postoperative complications were evaluated.  The mean operative time, thoracoscopy time, and anvil fixation time was 307.0 ± 34.3, 155.4 ± 21.5, and 7.1 ± 1.6 minute, respectively. The anastomotic leak and anastomotic stricture occurred in 6.6% (17 of 257) and 3.9% (10 of 257) of patients, respectively. There was no intraoperative death; one case was death of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) for conduit gastric leakage on the 21st postoperative day.  Using the hand-sewn purse-string stapled anastomotic technique for MIILE is feasible and relatively safe in patients with middle or lower esophageal cancer."
29954030,"  Transthoracic device closure (TTDC) and surgical repair with right infra-axillary thoracotomy (SRRIAT) or with right submammary thoracotomy (SRSMT) are all the primary alternative treatments for restrictive perimembranous ventricular septal defect (pmVSD). However, few studies have compared them in terms of effectiveness and complications.  Patients with restrictive pmVSD undergoing TTDC, or SRRIAT, or SRSMT from March 2016 to February 2017 were retrospectively reviewed in our cardiac center. There were no differences in age (1.3 ± 1.2 vs 1.1 ± 1.1 vs 1.2 ± 1.1 years), gender (35/37 vs 30/33 vs 29/29), body weight (8.3 ± 2.6 vs 8.2 ± 2.4 vs 8.1 ± 2.5 kg), and size of VSD (4.2 ± 1.1 vs 5.2 ± 1.3 vs 5.1 ± 1.2 mm) distribution between the three groups.  The procedure success rates were similar in the three groups. The TTDC group had the shortest operative time, postoperative mechanical ventilation time, duration of intensive care, postoperative length of hospital stay, medical cost, and length of the incision. There were no significant differences in terms of operative time, aortic cross-clamping time, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), blood transfusion volume, mechanical ventilation time, duration of intensive care, duration of hospital stays, pleural fluid drainage, or cost between the SRSMT and SRRIAT groups. No significant differences were noted in terms of major adverse events.  TTDC, SRRIAT, and SRSMT all showed excellent outcomes and cosmetic appearances for selected VSD patients. TTDC had advantages over SRRIAT and SRSMT in terms of short operation duration and smaller incision size and shorter durations of intensive care and hospital stays."
29954029," Filming surgeries for teaching purposes, publications, and patient records has become increasingly popular as the systems for digital recording have evolved, becoming high-quality systems, both smaller and lighter. Digital recording allows long-term storage, retrieval, and database organization. In addition, sharing digital contents has also become easier since video sharing sites and social networks make it possible to upload these contents onto the Internet. We describe a simple and economical system for surgeons to record surgeries in high definition under sterile conditions without any interference with the surgeon's line of vision."
29954028," Longitudinal changes in compensatory and anticipatory postural adjustments around the knee were investigated from rupture of ACL until return to play after reconstruction. Twelve ACL-injured participants (ACL-P) were asked to respond to unpredictable and predictable perturbations before (T1), 2 (T2) and 6 months after (T3) reconstruction. Twelve healthy participants served as controls. Compensatory and anticipatory latencies of vastus lateralis (VL) and medialis (VM) were measured with respect to the arrival of perturbations. ACL-P showed delayed compensatory latencies compared to controls at T1 for VL (101±32 ms vs 63±7 ms) and VM (117±36 ms vs 75±17 ms) and at T2 for VL (94±20 ms vs 63±7 ms) and VM (94±27 ms vs 71±11 ms). ACL-P showed earlier anticipatory latencies than controls for VL at T1 (-69±44 ms vs -12±12 ms) and T2 (-46±17 ms vs -16±12 ms). At T3, ACL-P showed delayed compensatory latencies for VL (91±18 ms vs 56±21 ms) and VM (95±13 ms vs 66±4 ms), whilst anticipatory latencies were restored. Rehabilitation should address delayed compensatory responses."

29954025," The sagittal split osteotomy (SSO) is an indispensable tool in the correction of dentofacial abnormalities. In elective orthognathic surgery, it is important that surgeons inform patients about the risk of complications related to inferior alveolar nerve damage and unfavorable split. The purpose of this article is to describe a novel, hybrid technique to SSO by combining a reciprocating saw and piezoelectric devices with several advantages over traditional ""pure"" methods (osteotomies performed by reciprocating saw or piezoelectric devices only) in terms of precision, rapidity, easier splitting, and decreased complications related to inferior alveolar nerve damage and bad split with reduced overall morbidity. The level of evidence was Level IV, therapeutic study."
29954024," Without well recognizing the vascular territories of the perforator, surgery might damage the pedicle and diminish flap survival. This study described a transillumination method for intraoperative mapping of the subfascial plexus of the perforator in the head and neck reconstruction with an anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap and also compared the perioperative outcomes and complications of the method with those of the conventional two-pedicle ALT flap. Between January 2011 and December 2017, 26 patients who underwent head and neck reconstruction with ALT flaps were evaluated as follows: 13 underwent the transillumination method (case group), and 13 (age- and sex-matched) underwent standard two-pedicle flap procedures (control group). Demographic factors, diagnosis, flap size, recipient site, perioperative data, and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups. There was no significant difference in age, sex, diagnosis, recipient sites, and flap size between the case and control groups. Regarding the perioperative outcomes, the harvesting time was significantly shorter in the case group than in the control group (60 vs. 100 minutes, "
29954023," A decision tree was constructed to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of grafting techniques used to prevent Frey Syndrome. The authors performed a sensitivity analysis to calculate what the probability of preventing Frey Syndrome would have to be and maximum costs associated with using grafting techniques to warrant their use as more ""cost-effective"" choice than using neither. Decision pathways utilized were uses of (1) free fat graft (FFG), (2) acellular dermis, and (3) no grafting. The probability of developing Frey syndrome and costs were extracted from previous studies to construct the decision tree. The primary effectiveness was the ICER of FFG or acellular dermis to prevent Frey syndrome. The initial outcomes included preventing Frey syndrome (effectiveness = 1) or developing Frey syndrome (effectiveness = 0). Compared with not using a graft, the ICER of using FFG and acellular dermis were $10,628 and $50,813, respectively. Frey syndrome was found in 2.6% of patients postoperatively in FFG group, 9.8% of patients in acellular dermis group, and 30.7% of patients who did not have a graft. The ICER shows absolute dominance of FFG with lower cost and high effectiveness over acellular dermis. This economic evaluation strongly supports the use of FFG over acellular dermis as cost-effective approach for prevention of postparotidectomy Frey syndrome."
29954022," The subciliary and skin pinch approaches are the most widely accepted techniques for treating dermatochalasis of the lower eyelid. Direct excision (DE) is an accepted method for treating festoons; however, it is not a popular technique for the treatment of dermatochalasis and pigment of the lower lid. DE of the lower lid offers a safe and excellent aesthetic result for dermatochalasis and pigment of the lower lid, without causing lower lid malposition, which can occur with more traditional methods. In addition to being able to remove significantly more skin without risking lower lid malposition, this procedure allows for removal of the most pigmented and poorly textured skin overlying the nasojugal groove. It is an effective alternative to the conventional subciliary and skin pinch approaches."
29954021," The use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has become increasingly commonplace in facial plastic surgery for the treatment of androgenic alopecia (AGA). However, this treatment remains novel with a range of application techniques and outcomes described in the literature. Herein, the authors systematically review the existing literature on the use and efficacy of PRP for AGA. Systematic review of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases was performed. Case reports were excluded. Twenty-four papers met inclusion criteria for this study: 8 randomized control trials and 16 prospective cohort studies. Twenty-one studies used clinical criteria to diagnose AGA, while three used confirmatory biopsies. PRP was injected with or without the use of a numbing agent, and most studies performed multiple injections (three or more separated by several weeks). Twenty-one studies reported positive outcomes by objective criteria (88%), while three suggested that there was no clinical improvement, although in two of these studies patients still reported increased satisfaction. There were no complications reported other than transient edema/erythema and pain/headache associated with the procedure. The existing literature suggests that PRP is a low-risk intervention to treat AGA associated with good patient satisfaction and objective improvements in outcomes. Further research is needed to optimize preparation and delivery methods as well as standardize measurements of clinical outcomes."
29954020," Despite considerable progress concerning pharmaceutical therapeutic options, many COPD patients show a markedly reduced quality of life and increased mortality risk. This workshop aimed to identify COPD-specific factors impeding an improved mode of care for patients with COPD. Such factors are: the generally lower social and educational status of the majority of COPD patients; the stigma of COPD as a self-inflicted disease (""smoker's lung""); the strict sectoral separation within the German health care system. In the second part the workshop tried to identify ways to improve the care of COPD patients. Use of health information technology, improved communication between care givers and patients as well as between the health care sectors, integrating rehabilitation and establishing self-management education are factors within an integrated patient-centered approach. In summary, an integrated management of the individual patient with COPD including multi-professional teams should contribute to optimizing the quality of COPD care."
29954018,"  Stress increases the risk of developing and maintaining alcohol addiction. Mechanism for reacting to, and coping with, stress in persons with alcohol addiction are an important factor enabling them to maintain abstinence in everyday life. Also of Relevance for abstinence, and in particular craving for alcohol, is the severity of the dependence. Numerous studies have focused on the duration of abstinence, but not on the severity of the disease. This study investigates if, in addition to abstinence duration, also the severity of the alcohol addiction influences stress responsiveness and ability to cope with stress. Another objective is to ascertain in which patients such an influence can be found. The results can shed light on the complex bidirectional relationship between alcoholism and stress, but are also potentially useful in treating patients with this disease. In a cross-sectional design, 64 alcohol-dependent patients and 30 healthy controls were examined. The alcoholics sample was divided in two groups according to a duration of abstinence of seven days and, 70 days. Each group was further divided in a subgroup of individuals with mild to moderate alcohol addiction and in a subgroup of patients with severe alcohol addiction (A7-severe and A70-severe). Using the Trierer Social Stress Test (TSST), all participants were subjected to acute stress. Parameters measured were salivary cortisol, skin conductance -response, heart rate, addiction-related variables (addiction severity, duration of alcohol abuse, drinking quantity, craving, liver enzymes, family history of alcoholism, number of therapies, smoking), psychopathological variables (anxiety, depression, live events, personality disorders), acute and long-term stress coping, and level of strain on everyday life. In patients with severe addiction, the reaction to stress is weaker and slightly retarded, but also of a longer duration than that patients with mild and moderate addiction and of healthy controls. This is independent of the length of abstinence (7 days and 70 days). In severely ill patients, strategies for coping with acute stress differed from those of the other groups in that they consisted in stronger flight and avoidance responses, a stronger need for social support, and a more intense mental preoccupation. Increased levels of social tension, lack of social recognition, and isolation indicated chronic stress. Patients with severe alcohol addiction also showed a more pronounced familial predisposition, stronger craving, increased anxiety, a longer history of alcohol abuse, and a higher frequency of incisive life events than patients with mild to moderate alcohol addiction. The results indicate that a more differentiated evaluation of stress responsiveness and stress coping in persons with an alcohol addiction not only length of abstinence, but also severity of disease have to be taken into account. Further research is necessary to adjust treatment accordingly."
29954017," Neuropsychological assessment should be an integral component of clinical psychiatric diagnostics. Yet, the commonly used tests have not been investigated adequately for this population so far. The current study evaluated a clinically approved neuropsychological test battery by analyzing data on 226 mentally ill patients using factor and regression analyses. The extraction of three factors (Speed, Memory, and Executive Functions) proved to be adequate as the tests could be allocated properly. Regression analysis revealed an economical basis assessment consisting of three tests (TAP Alertness, VLMT, and Matrices Test). Based on acceptance, economy, and factorial structure aspects, we recommend the investigated test battery for neuropsychological assessment of psychiatric and psychosomatic patients."
29954016," Carbon monoxide poisoning is a very common intoxication worldwide. Its clinical manifestations vary from symptoms like mild headache and dizziness to more serious issues including death. Less well known are symptoms that occur with a delay of 2-40 days, such as movement disorders, cognitive impairment or affective disorders. In this article, we present a case of carbon monoxide poisoning with a delayed neurological sequela. The following review summarizes the literature on clinical presentation, diagnostic options, pathophysiology and therapy of this disease."
29954013," In the 2015 mass migration from Syria and neighboring countries, Germany received an unprecedented number of 4,76,649 asylum applications. As many of the refugees arrived in Southern Germany via the Austrian border, the city of Munich was faced with the majority of Germany's inflow of war refugees and their complex health issues. Among the refugees were a high number of children. Their main health issues were infectious diseases and surgical procedures due to trauma, but we also encountered complex chronic diseases. This report describes clinical history, signs and symptoms, diagnostics, and treatment of six pediatric patients with untreated inborn errors of metabolism (IEM): phenylketonuria, biotinidase deficiency, HMG-CoA lyase deficiency, mucopolysaccharidosis type II, and mucopolysaccharidosis type VI. Since early diagnosis and treatment is essential in IEM, both delayed diagnosis and inadequate therapy in refugee children may lead to significant brain injury, organ damage, and even death. Severe neurological sequelae in both phenylketonuria and HMG-CoA lyase deficiency could have been prevented by newborn screening. Screening programs are necessary to improve the prognoses for refugee children. European Union governments and involved health care systems should pursue early diagnosis and treatment in pediatric refugees regarding IEM to prevent neurological long-term sequelae."
29954012," Venomous and hematophagous animals use their venom or saliva for survival, to obtain food, and for self-defense. Venom and saliva from these animals are cocktails of bioactive molecules primarily composed of proteins and peptides. These molecules are called toxins because they cause unwanted consequences on prey. They exhibit unique, diverse, and specific biological activities that perturb normal physiological processes of their prey and host. However, the potential of toxins as inspirations for the development of therapeutic agents or pharmacological tools has also long been recognized. In addition to their small size, the exquisite selectivity and structural stability of toxins make them attractive as starting molecule in the development of therapeutic and diagnostic agents. Drug discovery and development from venomous and hematophagous animals against cardiovascular diseases have been particularly successful. Some of the notable success include antihypertensive (captopril and enalapril) and antiplatelet agents (tirofiban and eptifibatide), as well as anticoagulants (lepirudin and bivalirudin). Highlighted in this review are many venom or saliva-derived cardiovascular-active proteins and peptides of therapeutic interest, including those that are currently in preclinical stages and those that have been approved by FDA and currently in the market. The authors attempt to summarize their structure, function, mechanism of action, and development with respect to cardiovascular diseases."
29954011," Despite an abundance of literature on the risk of a first venous thromboembolic event (VTE) in autoimmune diseases, specific recommendations about managing VTE in autoimmune diseases are lacking. This article aimed to collect evidence on the risk of recurrent VTE in patients with autoimmune diseases. The authors searched PubMed/Embase for studies including patients with VTE and autoimmune diseases as an exposure or studies including patients with autoimmune diseases in which recurrent VTE was one of the outcomes. Eleven articles were selected from 4,739 unique abstracts. Of the 11 studies, 3 reported time-dependent rates. Two studies collected rates of recurrence in Behcet's disease, reporting a 5-year recurrence risk between 35 and 40%. However, the 5-year recurrence risk was lower than 10% in patients treated with immunosuppressant medication, while two studies suggested frequent recurrence in patients on only anticoagulant therapy. The other study reporting time-dependent incidence concerned patients with inflammatory bowel disease and index VTE. The 5-year risk of recurrent VTE was 33.4%, yielding a hazard ratio of 1.7 versus controls. All studies were retrospective and therefore risk may overestimate recurrence risk in comparison with known prospective cohort studies. There are insufficient data to make confident recommendations about the management of recurrent VTE prevention in patients with autoimmune diseases in general. The overall VTE risk profile, lower effectiveness of anticoagulants, and the observation that immunosuppression lowered risk of recurrence in patients with Behcet's disease seem to warrant immunosuppressant therapy over anticoagulation as a first consideration when preventing VTE recurrence in these patients."
29954010," Chemokine CX3CL1 (fractalkine) may be an important factor linking thyroid status and bone remodeling, through tetrac, a derivative of thyroxine. This study explores the relationship between serum fractalkine levels and parameters of thyroid status and bone in premenopausal women with Graves' disease (GD) in comparison to healthy controls. This cross-sectional study included three premenopausal female groups: active GD; cured GD, and healthy age-, gender-, and BMI-matched controls. Measurement of serum fractalkine levels (Quantikine"
29954009,"  Peroneus brevis muscle flap is a distinguished, distally based safe flap that can be manipulated to cover small defects in the leg and ankle. For large-sized defects, a more distal, larger flap is required either locally or distantly.  Forty-two distally based peroneus brevis muscle flaps were elevated in 42 patients (30 males and 12 females) with major lower leg, ankle, and proximal foot defects of 6 to 15 cm in length and 6 to 12 cm in width. Anatomical findings were recorded as number, size, and sources of blood supply, entry sites, the lowermost two arterial supplies, internal distribution of blood supply to the muscle, the relationship between external and internal distribution of the blood vessels, the length of the muscle, the entry site of the main artery, and the splitting of the proximal portion of the peroneus brevis muscle to increase its width to sufficiently cover large defects.  The anatomical findings suggested that the muscle can be safely extended to cover a large defect in the leg, ankle, or proximal foot. In addition, the longitudinal splitting of the muscle increases its width by up to three times, making it an excellent long-surviving flap to cover a large defect.  A distally based peroneus brevis muscle flap has a rich blood supply and safely reaches the proximal foot, with a secure splitting to cover large defects in the leg, ankle, and proximal foot."
29954008,"  The aim of this study was to propose a novel, comprehensive, macroscopic classification for bile duct lesions.  A two-stage protocol was designed. In Stage I, a retrospective study (September 2013 to September 2015) of patients with bile duct lesions detected by peroral cholangioscopy (POCS) was performed. A total of 315 images with at least 6 months of follow-up were recorded, analyzed, and correlated to histology, and were classified as non-neoplastic (one of three types, 1 - 3) or neoplastic (one of four types, 1 - 4) based on morphological and vascular patterns. In Stage II, a prospective, nonrandomized, double-blind study was performed from December 2015 to December 2016 to validate the proposed classification. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively), and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR + and LR - , respectively) were calculated (gold standard: 6-month follow-up). Inter- and intraobserver agreement (kappa value, κ) among experts and non-experts were calculated.  171 patients were included (65 retrospective; 106 prospective). In Stage I, 28/65 cases were neoplastic and 37 /65 were non-neoplastic, according to the final diagnosis. In Stage II, 56/106 were neoplastic with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR + , and LR - for neoplastic diagnosis of 96.3 %, 92.3 %, 92.9 %, 96 %, 12.52, and 0.04, respectively. The proposed classification presented high reproducibility among observers, for both neoplastic and subtypes categories. However, it was better for experts (κ > 80 %) than non-experts (κ 64.7 % - 81.9 %). The novel classification system could help physicians to distinguish non-neoplastic from neoplastic bile duct lesions."
29954003," A tube dysfunction is a common medical issue and can promote chronic otitis media. With the implementation of the Balloon dilation a treatment of the chronic tube dysfunction was set. In the present study significance of this method was assessed, especially questioning the success in practical terms of tympanic membrane retraction. In a retrospective study, in a period of assessment from 2011 until 2016, the data of 81 patients, who underwent Balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube due to chronic tube dysfunction with regard to a preoperative presence of tympanic membrane retraction were evaluated. The success of the Balloon dilation was judged due to the capability of a postoperative SVT- Test and the patients' self-assessment. With an average postoperative period of four months, the data of 13 patients were analyzed based on presence of pre- and postoperative tympanic membrane retraction. The treatment occurred at all cases without complications. In patients with chronic tube dysfunction the method revealed an improvement of 46 %, while 31 % of the patients with tympanic membrane retraction showed an improvement of the middle ear ventilation. Subjectively perceived 54 % of the patients marked an improvement of their clinical symptoms. In spite of a self-assessed improvement in 54 % only 31 % of the patients with chronic membrane retraction showed an objectively measurable success. To evaluate the question if combination with other middle ear surgeries shows better results, further studies, including more patients and data, are required."
29954002," The implementation of the Preventive Health Care Act 2015 requires framework agreements between social insurances and ministries on the state level (Länder). This article analyses the 15 agreements already concluded and provides an overview of similarities and differences between states. We conducted a qualitative content analysis for all 15 agreements. In a first step, we compared the agreements with the model agreement that had informed the negotiations in all states, and identified for each paragraph of the agreement divergent content. In a second step, we compared the divergent content and built subcategories. Third, we classified similarities and differences of each category. For this article, we selected 4 categories: goals and fields of action, committees and regulatory structures, cooperation requirements, cooperation with further actors. All agreements refer to the nationally agreed health goals, some define further, state-specific goals. Furthermore, the agreements provide regulations regarding the goal definition process: some processes only include the subscribers of the agreement, while others involve all relevant stakeholders. New regulatory structures are created in almost all states, but their institutional design and mode of interaction vary highly between state. In 4 states the new structures aim at establishing a dialogue, in 3 states, the goal is to enable coordination, and in 7 states decision-making bodies are set up. Almost all agreements are missing concrete commitments regarding cooperation with other relevant actors on state and local level. Most agreements are very general and their binding character is low. The agreements merely set the framework that now needs to be filled. Hence, evaluating the actual implementation of the agreements will only be possible in a few years."
29954001," Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The development of preventive strategies in CRC has been the subject of much research. Multiple studies have shown an association between diabetes and CRC. In addition to its glucose-lowering properties, metformin might have an additional role in the prevention and treatment of CRC. OUR OBJECTIVE: was to summarize findings on role of metformin in colorectal cancer. We conducted a systematic review of the PubMed and Cochrane databases from January 2005 to December 2017 in search for studies on the association between metformin and CRC. Of the total of 189 studies identified by the search, we excluded 123 studies and reviewed the remaining 66 studies on cell lines, animals, patients with diabetes, and healthy subjects. In vitro and animal studies have shown a protective effect of metformin use on the incidence of CRC and amplification of the therapeutic effects of CRC chemotherapy. Studies on patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin analyzed data on total of 146 496 patients. The results of those studies on the role of metformin in CRC suggest risk reduction and potential applications within therapeutic regimens, although some of those are conflicting. Further studies are warranted to define the role of metformin in both prevention and treatment of CRC."
29954000," High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy may provide effective respiratory management of hypoxemic respiratory failure in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) with a do-not-intubate (DNI) order. The aim was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of HFNC for these patients. We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients requesting a DNI order for hypoxemic respiratory failure associated with ILD, comparing treatment with HFNC and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). Outcomes measured were 30-day survival, in-hospital mortality, temporary interruption and discontinuation of the treatment at the patient's request, adverse events, oral intake, and communication ability at the end of life. A total of 84 patients (HFNC, n = 54; NPPV, n = 30) were analyzed. Neither 30-day survival (HFNC 31.5% vs. NPPV 30.0%; p = 0.86) nor in-hospital mortality (HFNC 79.6% vs. NPPV 83.3%; p = 0.78) differed significantly. The temporary interruption and discontinuation rates were significantly lower in the HFNC group than in the NPPV group (3.7 vs. 23.3%; p = 0.009 and 0 vs. 10%; p = 0.043, respectively), and that group had significantly fewer adverse events. Among patients who died in the hospital, those treated with HFNC had significantly better oral intake and ability to converse until just before death. HFNC had a survival rate equivalent to that of NPPV and was better tolerated by patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure associated with ILD who had a DNI order. HFNC allowed patients to eat and converse until just before death, suggesting that HFNC in these patients is a reasonable palliative treatment."
29953999," The prevalence of affective disorders such as depression and anxiety is particularly high in patients with autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and hidradenitis suppurativa. A dysregulated immune response has been linked to the precipitation of depression in many patient populations. However, studies examining the extent to which the underlying skin disease inflammatory processes contribute to depression and a subsequent decline in quality of life are limited. The published literature over the past 5 years was reviewed for evidence of a relationship between depression and inflammatory processes in the context of skin pathology. The findings, particularly the evidence from interventional clinical trials of targeted anti-cytokine therapies, suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with several skin diseases may be causally linked with the coexistent depressive symptomology."
29953998," Feasibility study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Adjustable Transobturator Male System (ATOMS) after failed surgical devices for male stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Thirty patients were implanted with ATOMS after they were implanted with surgical device/s previously. SUI severity was evaluated as dryness (0-1 pad/day), mild (2 pads/day), moderate (3-5 pads/day), or severe (≥6 pads/day). Change in pad-test and pad-count after adjustment, operative parameters, patient satisfaction, and number and grade of complications were investigated. Previous failed treatment methods were artificial urinary sphincter (AUS; n = 19), Advance (n = 10), and Virtue (n = 1). Six cases had multiple previous treatments. Preoperative SUI was mild 6 (20%), moderate 11 (36.7%), and severe 13 (43.3%). Median pad-test decreased from 435 mL baseline to 10 mL after adjustment and pad-count from 4 to 0. Dry-rate was 76.7 and 83.3% declared satisfied. Postoperative SUI distribution was mild in 3 (10%) and moderate in 4 (13.3%). No patient had urinary retention after catheter removal. Complications presented in 4 (13.3%; 3 grade-I, 1 grade-II). After a median of 24 months follow-up, no system experienced infection or urethral erosion and 1 (3.3%) was removed for inefficacy. Based on short-term efficacy and patient satisfaction, ATOMS can be a realistic alternative for male SUI after other failed systems, including AUS. The absence of urethral erosion and limited infective problems makes this alternative attractive for cases with previous failed treatments."
29953997," Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-me) is a synthetic triterpenoid that has been shown to suppress various cancers and inflammation. It has been implicated for the suppression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-mediated signaling, which plays crucial roles in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previously, we showed that hepatitis B virus (HBV) large surface protein (LHB) variant W4P promotes carcinogenesis and tumor progression through STAT3 activation. Thus, we examined the anti-cancer activity of CDDO-me against HCC using W4P-LHB-expressing NIH3T3 cells and HepG2 and Huh7 HCC cell lines. CDDO-me exerted cytotoxic activity against W4P-LHB-expressing NIH3T3 cells, HepG2 cells, and Huh7 cells, and induced apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating its anti-cancer activity against HCC. Sublethal concentrations of CDDO-me suppressed STAT3 activation by W4P-LHB ectopic expression and interleukin-6 treatment in W4P-LHB-NIH3T3 and Huh7 cells respectively. The suppression of STAT3 activation by CDDO-me in W4P-LHB-NIH3T3 cells was further confirmed by decreased cyclin D1 protein levels and increased p21 and p53 mRNA synthesis. In addition, CDDO-me treatment resulted in decreased cell migration and colony formation in in vitro assays using W4P-LHB-NIH3T3, HepG2, or Huh7 cell lines, supporting its anti-cancer activity through STAT3 inhibition. Furthermore, -CDDO-me administration significantly suppressed tumor growth induced by W4P-LHB-expressing NIH3T3 cells in nude mice, confirming its anti-cancer activity. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that CDDO-me is capable of suppressing STAT3 activation in HCC cells and cells transformed by the natural variant of HBV protein. The results suggest that CDDO-me can be a potential therapeutic agent against HCC, especially tumors related to HBV mutations."
29953994," To evaluate papillary, peripapillary, and macular vasculature with optical coherence tomography angiography in preperimetric (PPG), primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), and normal eyes, and to assess diagnostic ability and associations among the vasculature and structural damage. This was an observational, cross-sectional study. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell complex thickness, whole-image (wiVD), inside disc (idVD), peripapillary (ppVD), and macular vessel densities were obtained. Analysis of variance, post hoc test, and Pearson coefficient were used. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and cut-offs were calculated. Thirteen healthy, 39 PPG, and 19 POAG eyes were included. Papillary and peripapillary VD were lower in POAG eyes in all parameters analyzed. wiVD in PPG eyes (52.37 ± 5.04%) was significantly decreased compared to healthy eyes (58.02 ± 2.02%, p < 0.05). AUC ranged from 0.62 to 0.90; the established cut-off values were 56% for wiVD, 55% for idVD, and 62% for ppVD. Pearson's correlation coefficient showed a direct correlation between the papillary or peripapillary VD and RNFL thickness. Vessel densities in POAG eyes are significantly lower than in healthy eyes, and they show good discriminatory abilities. A diminished microvascular network is associated with RNFL thinning more strongly in POAG than in PPG eyes."
29953993," Estradiol, produced by aromatase (CYP19A1), is very important for reproduction. Folpet, captan, and captafol belong to the phthalimide class of fungicides. They are used to protect the leaves of plants or fruits. They could be endocrine disruptors and may disrupt CYP19A1 activity. In the present study, we investigated the effects of folpet, captan, and captafol on estradiol production and human CYP19A1 activity in JEG-3 cells. Folpet, captan, and captafol decreased estradiol production in JEG-3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Folpet, captan, and captafol inhibited human CYP19A1 with inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 3.55, 10.68, and 1.14 μmol/L respectively. These chemicals competitively inhibited human CYP19A1. Molecular docking simulation analysis showed that they tended to bind to the steroid-binding pocket of the CYP19A1. However, the required concentrations may not be relevant to the negligible systemic exposures in humans to these chemicals. Folpet, captan, and captafol are potential inhibitors of human CYP19A1."
29953992," Systemic endemic mycoses cause high rates of morbidity and mortality in certain regions of the world and the real impact on global health is not well understood. Diagnosis and management remain challenging, especially in low-prevalence settings, where disease awareness is lacking. The main challenges include the variability of clinical presentation, the fastidious and slow-growing nature of the fungal pathogens, the paucity of diagnostic tests, and the lack of options and toxicity of antifungal drugs. Coccidioidomycosis and paracoccidioidomycosis are restricted to the Americas only, and while histoplasmosis and blastomycosis also occur predominantly in the Americas, these mycoses have also been reported on other continents, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Talaromycosis is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions in South-East Asia and southern China. Systemic endemic mycoses causing pulmonary disease are usually acquired via the airborne route by inhalation of fungal spores. Infections can range from asymptomatic or mild with flu-like illnesses to severe pulmonary or disseminated diseases. Skin involvement is frequent in patients with paracoccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, sporotrichosis, and talaromycosis and manifests as localized lesions or diffuse nodules in disseminated disease, but can also occur with other endemic mycoses. Culture and/or characteristic histopathology from clinical samples is the diagnostic standard for endemic mycoses. Immunological assays are often not available for the diagnosis of most endemic mycoses and molecular amplification methods for the detection of fungal nucleic acids are not standardized at present. The first-line treatment for mild to moderate histoplasmosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, sporotrichosis, and talaromycosis is itraconazole. Severe illness is treated with amphotericin B. Patients with severe coccidioidomycosis should receive fluconazole. Treatment duration depends on the specific endemic mycosis, the severity of disease, and the immune status of the patient, ranging between 6 weeks and lifelong treatment."
29953991," There are significant epidemiological and biological differences between breast cancer in blacks and whites which have wide-reaching implications for the institution of an effective cancer screening programme in Nigeria. The aim of this study was to describe the clinicopathologic features of breast cancer diagnosed in our facility and to discuss their implications for cancer screening. A retrospective review of the forms, slides, and results of breast cancer cases received in our facility over an 8-year period was carried out, as well as a systematic review of the characteristics of breast cancer in Nigeria, Africa, the US, and the UK. A total of 832 cancers were seen with a mean age of 49 years. Most cases (97%) were invasive ductal carcinomas not otherwise specified, high grade (41.9%), and unassociated with ductal carcinoma in situ (52.3%). Triple-negative tumors were the commonest immunohistochemical type seen (42.1%), and these were less likely to have an intraductal component (p = 0.0048). Luminal-type tumours were more likely to be low grade (p = 0.0005). The majority of cases presented in advanced stages with no statistically significant difference among the different immunohistochemical subtypes (p = 0.7949). The significant epidemiological and biological differences between breast cancer in Lagos and in western populations are important for the establishment of an effective breast cancer screening programme uniquely tailored for the Nigerian population."
29953989," White matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) and subclinical brain infarcts (SBI) are associated with impaired mobility, but less is known about the association of WMHV in specific brain regions. We hypothesized that anterior WMHV would be associated with lower scores on the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), a well-validated mobility scale. The SPPB was measured a median of 5 years after enrollment into the Northern Manhattan MRI sub study. Volumetric distributions for WMHV in 14 brain regions as a proportion of total cranial volume were determined. Multi-variable linear regression was performed to examine the association of SBI and regional log-WMHV with the SPPB score. Among 668 participants with SPPB measurements (mean 74 ± 9 years, 37% male and 70% Hispanic), the mean SPPB score was 8.2 ± 2.9. Total (beta = -0.3 per SD, p = 0.001), anterior periventricular (beta = -0.4 per SD, p = 0.001), parietal (beta = -0.2 per SD, p = 0.02) and frontal (beta = -0.3 per SD, p = 0.002) WMHVs were associated with SPPB; other WMHV and SBI were not associated with the SPPB. WMHV, especially in the anterior -cerebral regions, is associated with a lower SPPB. Prevention of subclinical cerebrovascular disease is a potential target to prevent physical decline in the elderly."
29953988," In the present study, we investigated whether schisantherin A (StA) had anti-inflammatory effects under neuroinflammatory conditions. The effects of StA and its underlying mechanisms were examined in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated BV-2 microglial cells by ELISA, qPCR, EMSA, Western blot, and IHC. Firstly, we found that StA inhibited the inflammatory response in LPS-activated BV-2 microglia. Secondly, we found that StA suppressed LPS-induced activation of NF-κB via interfering with degradation of IκB and phosphorylation of IκB, IKK, PI3K/Akt, JNK, and p38 MAPK. Thirdly, StA conferred indirect antioxidative effects via quenching ROS and promoted expression of antioxidant enzymes, including HO-1 and NQO-1, via stimulating activation of Nrf2 pathways. Finally, we demonstrated that anti-neuroinflammatory actions of StA were dependent on ERK phosphorylation-mediated Nrf2 activation. StA induced ERK phosphorylation-mediated Nrf2 activation, which contributed to its anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation. The anti-neuroinflammatory and anti-oxidative effects of StA may show preventive therapeutic potential for various neuroinflammatory disorders."
29953987," Etoposide (VP16) is a topoisomerase II inhibitor and has been used for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C (XPC) protein is a DNA damage recognition factor in nucleotide excision repair and involved in regulating NSCLC cell proliferation and viability. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a ubiquitous molecular chaperone that is responsible for the stabilization and maturation of many oncogenic proteins. In this study, we report whether Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) enhanced etoposide-induced cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells through modulating the XPC expression. We found that etoposide increased XPC expression in an AKT activation manner in 2 squamous cell carcinoma H1703 and H520 cells. Knockdown of XPC using siRNA or inactivation of AKT by pharmacological inhibitor PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) enhanced the cytotoxic effects of etoposide. In contrast, enforced expression of XPC cDNA or AKT-CA (a constitutively active form of AKT) reduced the cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition of etoposide. Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG enhanced cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition of etoposide in NSCLC cells, which were associated with the downregulation of XPC expression and inactivation of AKT. Our findings suggested that the Hsp90 inhibition induced XPC downregulation involved in enhancing the etoposide-induced cytotoxicity in H1703 and H520 cells."
29953986," Although appropriate sedation is recommended during flexible bronchoscopy (FB), patients are at risk for hypoventilation due to inadvertent oversedation. End-tidal capnography is expected as an additional useful monitor for these patients during FB. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefit of additional end-tidal capnography monitoring in reducing the incidence of hypoxemia during FB in patients under sedation. Patients undergoing FB under moderate sedation without tracheal intubation were randomly assigned to receive standard monitoring including pulse oximetry or additional capnography monitoring. Bronchoscopy examiners for the only capnography group were informed of apnea events by alarms and display of the capnography monitor. A total of 185 patients were enrolled. Patient characteristics were well balanced between the two groups. Hypoxemia (at least one episode of pulse oximeter oxygen saturation [SpO2] < 90%) was observed in 27 out of 94 patients in the capnography group (29%) and in 42 out of 91 patients in the control group (46%; p = 0.014), resulting in an absolute risk difference of -17.4% (95% confidence interval, -31.1 to -3.7). In the capnography group, hypoxemia duration was shorter (20.4 vs. 41.7 s, p = 0.029), severe hypoxemic events (SpO2 < 85%) were observed less frequently (16 [17%] vs. 29 [32%], p = 0.019), and the mean lowest SpO2 value was higher (90.5 vs. 87.6%, p = 0.002). End-tidal capnography monitoring can reduce the incidence and duration of hypoxemia during FB in nonintubated patients under sedation."
29953985," We present tocilizumab desensitization of a 47-year-old woman affected by rheumatoid arthritis with full body delayed erythematous urticarial reaction. Skin test for tocilizumab gave cutaneous reaction after 6 h at 20 mg/mL. The schedule of desensitization was then adapted for non-immediate reaction. We prepared a desensitization procedure reaching the cumulative dose of 516 mg in 5 weeks. After 6 months, the repetition of skin tests had a negative result, with demonstration of tolerance induction. Today the patient has good control of the disease."
29953984," Since their discovery, glucocorticoids (GCs) have been extensively used for the treatment of ocular diseases because of their anti-inflammatory, anti-edematous and angiostatic properties. Various GCs have been synthetized to optimize their beneficial anti-inflammatory effects and reduce their effects on sodium retention, identified as a mineralocorticoid effect, leading to a potency and specificity grading of the different GCs. However, the side effects, specificity and potency of GCs are highly tissue specific. Because the eye is a confined organ, local GC administration can reduce the systemic undesirable and severe side effects but does not protect from potential local toxicity and side effects, which are dose-dependent, influenced by the disease stage and by genetic and epigenetic susceptibility. GCs can potentially induce retinal cell death through non-classical pathways such as paraptosis and non-caspase-dependent apoptosis that could be undetectable when using classical toxicology tests. To reduce the risks of toxicity, therapeutic lower doses of GCs are desirable and can be achieved using optimized methods of administration such as transscleral iontophoresis or polymeric implants. In the retina, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) expression is regulated by disease conditions such as ocular inflammation. Activation of the MR pathway by its specific ligand, aldosterone, or by illicit GC occupation can cause retinal edema, subretinal fluid accumulation, and choroidal vasodilation and leakage, suggesting that central serous chorioretinopathy could benefit from MR antagonist. A better understanding of the MR/GR balance in the ocular tissue and the differential effects of their activation in the different ocular cells is still required to envisage an optimized use of GCs for the treatment of different ocular disease conditions."
29953983, The study was designed to identify putative Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) receptor/s on C6/36 cells that facilitate viral entry. The virus overlay protein binding assay (VOPBA) was adopted to identify CHIKV-interacting bands present in C6/36 cell membrane and identity of the protein was established by mass spectrometry. The role of this protein as a putative CHIKV receptor on C6/36 cells was confirmed by infection inhibition assay. Cell surface localization of the identified protein was studied by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on nonpermeabilized cells and by flow cytometry. Interaction between this protein and CHIKV was confirmed by co-immunoprecipation (Co-IP) and Western blotting. The effect of depletion of the identified protein by quercetin was demonstrated by infection inhibition assay. A 70-kDa protein was identified as a CHIKV-interacting protein by VOPBA. MALDI-TOF analysis followed by homology search revealed that this protein could be heat shock cognate 70 (HSC 70). Anti-HSC 70 antibodies blocked CHIKV entry into C6/36 cells in a dose-dependent manner. IFA and flow cytometry analysis demonstrated HSC 70 localization on C6/36 cell surface. Co-IP experiments confirmed the interaction between HSC 70 and CHIKV envelope. Quercetin- and YM-01-treated C6/36 cells exhibited dose-dependent infection inhibition. HSC 70 serves as a putative CHIKV receptor on C6/36 cells.
29953982," Acute spontaneous bullous urticaria is an extremely rare entity, and there are few reports with blister formation in acute urticaria patients. We present a two-year old girl who was admitted for bullous spontaneous acute urticaria; the underlying reason for this was not detected. Nikolsky's sign and Darrier's sign were negative. Lesions were not compatible with erythema multiforme. However, biopsy was not allowed to be performed. Because of this, the underlying pathogenesis could not be clarified. She was recovered by a short course of antihistamine and systemic steroid, and the lesions did not recur during two-year follow-up. Short term systemic steroid in addition to oral antihistamines resulted in prompt recovery in a patient with acute urticaria complicated by bullae."
29953981," Caffeine can exacerbate tremor. Reducing caffeine intake or switching to decaffeinated beverages can lessen tremor. Unaffected relatives of essential tremor (ET) cases often have mild, subclinical tremor. One question is whether the coffee and tea consumption pattern in these individuals differs from that of controls (Co). We ascertained the patterns of coffee and tea intake using a structured questionnaire, and compared the use in unaffected first-degree relatives of ET cases (FD-ET) to the use in age-matched Co. Three measures of relative caffeinated coffee + tea to decaffeinated coffee + tea were constructed. Caffeine index 1 = (cups of caffeinated coffee + tea) - (cups of decaffeinated coffee + tea) consumed on the day of evaluation. Caffeine index 2 = (cups of caffeinated coffee + tea) - (cups of decaffeinated coffee + tea) consumed in a typical month. The percentage of coffee and tea that was caffeinated in a typical month was also calculated. There were 263 individuals (190 FD-ET, 73 Co). Caffeine index 1 in FD-ET was less than 1-half that of Co (p = 0.001). Caffeine index 2 was similarly lower in FD-ET than Co (p = 0.027). The percentage of coffee and tea that was caffeinated in a typical month was also significantly lower in FD-ET than Co (p = 0.018). The balance of caffeinated to decaffeinated beverages is different in FD-ET than Co. These data raise several intriguing questions. Among these is whether relatives of ET cases modify their caffeine consumption before disease onset."
29953980," The development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex process which involves deregulation of multiple signalling pathways. The hyper-activation of Wnt signalling promotes sustained expansion, invasion, and neovascularization of HCC. Mangiferin, a natural small molecule present in Mangifera indica L. has been shown to inactivate β-catenin, which is an indispensable regulator in Wnt pathway. Our study aimed to determine whether mangiferin has any inhibitory effect on HCC and examine how it modulates Wnt signalling. The tumour inhibitory effect of mangiferin was examined by in vitro cellular models and an in vivo orthotopic HCC implantation model. The genes responsible for mangiferin-mediated anti-HCC were delineated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) microarray. The expression of target genes was further determined by quantitative PCR and immuno-blotting assays. The binding capacity of Wilms' tumour 1 (WT1) to the lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR. Oral administration of mangiferin inhibited orthotopic tumour growth. Cellular investigations confirmed the dose-dependent inhibition of mangiferin on HCC expansion and invasion. PCR array combined with Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the Wnt pathway was the predominant target of mangiferin and LEF1 was the most reduced gene in the Wnt pathway. Overexpression of LEF1 diminished repression of Wnt signalling and reduced proliferation activity in mangiferin-treated HCC cells. The mangiferin-mediated down-regulation of LEF1 was independent of β-catenin but associated with WT1 protein. WT1 knock-in in HCC cells further enhanced LEF1 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the mangiferin induced repression of LEF1 was associated with decreased occupancy of WT1 on the LEF1 promoter. Our study identifies a novel mechanism of hepatocellular carcinoma inhibition through β-catenin-independent Wnt signalling, which is regulated by WT1-associated LEF1 repression. The study also highlights mangiferin as a promising Wnt inhibitor for HCC treatment."
29953979," The aim of this study was to investigate the association of gait speed and gait variability, an index of how much gait parameters, such as step time, fluctuate step-to-step, with risk of cognitive decline in cognitively normal elderly individuals. While high gait variability is emerging as an early indicator of dementing illnesses, there is little research on whether high gait variability predicts cognitive decline in cognitively normal elderly who have no evidence of cognitive impairment. In this 4-year prospective cohort study on 91 community-dwelling cognitively normal elderly individuals without cerebral ischemic burden or Parkinsonism, we evaluated gait speed and step time variability using a tri-axial accelerometer placed on the center of body mass, and diagnosed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) according to the International Working Group on MCI. We performed Kaplan-Meier analysis with consecutive log-rank testing for MCI-free survival by cohort-specific tertiles of gait speed; hazard ratios (HR) of incident MCI were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, education level, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale score, GDS score, and presence of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele. Out of the 91 participants in the baseline assessment, 87 completed one or more 2-year follow-up assessments, and the median duration of follow-up was 47.1 months. Kaplan-Meier curves of incident MCI show evident differences in risk by gait variability group (χ2 = 9.64, p = 0.002, log-rank test). Mean MCI-free survival in the high variability group was 12% shorter than in the mid-to-low tertile group (47.4 ± 1.74 [SD] vs. 54.04 ± 0.52 months), while it was comparable between gait speed groups (51.59 ± 0.70 vs. 50.64 ± 1.77 months; χ2 = 1.16, p = 0.281). In multivariate analysis, subjects with high gait variability showed about 12-fold higher risk of MCI (HR = 11.97, 95% CI = 1.29-111.37) than those with mid-to-low variability. However, those with slow gait speed showed comparable MCI risk to those with mid-to-high speed (HR = 5.04, 95% CI = 0.53-48.18). Gait variability may be a better predictor of cognitive decline than gait speed in cognitively normal elderly individuals without cerebral ischemic burden or Parkinsonism."
29953978," Previous studies of the laryngectomized vocal tract using formant frequencies reported contradictory findings. Imagining studies of the vocal tract in alaryngeal speakers are limited due to the possible radiation effect as well as the cost and time associated with the studies. The present study examined the vocal tract configuration of laryngectomized individuals using acoustic reflection technology. Thirty alaryngeal and 30 laryngeal male speakers of Cantonese participated in the study. A pharyngometer was used to obtain volumetric information of the vocal tract. All speakers were instructed to imitate the production of /a/ when the length and volume information of the oral cavity, pharyngeal cavity, and the entire vocal tract were obtained. The data of alaryngeal and laryngeal speakers were compared. Pharyngometric measurements revealed no significant difference in the vocal tract dimensions between laryngeal and alaryngeal speakers. Despite the removal of the larynx and a possible alteration in the pharyngeal cavity during total laryngectomy, the vocal tract configuration (length and volume) in laryngectomized individuals was not significantly different from laryngeal speakers. It is suggested that other factors might have affected formant measures in previous studies."
29953977," Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered fundamental in various physiological/pathophysiological processes and prevention/treatment measures such as hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy. In this study, the origination of ROS in human umbilical vein endothelial cells was investigated under basal and HBO conditions. Whole cell or mitochondria-targeted fluorescent probes were applied to mark superoxide anion (O2-), and the ROS produced from mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC), NADPH oxidase (NOX) and xanthine oxidase (XO) were identified by flow cytometry, confocal imaging and microplate fluorometry with or without specific inhibitors. An algorithm was established to calculate ROS proportion of each source. HBO increased ROS to about 2.14-2.44 fold in mitochondria and 1.32-1.42 fold in whole cell. Then ROS levels were significantly decreased by MRC inhibition about 30% and 16%, respectively. NOX or XO inhibition did not affect HBO-induced ROS generation. Based on these data, it could be further estimated that mitochondrial ROS accounted for 32%-39% of basal whole-cell ROS including 3% from MRC complex II, and NOX accounted for at least 24%-29%. Following HBO treatment, almost all increased ROS originated from mitochondria, and MRC complex II contributed at least 45%-60%. This study provided a simple but effective method to estimate the origination of intracellular ROS and found that MRC were the main source of HBO-induced ROS generation."
29953976," We have recently developed an extra-uterine environment for neonatal development (EXTEND) capable of supporting premature fetal lambs and have been able to replicate hypoxic in utero conditions by controlling fetal oxygen delivery. In this study, we investigated the fetal mitochondrial response to hypoxia. Eight premature fetal lambs were delivered via hysterotomy and transitioned to extra-uterine support for 3 weeks. The lambs were divided into 2 groups: normoxic fetuses which maintained physiologic oxygen delivery and hypoxic fetuses in which oxygen delivery was significantly reduced. Control fetuses were delivered via hysterotomy but not cannulated. Measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. There were no significant differences in MMP between normoxic EXTEND fetuses and controls. Hypoxic fetuses had significantly more depolarized mitochondria compared to normoxic fetuses overall, and these changes were specifically appreciated in weeks 1 and 2, but not by week 3. Hypoxic fetuses had significantly elevated levels of HIF-1α compared to normoxic fetuses in the first 2 weeks. Normoxic fetal lambs supported by EXTEND demonstrate normal mitochondrial function as evidenced by equivalent membrane potentials compared to control fetuses. Hypoxic fetuses exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction, though they do show evidence of adaptation after 3 weeks of hypoxic exposure."
29953975," Backgroud/Aims: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a major component of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Several studies focusing on tumor-derived MSCs have demonstrated that they exhibit a strong ability to promote the tumor epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the factors mediating these effects are poorly understood. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry assays were used to detect the expression of Gremlin1 (GREM1) in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues. ShRNA silencing, flow cytometry, cell counting kit (CCK8) assay, invasion assay, western blot were used to detect the effect of GREM1 in ECa109, TE-1 cell lines and xenograft tumor models. In the current study, we found that the GREM1 was overexpressed in human ESCC tissues. The conditioned medium from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs-CM) enhanced the malignancy of xenograft esophageal tumors in vivo, as well as the cell proliferation, viability and invasion of the esophageal carcinoma cell lines ECa109 and TE-1 in vitro. Furthermore, the shRNA silencing of GREM1 in MSCs (shGREM1-MSCs) reversed the increased malignancy of the esophageal tumor in vivo, while the conditioned medium from shGREM1-MSCs (shGREM1-MSCs-CM) affected the cell cycle and cell invasion in vitro. These processes were accompanied by the EMT in the ECa109 and TE-1 cell lines with an alteration in the expression levels of mesenchymal and epithelial markers. Furthermore, the TGF-β/BMP (transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein) signaling pathway participated in the shGREM1-MSCs-CM-induced anti-tumor effect on enhanced esophageal malignancy induced by MSCs-CM treatment. Taken together, our study suggested that GREM1 delivered by MSCs promoted EMT in ESCC in vitro and in vivo, which is partly through TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway. The results provide experimental evidence to a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of esophageal cancer."
29953974," This population-based cohort study investigates the association between osteoarthritis (OA) and dementia as well as the connection between NSAIDs and dementia. We chose the samples from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database and then divided them into two groups, which were then matched 1: 1 by propensity score. The first group was the OA group that contained patients with newly diagnosed OA and the second group was the non-OA group. We used the χ2 test, Student t test, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazard model for different purposes. The prevalence of dementia in the OA group was higher than that in the non-OA group. The adjusted hazard ratio of the former was 1.42 (95% CI, 1.30-1.54). We also found that etoricoxib and diclofenac might reduce the incidence of dementia. Patients with OA might have a higher risk of dementia. Both etoricoxib and diclofenac might lower the risk of dementia in patients with OA."
29953973," It is known that early-deafened cochlear implant (CI) users are a very heterogeneously performing group. To gain more insight into this population, this study investigated (1) postoperative changes in auditory performance over time based on various outcome measures, focusing on poor performers, (2) self-perceived outcomes, (3) relations between auditory and self-perceived outcomes, and (4) preimplantation factors predicting postoperative outcomes. Outcomes were assessed prospectively in a group of 27 early-deafened, late-implanted CI users, up to 3 years after implantation. Outcome measures included open-set word and sentence recognition, closed-set word recognition, speech tracking and a questionnaire on self-perceived outcomes. Additionally, the relative influence of 8 preimplantation factors on CI outcome was assessed with linear regression analyses. Significant improvements were found for auditory performance measures and most of the questionnaire domains. Significant changes of the closed-set word test, speech tracking and questionnaire were also found for a subgroup of poor performers. Correlations between auditory and self-perceived outcomes were weak and nonsignificant. Preoperative word recognition and preoperative hearing thresholds, both for the implanted ear, were significant predictors of postoperative outcome in the multivariable regression model, explaining 63.5% of the variation. Outcome measurement in this population should be adjusted to the patients' individual performance level and include self-perceived benefit. There is still a need for more knowledge regarding predictors of CI outcomes in this group, but the current study suggests the importance of the preoperative performance of the ear to be implanted."
29953972," Somatotropinomas are rare in childhood and frequently associated with genetic mutations. AIP mutations are found in 20-25% cases and cause aggressive somatotropinomas, often resistant to somatostatin analogues. To assess responses to multimodal therapy including pegvisomant in 2 children with sporadic somatotropinomas due to AIP mutations. We report 2 children, a boy aged 13 and a girl aged 10, with rapid growth, visual impairment, and growth hormone hypersecretion. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a pituitary macroadenoma with parasellar extension in both. Despite multiple surgical attempts to debulk tumour mass, residual tumour persisted. Genetic analysis showed two different AIP mutations (patient 1: c.562delC [p.Arg188Glyfs*8]; patient 2: c.140_ 163del24 [p.Gly47_Arg54del8]). They were initially treated with a long-acting somatostatin analogue (octreotide LAR 30 mg/month) and cabergoline as a dopamine agonist, with the later addition of pegvisomant titrated up to 20 mg/day and with radiotherapy for long-term control. Somatostatin analogue was ceased due to patient intolerance and lack of control. Patient 1 had normalization of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) after 5 months of combined therapy with pegvisomant and cabergoline. For patient 2, normalization of IGF-1 was achieved after 2 months of cabergoline and pegvisomant. AIP-associated tumours can be resistant to management with somatostatin analogues. Pegvisomant can safely be used, to normalize IGF-1 levels and help control disease."
29953971," Identifying comorbidities that influence preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) can give some insight into the AD early stages trajectories to allow new treatment venues and to guide public health systems to prevent subsequent dementia. To examine the association of multimorbidity with AD neuroimaging markers in cognitively normal older adults. This study had a cross-sectional design. Data regarding 14 comorbidities were obtained for all 318 adults aged 70-85 years, recruited from the community to an ongoing prospective monocentric cohort. They underwent standardized neuropsychological and neuroimaging assessment with automated methods that measured hippocampal volumes, white matter hyperintensity volumes, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) standardized uptake values (SUV) in AD signature regions, and amyloid positron emission tomography (amyloid-PET) SUV ratios. Linear regression was used to assess the association of multimorbidity with AD neuroimaging biomarkers. Multimorbidity is signif icantly associated with lower hippocampal volumes (-0.03 ± 0.01; p = 0.012; R2 = 0.017) and lower FDG-PET SUV (-0.027 ± 0.009; p = 0.005; R2 = 0.022), with no association with amyloid deposition (0.001 ± 0.007; p = 0.884; R2 = 0.0001). Taken individually, obesity and excessive alcohol use are associated with lower FDG-PET values, whereas obstructive sleep apnea and mood disorders are related to lower amyloid-PET SUV ratios. Multimorbidity is associated with preclinical AD imaging markers of neurodegeneration, but not with amyloid."
29953970," Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal malignant tumors with poor prognosis. Conventional chemotherapies including gemcitabine have failed owing to weak response and side effects. Hence novel treatment regimens are urgently needed to improve the therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we aimed to assess the anticancer activity of melatonin and sorafenib as a novel therapy against PDAC. We used various apoptosis assay and PDAC xenograft model to assess anticancer effect in vitro and in vivo. We applied phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) array and phospho-tyrosine kinase array to explore the mechanism of the combined therapy. Western blotting, proximity ligation assay, and immunoprecipitation assay were also performed for validation. Melatonin synergized with sorafenib to suppress the growth of PDAC both in vitro and in vivo. The effect was due to increased apoptosis rate of PDAC cells that was accompanied by mitochondria dysfunction. The enhanced anticancer efficacy by the co-treatment could be explained by blockade of PDGFR-β/STAT3 signaling pathway and melatonin receptor (MT)-mediated STAT3. Melatonin reinforces the anticancer activity of sorafenib by downregulation of PDGFR-β/STAT3 signaling pathway and melatonin receptor (MT)-mediated STAT3. The combination of the two agents might be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating PDAC."
29953969," In the treatment of serious and symptomatic coronary heart disease (CHD), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a frequently utilized intervention. In addition, the risk of CHD is strongly associated with the low activity of paraoxonase-1 (PON1), whose 3'-UTR harbors an rs3735590 polymorphism. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the rs3735590 polymorphism could be used as a prognosis marker in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients undergoing CABG. In addition, the hypothesis, i.e., the rs3735590 polymorphism may be involved in the regulation of PON1 gene expression via modulating its interaction with miRNAs, was tested in this study. 292 patients diagnosed with COPD and treated with CABG were recruited for this study. Genomic DNA was extracted from clinical samples, and real-time quantitative PCR and Western-blot were used to measure the expression of miR-616 and PON1 in liver cells of different genotypes. 292 COPD patients were divided into three groups according to their genotypes, i.e., rs3735590: CC (212), TC (75), and TT (5), respectively (TC and TT were merged in one group of T carriers for statistical analyses). Patients with the CC genotype were associated with a shorter event-free survival time as compared to patients with the T genotypes. In addition, PON1 was confirmed as a direct target gene of miR-616, while experiments with primary cells of different genotypes showed that miR-616 inhibited the expression of PON1 in CC cells. On the contrary, rs3735590 impaired such inhibitory effect of miR-616 in TT cells. The rs3735590 polymorphism of PON1 acts as a prognostic biomarker in COPD patients treated by CABG."
29953967," To investigate whether statin intervention will improve the long-term prognosis of patients undergoing major non-cardiac vascular surgeries. Major database searches for clinical trials enrolling patients undergoing major non-cardiac vascular surgeries, including lower limb revascularization, carotid artery surgeries, arteriovenous fistula, and aortic surgeries, were performed. Subgroup analyses, stratified by surgical types or study types, were employed to obtain statistical results regarding survival, patency rates, amputation, and cardiovascular and stroke events. Odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by Review Manager 5.3. Sensitivity analysis, publication bias and meta-regression were conducted by Stata 14.0. In total, 34 observational studies, 8 prospective cohort studies and 4 randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) were enrolled in the present analysis. It was demonstrated that statin usage improved all-cause mortality in lower limb, carotid, aortic and mixed types of vascular surgery subgroups compared with those in which statins were not used. Additionally, the employment of statins efficiently enhanced the primary and secondary patency rates and significantly decreased the amputation rates in the lower limb revascularization subgroup. Furthermore, for other complications, statin intervention decreased cardiovascular events in mixed types of vascular surgeries and stroke incidence in the carotid surgery subgroup. No significant publication bias was observed. The meta-regression results showed that the morbidity of cardiovascular disease or the use of aspirin might affect the overall estimates in several subgroups. This meta-analysis demonstrated that statin therapy was associated with improved survival rates and patency rates and with reduced cardiovascular or stroke morbidities in patients who underwent non-cardiac vascular surgeries."
29953966," The plant hormone auxin is a key player in the regulation of plant growth and development. Despite numerous studies devoted to understanding its role in a wide spectrum of physiological processes, full appreciation of its function is linked to a comprehensive determination of its spatio-temporal distribution, which plays a crucial role in its mode of action. Conjugation of fluorescent tracers to plant hormones enables sensitive and specific visualization of their subcellular and tissue-specific localization and transport in planta, which represents a powerful tool for plant physiology. However, to date, only a few fluorescently labeled auxins have been developed. We report the synthesis of four novel fluorescently labeled derivatives of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in the form of a conjugate with a nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) fluorophore together with validation of their biological activity. These compounds, unlike other previously reported auxins fluorescently labeled at N1 position (nitrogen of the indole ring), do not possess auxin activity but rather show dose-dependent inhibition of auxin-induced effects, such as primary root growth inhibition, root hair growth and the auxin reporter DR5::GUS expression. Moreover, the study demonstrates the importance of the character of the linker and optimal choice of the labeling site in the preparation of fluorescently labeled auxins as important variables influencing their biological activity and fluorescent properties."
29953965," MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a novel class of important gene-regulatory molecules, correlates with tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and chemo resistance in gastric cancer (GC). Microarray analysis revealed that aberrant expressed microRNA-17 (miR-17) and DEDD were identified in GC. DEDD has been found to act as an endogenous suppressor of tumor growth and metastasis through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. However, the role of miRNA-17 (miR-17) has not been clearly evaluated in GC, thereby a series of in vitro experiments were performed in this study. The levels of miR-17 and DEDD in GC tissues from patients diagnosed with GC and in five GC cell lines (SGC-7901, MKN-45, HGC-27, BGC823, and AGS) were detected. It was found that miR-17 up-regulated and DEDD down-regulated in GC, and SGC-7901 and AGS cells were adopted for the in vitro cell experiments, in which the expression of miR-17 or DEDD was regulated by transfection. DEDD was validated to be a target gene of miR-17. Inhibition of miR-17 impaired EMT in GC cells. In addition, transwell assay and scratch test results revealed that inhibition of miR-17 hindered GC cell invasion and migration. Moreover, inhibition of miR-17 reduced resistance to cisplatin- or 5-Fu in GC cells and induced cisplatin- or 5-Fu-treated GC cell apoptosis, which evaluated by using CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays. From the short review above, the key findings emerge that inhibition of miR-17 may have tumor suppressive effects on GC and enhance its chemosensitivity by promoting DEDD, highlighting a novel target for GC therapy."
29953964," There is significant debate within the diagnostics community regarding the accuracy of variant identification by next-generation sequencing and the necessity of confirmatory testing of detected variants. Since the quality threshold to discriminate false-positives depends on the nature of the workflow, no regulatory standard regarding this matter has yet been published. The goal of this study was to empirically determine the threshold to perform additional Sanger sequencing and to reduce the experimental cost to a practical level. Using 278 model genes, a hybridization capture-based protocol was examined to meet the clinical requirements of low cost, high efficiency, and high data quality. To reduce excessive false-positive detection, filtering processes were introduced to remove mis-mapped reads and strand-biased detection to a published best-practices pipeline. With seven samples from the 1000 Genome Project, 2,750 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 142 insertion/deletions were identified by our designed workflow. Compared to variants registered in the dbSNP, a zero false-positive threshold value was determined (QUAL > 1,000). The variants satisfying these criteria accounted for 95.6% of single nucleotide polymorphisms and 50.7% of insertion/deletions. Except for deletions located within the highly repeated sequences, the workflow achieved 100% sensitivity. The established threshold allowed us to discriminate between convincing variants and those requiring validation, a design that reconciles the competing objectives of cost minimization and quality maximization of clinical gene panel testing."
29953963," Over the past 20 years, mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a dynamic tool for proteomics biomarker discovery. However, published MS biomarker candidates often do not translate to the clinic, failing during attempts at independent replication. The cause can be shortcomings in study design, sample quality, assay quantitation, and/or quality/process control. To address these shortcomings, we developed an MS workflow in accordance with Tier 2 measurement requirements for targeted peptides, defined by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) ""fit-for-purpose"" approach, using dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM) which measures specific peptide transitions during predefined retention time (RT) windows. We describe the development of a robust multipex dMRM assay measuring 641 proteotypic peptides from 392 colorectal cancer (CRC) related proteins, and the procedures to track and handle sample processing and instrument variation over a four-month study, during which the assay measured blood samples from 1045 patients with CRC symptoms. After data collection, transitions were filtered by signal quality metrics before entering receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The results demonstrated CRC signal carried by 127 proteins in the symptomatic population. The workflow might be further developed to build Tier 1 assays for clinical tests identifying symptomatic individuals at elevated risk of CRC. We developed a dMRM MS method with the rigor of a Tier 2 assay as defined by the CPTAC 'fit for purpose approach' [1]. Using quality and process control procedures, the assay was used to quantify 641 proteotypic peptides representing 392 CRC-related proteins in plasma from 1045 CRC-symptomatic patients. To our knowledge, this is the largest MRM method applied to the largest study to date. The results showed that 127 of the proteins carried univariate CRC signal in the symptomatic population. This large number of single biomarkers bodes well for future development of multivariate classifiers to distinguish CRC in the symptomatic population."
29953962," Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide. Biomarkers that can facilitate better clinical management of CRC are in high demand to improve patient outcome and to reduce mortality. In this regard, proteomic analysis holds a promising prospect in the hunt of novel biomarkers for CRC and in understanding the mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis. This review aims to provide an overview of the current progress of proteomic research, focusing on discovery and validation of diagnostic biomarkers for CRC. We will summarize the contributions of proteomic strategies to recent discoveries of protein biomarkers for CRC and also briefly discuss the potential and challenges of different proteomic approaches in biomarker discovery and translational applications."
29953961," Physical exercise has been reported to increase neurotrophin in brain tissues as hippocampus as well as increased neurotrophic level peripherally in blood plasma and might have an effect on/or affect molecular processes of energy metabolism (and homeostasis). In this study, using quantitative proteomic analysis, we obtained a plasma protein profile from the rat with long-term moderate exercise. A total of 752 proteins were identified in the plasma. Among them, 54 proteins were significant up-regulated and 47 proteins were down-regulated in the plasma of exercise group compared with the control group. Bioinformatic analyses showed that these altered proteins are widely involved in multiple biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components, which connect with 11 signaling pathways. Interestingly, 5 up-regulated proteins Rap1b, PTPN11, ARHGDIA, Cdc42 and YWHAE, confirmed by Western blots, are involved in the neurotrophin signaling pathway which shows the lowest P value among the identified pathways. Further analyses showed that the 5 neurotrophin-signaling-pathway-related proteins participate in two important protein-protein interaction networks associated to cell survival and apoptosis, axonal development, synapse formation and plasticity. This study provides an exercise-induced plasma protein profile, suggesting that long-term exercise enhances the proteins involved in neurotrophin signaling pathway which may contribute to health benefit. Physical activity contributes to myriad benefits on body health across the lifespan. The changes in plasma proteins after chronic moderate exercise may be used as biomarkers for health and may also play important roles in increase of cardiovascular fitness, enhancement of immune competence, prevention of obesity, decrease of risk for neurological disorders, cancer, stroke, diabetes and other metabolic disorders. Using a TMT-based proteomic method, this study identified 101 altered proteins in the plasma of rats after long-term moderate treadmill running, which may provide novel biomarkers for further investigation of the underlying mechanism of physical exercise. We confirmed that exercise enhances 5 proteins of the neurotrophin signaling pathway that may contribute to health benefits."
29953960," Deposition of calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals in renal interstitium is one of the key factors that cause progressive inflammation in kidney stone disease. Macrophages are responsible for elimination of these crystals but their roles to worsen inflammatory process remain under-investigated. This study thus aimed to define roles of exosomes released from macrophages exposed to CaOx crystals in mediating subsequent inflammatory cascades. Macrophages were incubated with or without CaOx monohydrate (COM) crystals for 16 h and their exosomes were isolated. Quantitative proteomics using nanoLC-ESI-Qq-TOF MS/MS revealed 26 proteins with significantly altered levels in exosomes derived from COM-treated macrophages (COM-treated exosomes) comparing to those derived from the controlled macrophages (controlled exosomes). Protein network analysis showed that these altered proteins were involved in cytoskeleton and actin binding, calcium binding, stress response, transcription regulation, immune response and extracellular matrix disassembly. Functional investigations revealed that COM-treated exosomes enhanced IL-8 production from renal tubular cells, activated neutrophil migration, had increased (exosomal) membrane fragility, had greater binding capacity to COM crystals, and subsequently enhanced crystal invasion through extracellular matrix migration chamber. These data indicate that macrophage exosomes play important roles in inflammatory response to COM crystals and may be involved in crystal invasion in the renal interstitium."
29953959," The aim of this work was to assess the effects of manganese (Mn) toxicity on the proteome of tomato roots using two proteomic approaches, shotgun and two-dimensional electrophoresis. The shotgun approach yielded 367 reliable proteins, whereas the 2-DE approach detected 340 consistent spots. The 2-DE method found 54 proteins changing in relative abundance in the excess Mn treatment, whereas the shotgun detected changes in 118 proteins. Only 7% of the differential proteins were found by both methods, illustrating their complementary nature. Metabolic pathways most affected were protein metabolism, oxido-reductases and signaling. Results support that Mn toxicity alters the protein turnover and impairs energy production in roots, leading to changes in glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, TCA and oxidative phosphorylation. Excess Mn also induced changes in peroxidases and hydrolases participating in cell wall lignification and suberization and activated plant defense mechanisms, with changes occurring via pathogenesis-related proteins as well as peroxidases. Finally, Mn toxicity elicited regulatory mechanisms and affected the abundance of root nutrient reservoir proteins. The overall analysis of the differential root proteome upon Mn toxicity suggests a general slowdown of metabolic activities especially energy production, cell wall integrity and protein turnover which occurs in parallel with increases in stress related proteins."
29953958," Amyloidosis is a group of diseases characterized by an irreversible and extracellular deposition of fibrillar, amorphous protein known as amyloid in different organs and tissues. Amyloid deposits may occur locally in tissues or may involve various organs, resulting in a wide range of clinical manifestations. Amyloidosis of the head and neck is rarely seen and can reflect some plasma cell dyscrasia that affects B lymphocytes. Deposition of amyloid on the tongue is very rare and accounts for less than 9% of all types of amyloidosis. Amyloid involvement of the tongue is almost always secondary to systemic amyloidosis. We report a 73-year-old female who presented with weight loss and macroglossia. Firstly, she was diagnosed only with amyloidosis of the tongue. Her general health condition was evaluated, revealing renal dysfunction, anemia, hypercalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia. The final diagnosis was systemic amyloidosis with multiple myeloma. The patient was referred for emergency hemodialysis and chemotherapy. Her condition progressed to congestive heart failure and recurrent urinary and respiratory infections. After 100 days from diagnosis, the patient died by pulmonary infection as a consequence of her weakened state of health. It is important to highlight role of the dentist especially oral pathologist to the evaluation of local alterations that may reflect systemic deterioration of patients."
29953957," Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are an important source of innovative medicines. Compared with their larger counterparts, they experience challenges as a result of insufficient human and financial resources that can hamper drug development and regulatory compliance. This analysis reviews the profile of major objections raised in applications for medicines for human use submitted by SMEs to the European Medicines Agency between 2011 and 2015 and their impact on the outcome of applications. It showed that SMEs experience challenges in the quality (e.g., manufacturing process validation and on control and/or characterisation data of drug substance or drug product) and the clinical sections of marketing authorisation applications (e.g., analysis or robustness of pivotal data or selection of submitted studies, study design issues and marginal or no clinical relevant efficacy), with deficiencies in demonstrating clinical efficacy representing the major eventual hurdles to authorisation."
29953955," The electrophysiological features and roles of persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) in supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) are not known. To elucidate the electrophysiological features and roles of PLSVC in patients with SVT. We included 37 patients (age: 43.5 ± 17.1 years; men: 35.1%) with PLSVC and 510 patients (age: 43.9 ± 18.8 years; men: 48.2%) without PLSVC who underwent an electrophysiological study for SVT. The number of induced tachycardias, location of the slow pathway (SP) or accessory pathway (AP), and radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) outcomes were compared between patients with and without PLSVC. During RFCA of the left AP, a coronary sinus (CS) catheter was placed into the left superior vena cava (LSVC group) or the great cardiac vein (GCV group). The RFCA outcomes were compared between the groups. In the patients with PLSVC, 40 tachycardias were induced: atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) (n = 19), atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (n = 17), and focal atrial tachycardia (n = 4). Among patients with AVNRT, an SP in the CS was significantly more frequent in patients with PLSVC than in those without PLSVC (47.4% versus 3.8%, P < .001). In patients with the left AP, the number of RFCA attempts and recurrence were lower in the GCV group than in the LSVC group. An SP in the CS is prevalent in patients with AVNRT and PLSVC. It is useful to place a CS catheter into the great cardiac vein in patients with a left AP and PLSVC."
29953954," Various risk stratifications in asymptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) have been proposed, but the electrophysiological change that promotes ventricular fibrillation (VF) is still unknown. The aim of this study was to clarify the changes of ECG at the onset of VF compared to ECGs recorded when patients were still asymptomatic. The subjects were composed of 14 patients with VF and 48 consecutive asymptomatic patients with BrS. We compared ECGs before the initial VF (>6 months, early phase) with ECGs at the initial VF episode (late phase). In asymptomatic patients, we evaluated ECGs at two time points with an interval of more than 6 months. We evaluated various ECG markers including type 1 ECG, fragmented QRS (fQRS, multiple spikes within the QRS complex). ECG parameters of the early and late phases were not different except for decreased ST level and low incidence of type 1 ECG in asymptomatic patients. There were no differences in ECG parameters of the early phase between VF and asymptomatic patients. In VF patients, ECG at the late phase had longer QRS and Tpeak-Tend (Tpe) intervals and more frequent type 1 ECG and fQRS than did ECG at the early phase. Those changes were associated with initial VF events (odds ratio [OR]: QRS widening: 11.5, p<0.01, Tpe: 11.6, p<0.01, fQRS: 15.3, p<0.01, type 1 ECG: 6.6, p<0.05). QRS and ST-T abnormalities developed in association with the initial VF onset. Aggravation of the conduction disturbance in addition to BrS-ECG promotes VF."
29953953," Since the 1950's, hydrocephalus can be treated with cerebrospinal fluid shunts, usually to the peritoneal cavity or to the right cardiac atrium. However, due to their siphoning effect, these shunts lead to non-physiological cerebrospinal fluid drainage, with possible co-morbidity and high revision rates. More sophisticated shunt valve systems significantly increase costs and technical complexity and remain unsuccessful in a subgroup of patients. In an attempt to obtain physiological cerebrospinal fluid shunting, many neurosurgical pioneers shunted towards the dural sinuses, taking advantage of the physiological anti-siphoning effect of the internal jugular veins. Despite several promising reports, the ventriculosinus shunts did not yet become standard neurosurgical practice. In this mono-centric prospective clinical study, we implanted the retrograde ventriculosinus shunt, as advocated by El-Shafei, in 10 patients. This article reports on our operation technique and long-term outcome, including 4 patients in whom this shunt was implanted as a rescue. Implantation of a ventriculosinus shunt proved to be a feasible technique, warranting physiological drainage of cerebrospinal fluid. However, only in 3 out of 14 patients, functionality of the retrograde ventriculosinus shunt was maintained during more than 6 years follow-up. In our opinion, these shunts fail because present venous access devices are difficult to implant correctly and get too easily obstructed. After discussing possible causes of this frequent obstruction, a new dural venous sinus access device is presented. An easy to implant and thrombogenic-resistant dural venous sinus access device needs to be developed before ventriculosinus shunting can become general practice."
29953952," Emerging evidence indicates that vitamin D has anti-oxidative properties. The present study investigates whether serum 25‑hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is associated with biomarkers of anti-oxidative status in community-dwelling older adults using cross-sectional and longitudinal data. A total of 302 subjects aged 62 to 92 years from Germany (50.6°N) were analysed via cross-sectional approach. For longitudinal analysis, data of 153 subjects were available. Fasting blood samples from 2004 and 2012 were analysed for 25(OH)D concentrations, total anti-oxidative status (TAOS) as well as anti-oxidative enzymes, such as catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Multiple regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between 25(OH)D and parameters of anti-oxidative status. In cross-sectional analyses, 25(OH)D was a significant predictor of CAT (β = -0.166; P = 0.010), lg The maintenance of an adequate vitamin D status may have a beneficial impact on the anti-oxidative defence system in older adults on a long-term perspective."
29953951," Arterial stiffness increases with advancing age, and is as an emerging biomarker in the assessment of vascular health. Some studies suggest that high-intensity resistance training increases arterial stiffness, but low- to moderate-intensity resistance training does not effect on arterial stiffening. Current evidence suggests that performing aerobic exercise after resistance training improved arterial stiffness in the young men and women. However, few studies have been conducted on the effects of the order of combined training on arterial stiffness in the elderly. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of exercise order of combined aerobic and resistance training into the same session on body composition, muscle strength and arterial stiffness in older men. Forty-five older men (aged 70.5 ± 3.5 years) were randomly assigned to 3 groups; AR: aerobic before resistance training, RA: resistance before aerobic training and CON: no training. Subjects trained 2 times per week for 10 weeks. Resistance training consisted of 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions for 5 different exercises, 70-80% of one repetition maximum (1RM). Aerobic exercise consisted of cycling at 60% of heart rate reserve (HRR). Significant interaction effects were observed in waist circumference (P < 0.01), grip strength (P < 0.01), 10-m walk speed (P < 0.05) and 1RM strength (P < 0.01). However, no significant differences were observed between AR and RA. In contrast, pulse wave velocity (PWV) significantly reduced in the RA (9.0 ± 1.6 m/s to 8.0 ± 1.6 m/s, P < 0.05), whereas, it did not change in the AR, and there was a significant group difference (P < 0.05). In conclusion, no effects of the exercise order were observed in body composition, physical fitness and muscle strength. However, aerobic exercise after high-intensity resistance training reduced arterial stiffness and difference of exercise order was observed. We suggest that the exercise order may favorably affect arterial stiffness when combined aerobic exercise and high-intensity resistance training is performed into the same session."
29953950," A growing body of research in elderly populations suggests that the early phase of an explosive muscle contraction (i.e., ≤200 ms) may be more functionally relevant than peak values. However, age-related variation in early phase explosive strength has never been investigated across the full-adult life span. This cross-sectional study investigated the age-related changes in the rate of power development (RPD) and compared it to the changes in peak power (P"
29953949," Wilson's storm-petrels (Oceanites oceanicus) are the smallest marine birds breeding in Antarctica, where events like snowstorms often prevent parents from providing food daily for their offspring. To minimize energy expenses, Wilson's storm-petrel chicks can reduce their metabolism and body temperature by entering hypothermia. Hypothermia is reported to impact development, hence we hypothesized that hypothermia will be majorly used after long fasting periods. Chick development in a breeding colony of Wilson's storm-petrels on the South Shetland Islands was monitored daily during three consecutive summers by recording chicks' body mass and temperature, as well as environmental parameters. Provisioning, and body conditions were highest in 2017, and chicks became hypothermic most frequently in 2016. Body temperature was influenced by age, mass, body condition, and minimal nocturnal temperatures. While most chicks were able to maintain stable body temperatures when not fed for one day, some chicks' body temperatures decreased by up to 21 °C. Age did not differ between those two groups, but chicks maintaining their active body temperatures had higher body conditions. Snowstorms were typically followed by several days of unreliable food provisioning and continuous days of fasting. Most chicks were hypothermic during this time, and were hence able to survive periods of food shortages, reverse their low body temperatures after the next feeding event, and regain body mass. We conclude that hypothermia is a strong survival strategy to endure times of fasting, which might be necessary for Antarctic storm-petrel chicks to reach adulthood. However, in future scenarios, which may include more frequent snowstorms due to climate change, malnourishment could lead to more frequent use of hypothermia, which could affect chicks' development."
29953948," Along with its outstanding antidepressant effect, electroconvulsive shock (ECS) can induce learning and memory impairment. Propofol and ketamine have shown to be useful in alleviating the learning and memory impairment. Nevertheless, the mechanism still remains unclear. This study investigated the role of NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated metaplasticity in the learning and memory impairment induced by ECS, as well as the neuroprotective effect of propofol and ketamine in depressive rats. Rats received ECS or ECS under anesthetics after chronic unpredictable mild stress procedure. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was tested by extracellular recording. LTD/LTP threshold was assessed by stimulation of different frequencies. Additionally, NMDAR-mediated field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) and NMDAR input/output relationship were detected under hippocampal slice perfusion. Results showed that propofol or low-dose ketamine could partially alleviate ECS-induced LTP impairment, while propofol combined with low-dose ketamine almost reversed the LTP impairment. LTP under ECS was increased by stronger stimulation. ECS could up-regulated LTD/LTP threshold, while propofol or ketamine could down-regulate it. Moreover, ECS activated NMDAR, while propofol and ketamine could inhibit the activation of NMDAR. NMDAR input/output relationship decrease was induced by preconditioning (an analog of ECS in hippocampal slice), however, NMDAR input/output relationship increased by propofol or ketamine. In conclusion, ECS-induced cognitive impairment is caused by NMDAR-mediated metaplasticity via up-regulation of LTD/LTP threshold. Propofol or ketamine alleviates the cognitive impairment, possibly by down-regulating the threshold via inhibition of NMDAR activation induced by ECS."
29953947," Online educational materials are largely disseminated through videos, and yet there is little understanding of how these videos engage students and fuel academic success. We hypothesized that components of the electroencephalogram (EEG), previously shown to reflect video engagement, would be predictive of academic performance in the context of educational videos. Two groups of subjects watched educational videos in either an intentional learning paradigm, in which they were aware of an upcoming test, or in an incidental learning paradigm, in which they were unaware that they would be tested. ""Neural engagement"" was quantified by the inter-subject correlation (ISC) of the EEG that was evoked by the videos. In both groups, students with higher neural engagement retained more information. Neural engagement also discriminated between attentive and inattentive video viewing. These results suggest that this EEG metric is a marker of the stimulus-related attentional mechanisms necessary to retain information. In the future, EEG may be used as a tool to design and assess online educational content."
29953946," Factor H binding protein (fHbp) is the most promising vaccine candidate against serogroup B of Neisseria meningitidis which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children. In order to facilitate large scale production of a commercial vaccine, we previously used transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, but plant-derived fHbp is still far away from a commercial vaccine due to less biomass production. Herein, we presented an alternative route for the production of recombinant fHbp from the seeds of transgenic rice. The OsrfHbp gene encoding recombinant fHbp fused protein was introduced into the genome of rice via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The both stable integration and transcription of the foreign OsrfHbp were confirmed by Southern blotting and RT-PCR analysis respectively. Further, the expression of fHbp protein was measured by immunoblotting analysis and quantified by ELISA. The results indicated that fHbp was successfully expressed and the highest yield of fHbp was 0.52 ± 0.03% of TSP in the transgenic rice seeds. The purified fHbp protein showed good antigenicity and immunogenicity in the animal model. The results of this experiment offer a novel approach for large-scale production of plant-derived commercial vaccine fHbp."
29953945," Systemic sclerosis is a progressive inflammatory disease that is frequently fatal and has limited treatment options. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) has been evaluated as treatment for this disease in observational studies, multicenter randomized controlled clinical trials, and meta-analyses. On behalf of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT), a panel of experts in transplantation and rheumatology was convened to review available evidence and make a recommendation on AHCT as an indication for systemic sclerosis. Three randomized trials have compared the efficacy of AHCT with cyclophosphamide only and all demonstrated benefit for the AHCT arm for their primary endpoint (improvement in ASSIST, event-free survival in ASTIS trial and change in global rank composite score in SCOT trial). AHCT recipients also had better overall survival and a lower rate of disease progression. These findings have been confirmed in subsequent meta-analyses. Based on this high-quality evidence, the ASBMT recommends systemic sclerosis be considered as ""standard of care"" indication for AHCT. Close collaboration between rheumatologists and transplant clinicians is critical for optimizing patient selection and patient outcomes. Transplant centers in the United States are strongly encouraged to report patient and outcomes data to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research on their patients receiving AHCT for this indication."
29953943," Serotonin (5-HT), a well-known neurotransmitter in the brain, also plays an important role in peripheral tissues, including the immune system. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that many different types of immune cells express the machinery to generate, store, respond to and/or transport serotonin, including T cells, macrophages, mast cells, dendritic cells and platelets. In addition, there is emerging evidence of a possible connection between T cells, serotonin and mood disorders. How 5-HT interacts with the peripheral immune system and if this signaling is associated with behavioral phenotypes found in mood disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD) is not well understood. In this review, we summarize the existing literature on what is known about the link between 5-HT and the immune system and the effects of 5-HT signaling on different cells of the peripheral immune system, with a particular focus on T cells. In addition, we review the current evidence that peripheral immune system alterations and CNS function may be interrelated and the possible implications of these findings for drug discovery."
29953942," Prenatal drug exposure, including cocaine, alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco, is associated with deficits in behavioral regulation and attention. Using fMRI, the objective of this study was to characterize the association between prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) and the underlying neural substrates associated with behavioral outcomes of attention. Forty-seven young adults were recruited for this study from the ongoing Maternal Health Practices and Child Development (MHPCD) Project, a longitudinal study of the effects of PCE on growth, behavior, and cognitive function. Three groups were compared: 1) prenatal exposure to cocaine, alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco (CAMT, n = 15), 2) prenatal exposure to alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco (AMT, n = 17), and 3) no prenatal exposure to drugs (Controls, n = 15). Subjects were frequency matched on gender, race, handedness, and 15-year IQ. This study used the theoretical model proposed by Posner and Peterson (1990), which posits three dissociable components of attention: alerting, orienting, and executive attention. Subjects completed a functional MRI (fMRI) scan while performing the Attention Network Task, a validated neuroimaging measure of the 3-network model of attention. Behavioral and fMRI data revealed no associations between PCE and task accuracy, speed of processing, or activation in key brain regions associated with each of the attention networks. The results of this study show that any subtle differences in brain function associated with PCE are not detectable using the ANT task and fMRI. These results should be interpreted in the context of other studies that have found associations between PCE and arousal with emotionally arousing stimuli, compared to this study that found no associations using emotionally neutral stimuli."
29953941," The World Health Assembly Palliative Care Resolution in 2014 and the inclusion of palliative care within the Sustainable Development Goals raised optimism that palliative care would no longer be a peripheral aspect of global health. However, no funding, accountability measures or indicators for palliative care development accompanied these policy developments. This risks health actors continuing to prioritise the attainment of better known, target-driven aspects of healthcare. To explore the attitudes of international palliative care experts regarding how the future development of palliative care can be accelerated. Sixteen international palliative care experts were interviewed for their epistemic expertise. Participants were interviewed face to face or via skype. Interviews were recorded, transcribed non-verbatim and analysed using a thematic approach (NVIVO). Participants strongly supported the rollout of national palliative care policies around the world for two reasons: 1) to ensure palliative care attracts national funding streams and 2) to attract global funding for palliative care. The absence of a global indicator for palliative care development was considered a severe impediment to the inclusion of palliative care within global efforts towards Universal Health Care (UHC). Advocacy partnerships, using human rights approaches with economic 'frames', were considered the most effective methods of influencing policymakers. Palliative care represents a value proposition which is not currently being maximised by advocacy. Advocates should consider palliative care developmentally, focussing upon 'key asks' for development and consider how palliative care can contribute to other international development priorities, in particular poverty reduction."
29953940," Few patients with dysphagia due to stroke receive early palliative care to align treatment goals with their values, as called for by practice guidelines, particularly before enteral access procedures for artificial nutrition. To increase documented goals of care (GOC) discussions among acute stroke patients prior to feeding gastrostomy tube placement. We undertook a rapid-cycle continuous quality improvement (CQI) process with interdisciplinary planning, implementation, and performance review to operationalize an upstream trigger for palliative care referral prompted by the speech and language pathology evaluation. Over a 6-month period, 21 patients underwent gastrostomy tube placement; 52% had pre-procedure GOC discussions post-intervention, with the rate of compliance increasing steadily from 13% (11/87, pre-intervention) to 100% (2/2) in the final 2 months. We effectively increased documented GOC discussions prior to feeding gastrostomy tube placement among stroke patients. Systems-based tools and education will enhance this upstream trigger model to ensure early palliative care for stroke patients."
29953938," The analysis of evolutionary information in a protein family, such as conservation and covariation, is often linked to its structural information. Multiple sequence alignments of distant homologous sequences are used to measure evolutive variables. Although high structural differences between proteins can be expected in such divergent alignments, most works linking evolutionary and structural information use a single structure ignoring the structural variability inside a protein family. The goal of this work is to elucidate the relevance of structural divergence when sequence-based measures are integrated with structural information. We found that inter-residue contacts and solvent accessibility undergo large variations in a protein family. Our results show that high covariation scores tend to reveal residue contacts that are conserved in the family, instead of protein or conformer specific contacts. We also found that residue accessible surface area shows a high variability between structures of the same family. As a consequence, the mean relative solvent accessibility of multiple structures correlates better with the conservation pattern than the relative solvent accessibility of a single structure. We conclude that the use of comprehensive structural information allows a more accurate interpretation of the information computed from sequence alignments. Therefore, considering structural divergence would lead to a better understanding of protein function, dynamics, and evolution."
29953937," The prevalence of unrecognised cryptic species impairs biodiversity estimates, clouds biological research and hinders conservation planning. As the rate of cryptic species detection increases globally, research is needed to determine how frequent cryptic species are, whether they are more common in given management regions, and whether these patterns are consistent across taxonomic groups. The Kimberley region in remote northwestern Australia harbours some of the most speciose, and morphologically and functionally diverse, endemic animal and plant communities on the continent. The rugged and changeable landscape also appears to contain a large proportion of cryptic terrestrial species, raising the question of whether similar patterns are also found among aquatic taxa, which have yet to be studied using integrative systematic approaches. If true, then the actual levels of aquatic biodiversity are yet to be fully realised. Here we conducted a molecular assessment of where species boundaries may exist in the Kimberley regions' most speciose freshwater fish family, the Terapontidae (grunters), with a combined morphological assessment of the regions' most speciose terapontid genus, Syncomistes. Assessment of nuclear markers (54 allozyme loci), sequence data (mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb); nuclear recombination activation gene one (RAG1)) and 31 meristic and 36 morphometric characters provides evidence for 13 new candidate species across three different genera. Many of these candidate species are narrow range endemics. Our findings raise several questions about the evolutionary origin of the Kimberley's endemic fish fauna and highlight the likelihood that freshwater fish species diversity in the Kimberley is severely under-represented by current systematic frameworks, with significant implications for ecological research, conservation and management."
29953936," Substance use disorders (SUD) are diseases of the brain, characterized by aberrant functioning in the neural circuitry of the brain. Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) can illuminate these functional changes by measuring the temporal coherence of low-frequency fluctuations of the blood oxygenation level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging signal in contiguous or non-contiguous regions of the brain. Because this data is easy to obtain and analyze, and therefore fairly inexpensive, it holds promise for defining biological treatment targets in SUD, which could help maximize the efficacy of existing clinical interventions and develop new ones. In an effort to identify the most likely ""treatment targets"" obtainable with rsFC we summarize existing research in SUD focused on 1) the relationships between rsFC and functionality within important psychological domains which are believed to underlie relapse vulnerability 2) changes in rsFC from satiety to deprived or abstinent states 3) baseline rsFC correlates of treatment outcome and 4) changes in rsFC induced by treatment interventions which improve clinical outcomes and reduce relapse risk. Converging evidence indicates that likely ""treatment target"" candidates, emerging consistently in all four sections, are reduced connectivity within executive control network (ECN) and between ECN and salience network (SN). Other potential treatment targets also show promise, but the literature is sparse and more research is needed. Future research directions include data-driven prediction analyses and rsFC analyses with longitudinal datasets that incorporate time since last use into analysis to account for drug withdrawal. Once the most reliable biological markers are identified, they can be used for treatment matching, during preliminary testing of new pharmacological compounds to establish clinical potential (""target engagement"") prior to carrying out costly clinical trials, and for generating hypotheses for medication repurposing."
29953935," Chronic heavy methamphetamine use likely causes dopaminergic neurotoxicity, which is commonly thought to result in cognitive control deficits. Both of these alterations may persist even after the use is discontinued, but tend to (partly) improve with increasing duration of abstinence. While several studies have demonstrated that the reinstatement of comparatively normal dopaminergic signaling may take months, if not years, the amelioration of cognitive deficits has predominantly been investigated in much shorter intervals of several weeks to less than half a year. Against this background, we set out to investigate the effects on prolonged abstinence in n = 27 abstinent former methamphetamine users in a cross-sectional design using behavioral and neurophysiological measures of cognitive control. Our behavioral results suggest that former users struggled to identify and adapt to different degrees of cognitive control requirements, which made their behavioral performance less expedient than that of healthy controls. On the neurophysiological level, this was reflected by reduced modulations of the N2-N450 amplitude in response to high vs. low cognitive control requirements. Yet, those effects could only be observed in methamphetamine users who had been abstinent for a relatively short time (mean 9.9; max. 18 months), but not in former users who had been abstinent two years or longer. While this finding alone does not allow for causal inferences, it suggests that the amelioration of control deficits may take longer than what is commonly investigated (1-6 months). Hence, some of the statements about permanent/irreversible dopamine-dependent executive dysfunctions in former methamphetamine users should be interpreted with caution."
29953934," Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective clinical intervention for various neuropsychiatric diseases. However, it is still unclear whether rTMS has an effect on cognitive functioning. In this review, we aimed to systematically evaluate the cognitive effects of rTMS in depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. We searched PubMed (1996-2018) under the set terms to review randomized controlled trials (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of rTMS administered to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and evaluated cognitive functions in patients with depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. Two authors reviewed each article and came to consensus on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All eligible studies were reviewed, duplicates were removed, and data were extracted individually. The search identified 579 articles, 31 of which met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among them, 15 were conducted in patients with depression, 11 in patients with schizophrenia, and 5 in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, 6 studies demonstrated a significant improvement of executive function across these diseases. Further, no evidence for cognitive adverse effects was found in these included rTMS studies. Although the heterogeneity between studies in terms of cognitive measures applied, stimulation parameters, and participants limits the ability to generalize conclusions, this review demonstrated that prefrontal rTMS could exert pro-cognitive effects on executive function and attention in some patients with depression but inconsistent cognitive impacts in any of the examined domains especially in patients with schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. The results warrant further rTMS studies that include systematic assessment of cognition across various neuropsychiatric diseases."
29953933," Antipsychotic drugs are the primary treatment for psychosis, yet individual response to their administration remains variable. At present, no biological predictors of response exist to guide clinicians as they select treatments for patients, and our understanding of the neurobiology underlying the heterogeneity of outcomes remains limited. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been applied by numerous studies to examine the response to antipsychotic treatment, though a large gap remains between their results and our clinical practice. To advance patient care with precision medicine approaches, prior work must be accounted for and built upon with future studies. This review provides an overview of studies that relate treatment outcome to various MRI-related measures, including structural, spectroscopic, diffusion tensor, and functional imaging. Knowledge derived from these studies will be discussed along with future directions for the field."
29953932," To evaluate the diagnostic potential based on histogram analysis of IVIM parameters between uterine cervical cancers (CC) - normal myometrium (Myo) versus CC - gluteus maximus muscle (GM) and to study the feasibility of histogram analysis of IVIM parameters to differentiate the early from locally advanced stage CCs. 64 patients with pathologically confirmed CC were enrolled. Histogram indices mean, median, 25th, and ð 75th percentile of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), true diffusion coefficient (D), pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D*), and perfusion fraction (f) value of entire tumor were statistically analyzed and compared between CC - GM versus CC - Myo, as well as between early and locally advanced stage CCs. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify indices that could best distinguish early from locally advanced stage CC. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were used to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of every histogram parameter. All the tested histogram indices significantly differed between the patients with CC - GM vs. CC - Myo, nonetheless, CC - GM yielded higher range area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.8-0.99 vs. 0.6-0.99. The additional significant difference was found among all the tested histogram indices of D*, mean, median, and 75th percentile of f, mean and 75th percentile of ADC, and 75th percentile of D discriminating early from locally advanced CCs. ROC curves indicated that the 75th percentile of D* value 28.17 × 10 The histogram analysis of IVIM parameters depicted that gluteus maximus served better reference tissue in comparison to myometrium. The histogram index 75th percentile of ADC, D, D*, and f may serve a diagnostic biomarker to differentiate the early from locally advanced stage CCs."
29953931," Cardiac ischemia/reperfusion, loss of blood flow and its subsequent restoration, causes damage to the heart. Oxidative stress from ischemia/reperfusion leads to dysfunction and death of cardiomyocytes, increasing the risk of progression to heart failure. Alterations in mitochondrial dynamics, in particular mitochondrial fission, have been suggested to play a role in cardioprotection from oxidative stress. We tested the hypothesis that activation of RhoA regulates mitochondrial fission in cardiomyocytes. Our studies show that expression of constitutively active RhoA in cardiomyocytes increases phosphorylation of Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) at serine-616, and leads to localization of Drp1 at mitochondria. Both responses are blocked by inhibition of Rho-associated Protein Kinase (ROCK). Endogenous RhoA activation by the GPCR agonist sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) also increases Drp1 phosphorylation and its mitochondrial translocation in a RhoA and ROCK dependent manner. Consistent with the role of mitochondrial Drp1 in fission, RhoA activation in cardiomyocytes leads to formation of smaller mitochondria and this is attenuated by inhibition of ROCK, by siRNA knockdown of Drp1 or by expression of a phosphorylation-deficient Drp1 S616A mutant. In addition, activation of RhoA prevents cell death in cardiomyocytes challenged by oxidative stress and this protection is blocked by siRNA knockdown of Drp1 or by Drp1 S616A expression. Taken together our findings demonstrate that RhoA activation can regulate Drp1 to induce mitochondrial fission and subsequent cellular protection, implicating regulation of fission as a novel mechanism contributing to RhoA-mediated cardioprotection."
29953930," Although high or repeated exposure to different forms of Hg can have serious health consequences, the most important toxicity risk for humans is as methylmercury (MeHg) which exposure is mainly through consumption of fish. Generally, more than the 80% of Hg in hair is as MeHg, which is taken up by hair follicles as MeHg-cysteine complexes. In this context, hair samples were collected from 200 children (7 years) living in a site in the North East (A) and from 299 children (6-11 years) living in a urban area of South Italy (B) to determine the levels of MeHg. Considering the neurotoxicity of MeHg, children were subjected to cognitive and neuropsychological tests. The hair values of Hg in the children population groups were comparable with data reported in other international surveys. On the other hand, combining results of the neurological tests with Hg levels, a possible relationship between Hg and an increase of the errors average reported in some neurological has been noted. Although the Hg levels were not elevated, a possible neurological influence in children, a population more susceptible than adults, might not be excluded. But the influence on neurological performances of the children could be also due to the family environment (socio economic status, educational level, etc.)."
29953929," Structural and functional abnormalities in the cerebral microvasculature have been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and animal models. One cause of hypoperfusion is the thickening of the cerebrovascular basement membrane (CVBM) due to increased collagen-IV deposition around capillaries. This study investigated whether these and other alterations in the cerebrovascular system associated with AD can be prevented by long-term dietary supplementation with the antioxidant ubiquinol (Ub) stabilized with Kaneka QH P30 powder containing ascorbic acid (ASC) in a mouse model of advanced AD (3 × Tg-AD mice, 12 months old). Animals were treated from prodromal stages of disease (3 months of age) with standard chow without or with Ub + ASC or ASC-containing vehicle and compared to wild-type (WT) mice. The number of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex was higher in female than in male 3 × Tg-AD mice. Extensive regions of hypoxia were characterized by a higher plaque burden in females only. This was abolished by Ub + ASC and, to a lesser extent, by ASC treatment. Irrespective of Aβ burden, increased collagen-IV deposition in the CVBM was observed in both male and female 3 × Tg-AD mice relative to WT animals; this was also abrogated in Ub + ASC- and ASC-treated mice. The chronic inflammation in the hippocampus and oxidative stress in peripheral leukocytes of 3 × Tg-AD mice were likewise reversed by antioxidant treatment. These results provide strong evidence that long-term antioxidant treatment can mitigate plasma oxidative stress, amyloid burden, and hypoxia in the AD brain parenchyma."
29953928," Skin has been increasingly recognized as an important drug administration route with topical formulations offering a targeted approach for the treatment of several dermatological disorders. The effectiveness of this route is hampered by its natural barrier, the stratum corneum (SC), and hence, different strategies have been investigated to improve percutaneous drug transport. The design of nanodelivery systems aiming at solving skin delivery issues have been largely explored, due to their potential to revolutionize dermal therapies, improving therapeutic effectiveness and reducing side effects. Apart from nanosystem benefits, the fulfilment of the reproducibility requirements and quality standards still limit their industrial production. The optimization of nanosystem formulation and manufacturing process is complex, usually involving a large number of variables. Therefore, a science- and risk-oriented approach, such as Quality by Design (QbD) will provide a comprehensive and noteworthy knowledge, yielding high quality drug products without extensive regulatory burden. This review aims to set up the basis for QbD development approach, encompassing preliminary and systematic risk assessments, with critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical material attributes (CMAs) identification, of different nanosystems potentially used in dermal therapies."
29953927," Risperidone is applied in oral dosage formulations in the treatment of mental diseases. Current trends point toward parenteral delivery systems based on poly(lactide-co-glycolide), with wafers or rods being the more attractive option than the routinely used intramuscular suspension with microparticles. The aim of our work was to study the utility of solution casting and hot melt extrusion in the formulation of wafers and rods with risperidone based on terpolymers, namely poly(lactide-co-glycolide-co-trimethylene carbonate) and poly(lactide-co-glycolide-co-ε-caprolactone). Synthesis of the terpolymers was carried out by using a non-toxic zirconium initiator and a racemic (LL/DD) or optically active form of the lactide monomer. The delivery systems were analyzed by NMR, DSC, GPC, and SEM. The release profile was monitored by HPLC. Terpolymer chain microstructure, glass transition temperature, and morphology revealed unchanged values after formulation. Solution casting resulted in a drop in molecular weight to a smaller degree than hot melt extrusion. The presence of risperidone influenced another decrease in molecular weight. Both methods are adequate for the formulation of delivery systems based on terpolymers for prolonged release of risperidone. An adequate selection of monomer composition in terpolymers allows to control the release period. Risperidone was released in three phases, however, the burst effect was observed for poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide-co-ε-caprolactone)."
29953926," Monoamine oxidase (MAO), a mitochondrial enzyme that oxidizes biogenic amines generating hydrogen peroxide, is a major source of oxidative stress in cardiac injury. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its overactivation in pathological conditions are still poorly characterized. Here, we investigated whether the enhanced MAO-dependent hydrogen peroxide production can be due to increased substrate availability using a metabolomic profiling method. We identified N"
29953925," Apathy is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to explore its associated neural substrates changes via amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and granger causality analysis (GCA). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans were performed in 20 PD patients with apathy (PD-A), 22 PD patients without apathy (PD-NA) and 19 healthy volunteers. GCA, a new method exploring direction from one brain region to another, was based on brain regions showing alterations of neural activity as seeds, which were examined utilizing ALFF approach. The relationships between ALFF or GCA and apathetic symptoms were also assessed. Relative to PD-NA group, PD-A group indicated decreased ALFF in left orbital middle frontal gyrus and bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG). Only ALFF values in right SFG were negatively correlated with Apathy Scale (AS) scores. Then GCA with the seed of right SFG showed a positive feedback from right thalamus to ipsilateral SFG, which was positively correlated with AS scores. In conclusion, dysfunction in SFG and a positive feedback from thalamus to ipsilateral SFG contributed to presence of PD-related apathy, providing a new perspective for future studies on apathy in PD."
29953924," Many studies have reported that MTHFR C677T (rs 1801133) polymorphism is associated with the risk of alcohol dependence(AD). However, there are conflicting results regarding this relationship. In this article, we performed a meta-analysis of case-control studies to assess synthetically the influence of MTHFR C677T polymorphism on the risk of AD. All relevant studies were searched from Cochrane Library, EmBase, PubMed, and Web of science. 7 studies were included to evaluate the strength of associations between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and AD by pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The present meta-analysis evaluated a total of 1066 AD patients and 1049 controls and showed that MTHFR C677T polymorphism was not significantly associated with AD susceptibility in all five genetic models (Allelic, T vs C: OR = 1.04,95% CI: 0.83-1.31, P = 0.73; Homozygous, TT vs CC: OR = 0.98,95% CI: 0.57-1.68, P = 0.94; Heterozygous, TT vs CT: OR = 0.87,95% CI: 0.64-1.19, P = 0.39; Dominant, TT + CT vs CC: OR = 1.12,95% CI: 0.92-1.35, P = 0.26; Recessive, TT vs CT + CC: OR = 0.93,95% CI: 0.58-1.47, P = 0.74). On subgroup analysis by ethnicity, there was still insignificant association was detected in the Caucasians and Asians under the five genetic models respectively. In conclusion, the present data revealed that MTHFR C677T polymorphism may not be associated with AD susceptibility. Further well designed studies in a larger population and biological functional analysis of MTHFR are needed to elucidate the role of MTHFR C677T Gene polymorphism in AD."
29953923," There are global efforts in developing therapeutic strategies for central nervous system (CNS) injuries using multimodal approaches. Nogo receptor type 1 (NgR1) has been known as a primary molecule limiting neuronal regeneration in the adult CNS. We identified lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS) as an endogenous NgR1 antagonist. Membrane-bound LOTUS interacts with NgR1 and inhibits its function by blocking its ligand binding. Five molecules including Nogo, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (OMgp), B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) have been identified as NgR1 ligands. These ligands bind to NgR1 and activate NgR1 signaling, leading to axon growth inhibition such as growth cone collapse and neurite outgrowth inhibition. We have recently reported that the soluble form of LOTUS (s-LOTUS) also suppressed NgR1-mediated signaling induced by myelin axonal inhibitors (MAIs) including Nogo, MAG and OMgp by binding with both NgR1 and its co-receptor p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75"
29953922," The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a multi subunit protein complex that generates reactive oxygen species at cell membranes and within phagosomes. It is essential for host defence as evidenced by the severe immunodeficiency syndrome caused by a loss of one of the subunits. This is known as chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). However, the phagocyte NADPH oxidase also has a key role to play in regulating immunity and it is notable that chronic granulomatous disease is also characterised by autoimmune and autoinflammatory manifestations. This is because reactive oxygen species play a role in regulating signalling through their ability to post-translationally modify amino acid residues such as cysteine and methionine. In this review, I will outline the major aspects of innate immunity that are regulated by the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, including control of transcription, autophagy, the inflammasome and type 1 interferon signalling."
29953921," Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites of the host cells. A commonly accepted view is the requirement of internal membranous structures for various aspects of viral life cycle. Organelles enable favourable intracellular environment for several viruses. However, studies reporting organelle dynamics upon viral infections are scant. In this review, we aim to summarize and highlight modulations caused to various organelles upon viral infection or expression of its proteins."
29953920," Insertional activity of transposable elements (TEs) has had a major impact on the human genome; approximately one-half to two-thirds of the genome sequence is likely to be derived from TE insertions. Several families of human TEs - primarily Alu, L1 and SVA - continue to actively transpose, thereby generating insertional polymorphisms among individual genomes. The impact that TE insertions have on their human hosts' fitness, and accordingly the role that natural selection plays in shaping patterns of TE polymorphisms among populations, have yet to be systematically evaluated using whole genome sequence data. We present here a population genomic study of the effects of natural selection on human genetic variation that results from the recent activity of TEs. We developed a genome-wide scan for selection on human TE polymorphisms and applied it to a dataset of 14,384 locus-specific TE insertions characterized for 1511 individuals from 15 populations. Our TE selection scan looks for anomalously high population-specific TE insertion allele frequencies that are consistent with the action of positive (adaptive) selection. To control for the effects of demographic history, we compared the observed patterns of population-specific TE insertion allele frequencies to a neutral evolutionary model generated using time forward simulation of TE insertion allele frequencies among human population groups. This approach uncovered seven cases of polymorphic TE insertions that appear to have increased in frequency within specific human populations owing to the effects of positive selection. Five of the seven putatively selected TE insertions map to tissue-specific enhancers, and two cases correspond to expression quantitative trait loci that are associated with inter-individual gene regulatory differences. This study represents the first report of recent, local adaptation acting on polymorphic human TEs."

Various aspects of ribosomal proteins have related to cell growth, cell cycle, and diseases. Ribosomal protein L10A (RpL10A) in shrimp and fruit fly has been demonstrated to play a role in oogenesis. Interestingly, deletion RpL10A gene (RpL10Ab"
29953918," Serum folate is important in clinical researches and DNA synthesis and methylation. Some loci and genes that are associated with folate levels had been detected by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), such as rs1801133 in MTHFR and rs1979277 in SHMT1. Nevertheless, only a small part of variants has been clearly identified for serum folate. Hence, we conducted a GWAS to discover new inherited susceptibility and gene-environment interactions on serum folate concentration. In a healthy Chinese population of 1999 men, genotyping was performed using Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip. Serum folate levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), pathway enrichment analysis and statistical analysis were performed by Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and Statistic Package for Social Science (SPSS). We validated that rs1801133 in MTHFR was significantly involved in serum folate (P = 4.21 × 10 In a male Chinese population, genome-wide association study discovered that three novel SNPs rs3782886, rs671 and rs4646776 of ALDH2 gene were suggestively significantly associated with serum folate levels."

29953916," Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) infection causes most variable clinical syndromes from chronic or latent infection to acute death, and it is generally acknowledged that the course of disease is affected by both virus and host factors. To compare host immune responses to differentially virulent CSFV strains in pigs, fifteen 8-week-old specific-pathogen-free pigs were randomly divided into four groups and inoculated with the CSFV Shimen strain (a highly virulent strain), the HLJZZ2014 strain (a moderately virulent strains), C-strain (an avirulent strain), and DMEM (mock control), respectively. Infection with the Shimen or HLJZZ2014 strain resulted in fever, clinical signs and histopathological lesions, which were not observed in the C-strain-inoculated pigs, though low viral genome copies were detected in the peripheral blood and tissue samples. The data showed that the virulence of the strains affected the outcome of duration and intensity of the disease rather than the tissue tropism of the virus. Furthermore, leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, differentiation of T-cells, and the secretion of cytokines associated with inflammation or apoptosis such as interferon alpha (IFN-α), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 were induced by the virulent CSFV infection, the differences reflected in onset and extent of the regulation. Taken together, our results revealed that the major differences among the three strains resided in the kinetics of host response to the infection: severe and immediate with the highly virulent strain, while progressive and delayed with the moderately virulent one. This comparative study will help to dissect the pathogenesis of CSFV."
29953915," Leptin and its receptor are widely distributed in several tissues, mainly in white adipose tissue. The serum leptin is highly correlated with body mass index in rodents and humans, being documented that leptin levels reduces in the fasting state and increase during refeeding, similarly to insulin release by pancreatic islets. Insulin appears to increase leptin mRNA and protein expression and its release by adipocytes. Some studies have suggested that insulin acts through the activation of the transcription factors: sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), CCAAT enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBP-α) and specificity protein 1 (Sp1). Insulin stimulates the release of preformed and newly synthesized leptin by adipocytes through its signaling cascade. Its effects are blocked by inhibitors of the insulin signaling pathway, as well as by inhibitors of protein synthesis and agents that increase the intracellular cAMP. The literature data suggest that chronic hyperinsulinemia increases serum leptin levels in humans and rodents. In this review, we summarized the most updated knowledge on the effects of insulin on serum leptin levels, presenting the cell mechanisms that control leptin synthesis and release by the white adipose tissue."
29953914," The intra-islet endothelial cells (ECs), the building blocks of islet microvasculature, govern a number of cellular and pathophysiological processes associated with the pancreatic tissue. These cells are key to the angiogenic process and essential for islet revascularization after transplantation. Understanding fundamental mechanisms by which ECs regulate the angiogenic process is important as these cells maintain and regulate the intra-islet environment facilitated by a complex signaling crosstalk with the surrounding endocrine cells. In recent years, many studies have demonstrated the impact of epigenetic regulation on islet cell development and function. This review will present an overview of the reports involving endothelial epigenetic mechanisms particularly focusing on histone modifications which have been identified to play a critical role in governing EC functions by modifying the chromatin structure. A better understanding of epigenetic mechanisms by which these cells regulate gene expression and function to orchestrate cellular physiology and pathology is likely to offer improved insights on the functioning and regulation of an intra-islet endothelial microvascular environment."
29953913," The endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling system is one of the most extensive of the mammalian brain. Despite the involvement of only few specific ligands and receptors, the system encompasses a vast diversity of triggered mechanisms and driven effects. It mediates a wide range of phenomena, including the regulation of transmitter release, neural excitability, synaptic plasticity, impulse spread, long-term neuronal potentiation, neurogenesis, cell death, lineage segregation, cell migration, inflammation, oxidative stress, nociception and the sleep cycle. It is also known to be involved in the processes of learning and memory formation. This extensive scope of action is attained by combining numerous variables. In a properly functioning brain, the correlations of these variables are kept in a strictly controlled balance; however, this balance is disrupted in many pathological conditions. However, while this balance is known to be disrupted by drugs in the case of addicts, the stimuli and mechanisms influencing the neurodegenerating brain remain elusive. This review examines the multiple factors and phenomena affecting the eCB signaling system in the brain. It evaluates techniques of controlling the eCB system to identify the obstacles in their applications and highlights the crucial interdependent variables that may influence biomedical research outcomes."
29953912," Despite numerous studies conducted, multidrug-resistant infections such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSE) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are still increasing in hospitals, and yet continued to be the important challenges of worldwide health. Mathematical modeling gives an insightful information in policy and decision making to control the transmission and spread of these infections globally. We formulated and analyse a mathematical model to characterise the transmission co-dynamics of hospital-acquired MRSE (HA-MRSA) and community-acquired MRSE (CA-MRSA) and to investigate the long run competitiveness of the two strains in hospital. Numerical simulations are carried out to explore the basic reproduction numbers for the two strains so as to determine the dominant strain in the future in hospital setting. Under some conditions, invasion reproduction numbers are also applied to determine the uniform persistence of the two strains. We further performed sensitivity analysis to examine the influence of model parameters on the transmission and spread of the the strains, thereby determine the effective intervention strategies that reduce the overflow of the infections in hospital setting. To support theoretical findings qualitatively, graphical representations are provided."
29953911," To determine if there are any changes in brain metastases or resection cavity volumes between planning magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and radiosurgical (RS) treatment and if these led to a change in management or alteration in the RS plan. Patients undergoing RS for brain metastasis or tumor resection cavities had a standardized planning MRI (MRI-1) performed and a repeat verification MRI (MRI-2) 24 hours prior to RS. Any change in management, including re-planning based on MRI-2 was recorded. 34 patients with a total of 59 lesions (44 metastases and 15 tumor resection cavities) were assessed with a median time between MRI-1 and MRI-2 of 7 days. 17 patients (50%) required a change in management based on the changes seen on MRI-2. For patients with 7 days or less between scans, 41% of patients (9/22) required a change in management, whereas for patients with 8 days or more between scans 78% (7/9) of patients required this. Per lesion, 32 out of 59 lesions required re-planning, including 7/15 (47%) cavities and 25/44 (57%) metastases, with the most common reason (23 lesions) being an increase in gross target volume (tumor) or clinical target volume (tumor cavity). Measurable changes occur in brain metastasis over a short amount of time with a change in management required in 41% of patients with 7 days between MRI-1 and MRI-2, and 78% of patients when there is a delay longer than 7 days. We therefore recommend that the time between planning MRI and radiosurgical treatment is as short as possible."
29953910," Hypofractionated (>5 fraction) stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) may allow for ablative biologically equivalent dose to tumors with a lower risk of organ-at-risk (OAR) toxicity in central thoracic tumors. Adaptive planning may further improve OAR sparing while maintaining planning target volume (PTV) coverage. We hypothesized that mid-treatment adaptive re-planning would offer dosimetric advantages during HSRT for central thorax malignancies using magnetic resonance image-guided radiotherapy (MR-IGRT). Twelve patients with central thorax tumors received HSRT using MR-IGRT. Clinically delivered regimens were 60Gy/12fractions or 62.5Gy/10fractions, with low-field-MR (0.35T) volumetric setup imaging acquired at each fraction. Daily GTV/OAR were retrospectively re-defined on fraction 1, 6, and 10 MRIs, and GTV response was recorded. Simulated initial plans prescribed a dose of 60Gy/12fx based on fraction 1 MRIs. Mid-treatment adaptive plans were created based on fraction 6 (fx6) anatomy-of-the-day. All plans were created using an isotoxicity approach with goal 95% PTV coverage, subject to hard OAR constraints, to represent clinically ideal OAR sparing. Plans were then compared for projected OAR sparing/PTV coverage. Patients demonstrated significant on-treatment MRI-defined GTV reduction (median 41.8%; range 16.7-65.7%). At fx6, median reduction was 26.7%. All initial plans met OAR constraints. Initial plan application to fx6 and fx10 anatomy resulted in 8 OAR violations (5/13 patients) and 10 OAR violations (6/13 patients), respectively. All fx6 violations persisted at fx10. Midpoint adaptive planning reversed 100% of midpoint OAR violations and tended to reduce the magnitude of OAR violations incurred at fx10. In 40% (2/5) of fractions where OAR violation resulted from initial plan application to fx6 anatomy, PTV coverage was increased concomitantly with violation reversal. Mid-treatment adaptive planning based on tumor response may be dosimetrically advantageous for sparing of surrounding critical structures in HSRT for central thorax malignancies and could be applied using either an online or offline paradigm."
29953908," Age-related hearing decline typically includes threshold shifts as well as reduced wave I auditory brainstem response (ABR) amplitudes due to cochlear synaptopathy/neuropathy, which may compromise precise coding of suprathreshold speech envelopes. This is supported by findings with older listeners, who have difficulties in envelope and speech processing, especially in noise. However, separating the effects of threshold elevation, synaptopathy, and degradation by noise on physiological representations may be difficult. In the present study, the effects of notched, low- and high-pass noise on envelope following responses (EFRs) in aging were compared when sound levels (aged: 85 dB SPL; young: 60-80 dB SPL) were matched between groups peripherally, by matching wave I ABR amplitudes, or centrally by matching EFR amplitudes. Low-level notched noise reduced EFRs to sinusoidally amplitude modulated (SAM) tones in young animals for notch widths up to 2 octaves. High-pass noise above the carrier frequency reduced EFRs. Young animals showed EFR reductions at lower noise levels. Low-pass noise did not reduce EFRs in either young or aged animals. High-pass noise may affect EFR amplitudes in young animals more than aged by reducing the contributions of high-frequency sensitive inputs. EFRs to SAM tones in modulated noise (NAM) suggest that neurons of young animals can synchronize to NAM at lower sound levels and maintain dual AM representations better than older animals. The overall results show that EFR amplitudes are strongly influenced by aging and the presence of a competing sound that likely reduces or shifts the pool of responsive neurons."
29953907," Predators induce defensive responses and fear behaviours in prey. The rat exposure test (RET) is frequently used as an animal model of panic. Nitric oxide (NO) which has been reported to be activated by the NMDA receptor, in turn mediates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signalling pathways in defensive responses. ACCN2, the orthologous human gene of acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a), is also associated with panic disorder; however, few studies have focused on the roles of ASIC1a in the modulation of panic and calcium/CaMKII signalling by NO. In the present study, NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME; non-selective NOS inhibitor), S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine (SNAP; NO donor), and psalmotoxin (PcTx-1; selective ASIC1a blocker) were administered to the dorsal periaqueductal grey (dPAG) before the predator stimulus, and the roles of NO in the expression of ASIC1a, phosphorylation of CaMKIIα (p-CaMKIIα) and expression of calmodulin (CaM) were investigated. The effects of ASIC1a, p-CaMKIIα and CaM regulation were also examined. Our results showed that intra-dPAG infusion of L-NAME weakened panic-like behaviour and decreased ASIC1a, p-CaMKIIα and CaM expression levels, whereas intra-dPAG infusion of SNAP enhanced panic-like behaviour and increased ASIC1a, p-CaMKIIα and CaM levels. Intra-dPAG infusion of PcTx-1 also weakened panic-like behaviour and decreased p-CaMKIIα expression level. Taken together, these results indicate that NO and ASIC1a are involved in the modulation of RET-induced panic-like behaviour in the dPAG. NO regulates the calcium/CaMKII signalling pathways, and ASIC1a participates in this regulation."
29953906," Auditory neglect has been found in adults with right hemisphere focal brain lesions following strokes. Visual and tactile neglect has been found in children following both left and right hemisphere lesions resulting from perinatal strokes. The present cross-sectional study assessed auditory neglect in children with early unilateral brain damage from perinatal stroke. Twenty-six children with perinatal stroke and matched controls participated. All were asked to identify the location of a pure tone presented in left or right auditory fields. We found that children who had experienced left hemisphere perinatal strokes were significantly better at localizing sounds on the left side of space than the right side of space, and that response times improved with age on a normal trajectory relative to controls in left hemispace, while they did not improve normally in right hemispace. Children with right hemisphere perinatal strokes were significantly worse at localizing sounds on the right side of space relative to typically developing controls, and did not follow control trajectories for improvement in response times on the left or the right sides of space. Our preliminary results suggest that left hemisphere perinatal strokes may result in contralateral auditory neglect, while right hemisphere perinatal strokes may result in bilateral auditory neglect. Neglect was more severe in children with parietal lobe involvement, suggesting that the parietal lobe may play a dominant role in auditory attention in the developing brain."

29953904," It has been suggested that the orexin system modulates learning and memory-related processes. However, the possible influence that training could have on the effect of the blockade of orexin-A selective receptor (OX1R) on a spatial memory task has not been explored. Therefore, the present study attempts to compare the effects of OX1R antagonist SB-334867 infusion on spatial memory in two different conditions in the Morris Water Maze (MWM). This experiment evaluated the animals' performance in weak training (2 trials per session) vs strong training (6 trials per session) protocols in a spatial version of the MWM. We found that in the 2-trial condition the post-training SB-334867 infusion had a negative effect on consolidation as well as on the retention and reversal learning of the task 72 h later. This effect was not apparent in the 6-trial condition. In addition, while the strong training groups showed a general increase in c-Fos expression in several brain areas of the hippocampal-thalamic-cortical circuit, SB-334867 administration had the opposite effect in areas that have been previously reported to have a high density of OX1R. Specifically, the SB-infused group in the 2-trial condition showed a decrease in c-Fos immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus, granular retrosplenial and prelimbic cortices, and centrolateral thalamic nucleus. This was not observed for subjects in the 6-trial condition. The activation of these areas could constitute a neuroanatomical substrate involved in the compensatory mechanisms of training upon SB-334867 impairing effects on a MWM spatial task."
29953903," Aberrant activation of toll-like receptor (TLR)s results in persistent and prolonged neuroinflammation and has been implicated in the pathogenesis and exacerbation of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. TLR3 coordinates the innate immune response to viral infection and recent data have demonstrated that inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme that primarily metabolizes anandamide, modulates TLR3-mediated neuroinflammation. However, the physiological and behavioural consequences of such modulation are unknown. The present study examined the effect of URB597, a selective FAAH inhibitor, on neuroinflammation, physiological and behavioural alterations following administration of the TLR3 agonist and viral mimetic poly I:C to female rats. URB597 attenuated TLR3-mediated fever, mechanical and cold allodynia, and anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus maze and open field arena. There was no effect of URB597 on TLR3-mediated decreases in body weight and no effect in the sucrose preference or forced swim tests. URB597 attenuated the TLR3-mediated increase in the expression of CD11b and CD68, markers of microglia/macrophage activation. In summary, these data demonstrate that enhancing FAAH substrate levels suppresses TLR3-mediated microglia/macrophage activation and associated changes in fever, nociceptive responding and anxiety-related behaviour. These data provide further support for FAAH as a novel therapeutic target for neuroinflammatory disorders."
29953902," The introduction of atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) since the discovery of its prototypical drug clozapine has been a revolutionary pharmacological step for treating psychotic patients as these allow a significant recovery not only in terms of hospitalization and reduction in severity symptoms, but also in terms of safety, socialization and better rehabilitation in the society. Regarding the mechanism of action, AAPs are weak D"
29953901," Dysregulation of cell metabolism and redox balance is implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Because the cell proliferation and apoptotic regulatory pathways are interconnected with metabolic and redox signalling pathways, the current mono-target treatment is ineffective, and multi-drug resistance remains common. Complex diseases are often implicated in a network-based context of pathology; therefore, a new holistic intervention approach is required to block multi-crosstalk in such complicated circumstances. The use of therapeutic agents isolated from herbs to holistically modulate metabolism and redox state has been shown to relieve carcinoma growth and the inflammatory response in autoimmune disorders. Multiple clinically applied or novel herbal chemicals with metabolic and redox modulatory capacity as well as low toxicity have recently been identified. Moreover, new metabolic targets and mechanisms of drug action have been discovered, leading to the exploration of new pathways for drug repositioning, clinical biomarker spectra, clinical treatment strategies and drug development. Taken together with multiple supporting examples, the modulation of cell metabolism and the redox capacity using herbal chemicals is emerging as a new, alternative strategy for the holistic treatment of cancer and autoimmune disorders. In the future, the development of new diagnostic tools based on the detection of metabolic and redox biomarkers, reformulation of optimized herbal compositions using artificial intelligence, and the combination of herbs with mono-targeting drugs will reveal new potential for clinical application."
29953900," Neurosteroids are neuroactive brain-born steroids. They can act through non-genomic and/or through genomic pathways. Genomic pathways are largely described for steroid hormones: the binding to nuclear receptors leads to transcription regulation. Pregnenolone, Dehydroepiandrosterone, their respective sulfate esters and Allopregnanolone have no corresponding nuclear receptor identified so far whereas some of their non-genomic targets have been identified. Neuroplasticity is the capacity that neuronal networks have to change their structure and function in response to biological and/or environmental signals; it is regulated by several mechanisms, including those that involve neurosteroids. In this review, after a description of their biosynthesis, the effects of Pregnenolone, Dehydroepiandrosterone, their respective sulfate esters and Allopregnanolone on their targets will be exposed. We then shall highlight that neurosteroids, by acting on these targets, can regulate neurogenesis, structural and functional plasticity. Finally, we will discuss the therapeutic potential of neurosteroids in the pathophysiology of neurological diseases in which alterations of neuroplasticity are associated with changes in neurosteroid levels."
29953899," High-throughput screens in cancer cell lines (CCLs) have been used for decades to help researchers identify compounds with the potential to improve the treatment of cancer and, more recently, to identify genomic susceptibilities in cancer via genome-wide shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 screens. Additionally, rich genomic and transcriptomic data of these CCLs has allowed researchers to pair this screening data with biological features, enabling efforts to identify biomarkers of treatment response and gene dependencies. In this paper, we review the major CCL screening efforts and the large datasets these screens have made available. We also assess the CCL screens collectively and include a resource with harmonized CCL and compound identifiers to facilitate comparisons across screens. The CCLs in these screens were found to represent a wide range of cancer types, with a strong correlation between the representation of a cancer type and its associated mortality. Patient ages and gender distributions of CCLs were generally as expected, with some notable exceptions of female underrepresentation in certain disease types. Also, ethnicity information, while largely incomplete, suggests that African American and Hispanic patients may be severely underrepresented in these screens. Nearly all genes were targeted in the genetic perturbations screens, but the compounds used for the drug screens target less than half of known cancer drivers, likely reflecting known limitations in our drug design capabilities. Finally, we discuss recent developments in the field and the promise they hold for enabling future screens to overcome previous limitations and lead to new breakthroughs in cancer treatment."
29953898," In this study, we examined how any, full, and partial breastfeeding durations were associated with maternal risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and how prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference 7 years postpartum influenced these associations. A total of 63,260 women with live-born singleton infants in the Danish National Birth Cohort (1996-2002) were included. Interviews during pregnancy and 6 and 18 months postpartum provided information on prepregnancy weight, height, and the duration of full and partial breastfeeding. Waist circumference was self-reported 7 years postpartum. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios of incident hypertension and CVD, registered in the National Patient Register from either 18 months or 7 years postpartum through 15 years postpartum. Any breastfeeding ≥4 months was associated with 20-30% lower risks of hypertension and CVD compared to <4 months in both normal/underweight and overweight/obese women. At follow-up starting 7 years postpartum, similar risk reductions were observed after accounting for waist circumference adjusted for BMI. Partial breastfeeding >2 months compared to ≤2 months, following up to 6 months of full breastfeeding, was associated with 10-25% lower risk of hypertension and CVD. Compared with short breastfeeding duration, additional partial breastfeeding was as important as additional full breastfeeding in reducing risk of hypertension and CVD. Altogether, longer duration of breastfeeding was associated with lower maternal risk of hypertension and CVD irrespective of prepregnancy BMI and abdominal adiposity 7 years after delivery. Both full and partial breastfeeding contributed to an improved cardiovascular health in mothers."
29953897," We examined the use of automated voice recognition (AVR) messages targeting smokers from primary care practices located in underserved urban and rural communities to promote smoking cessation. We partnered with urban and rural primary care medical offices (n = 7) interested in offering this service to patients. Current smokers, 18 years and older, who had completed an office visit within the previous 12 months, from these sites were used to create a smoker's registry. Smokers were recruited within an eight county region of western New York State between June 2012 and August 2013. Participants were contacted over six month intervals using the AVR system. Among 5812 smokers accrued 1899 (32%) were reached through the AVR system and 55% (n = 1049) continued to receive calls. Smokers with race other than white or African American were less likely to be reached (OR = 0.71, 0.57-0.90), while smokers ages 40 and over were more likely to be reached. Females (OR = 0.78, 0.65-0.95) and persons over age 40 years were less likely to opt out, while rural smokers were more likely to opt out (OR = 3.84, 3.01-4.90). Among those receiving AVR calls, 30% reported smoke free (self-reported abstinence over a 24 h period) at last contact; smokers from rural areas were more likely to report being smoke free (OR = 1.41, 1.01-1.97). An AVR-based smoking cessation intervention provided added value beyond typical tobacco cessation efforts available in these primary care offices. This intervention required no additional clinical staff time and served to satisfy a component of patient center medical home requirements for practices."
29953896," Giant cell arteritis (GCA) primarily involves medium-to-large arteries. Small vessel inflammation is a recognized phenomenon occurring in association with GCA. However, its significance is poorly elucidated. Histologic sections and medical records of105 temporal artery specimens were retrospectively reviewed between 2008 and 2017 to examine associated clinical manifestations and laboratory data including ANA and p-ANCA titers. Immunohistochemical staining for CD4 and CD8 was performed in select cases to assess the nature of the inflammatory response. Seventy-eight patients meeting diagnostic criteria of temporal arteritis were included in the analysis. Twenty-eight specimens demonstrated temporal arteritis with small arterial inflammation (SAI) and 50 specimens showed temporal arteritis without small arterial inflammation. Eight of 28 (28.6%) patients with SAI presented with jaw claudication while 5 (17.9%) were febrile at presentation. In contrast, in 50 patients without SAI, jaw claudication and fever were seen in 11 and 2 cases, respectively (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0047 respectively). No statistically significant difference was noted between other symptoms and lab indices between two groups. Elevated p-ANCA titers in GCA may be associated with concomitant polymyalgia rheumatica or treatment-resistant disease. We also identified a higher count of CD4 and CD8 T cells in SAI cases, even though the ratio of CD4/CD8 T lymphocytes was within normal limits. In conclusion, simultaneous involvement of arterioles and medium to large sized arteries is common in GCA, and may be associated with treatment refractory disease.

29953894," Some thyroid carcinomas (TCs) have a violent biological behavior and poor prognosis, and lacking of effective molecular markers is still the main obstacle for clinical stratified diagnosis and treatment of TC. The aim of the study was to discover the clinicopathological and prognostic implications of Src homology region 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) and Hook microtubule tethering protein 1(Hook1) expression in TC. The expression of SHP2 and Hook1was detected by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays from 313 primary TC who underwent surgery during January 2006 and January 2010 in Zhejiang Cancer Hospital. Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional-hazards regression models were employed to analyze the associations between their expressions and clinicopathological features and prognosis. The expression rate of SHP2 and Hook1 in TC was 57.5% (180/313) and 22.0% (69/313), respectively. SHP2 was positively correlated with Hook1 in TC. SHP2 expression differed significantly by age, histological variants, maximal tumor diameter, intrathyroidal dissemination, metastases, and disease stage (P < 0.05). Moreover, Patients with high SHP2 expression had reduced risk for death of disease compared to those with low SHP2 expression (Hazard ratio [HR] = 0.267, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.105-0.684, P = 0.006) in univariate analysis, but that multivariate analysis failed to suggest that SHP2 was an independent prognostic factor. Hook1 expression differed significantly by histological variants, maximal tumor diameter, and intrathyroidal dissemination (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant correlation between Hook1 expression and outcome in TC (P > 0.05). Our results suggested that SHP2 may be a favorable indicator of prognosis in TC."
29953893," Combined delivery of a therapeutic small interfering RNA (siRNA) and a chemotherapeutic agent to cancer cells is promising as anticancer therapy, which could offer enhanced cell killing potential and low side effect. However, simultaneous delivery to tumor is challenging. In our study, cholesterol-modified low molecular weight chitosan (MW ~ 15 kDa) was employed as a self-assembled delivery system for both siRNA and a hydrophobic chemotherapeutic agent, curcumin to cancer cells. The siRNA/curcumin loaded nanoparticles (C-CCM/siRNA) were physico-chemically characterized for particle size (165 ± 2.6 nm) and zeta potential (+24.8 ± 2.2 mV). The ability of CCM to condense siRNA was determined by ethidium bromide exclusion and gel retardation assay using electrophoresis. The result demonstrated that the condensation of C-CCM with siRNA was optimum at minimum N/P ratio of 40. C-CCM/siRNA was stable at 4 °C for a period of >1 month. C-CCM/siRNA was taken up efficiently by human lung carcinoma cells, A549 in a time-dependent manner. The cellular internalization of C-CCM/siRNA was observed via clathrin-mediated endocytosis as determined by using specific endocytosis inhibitors. The study demonstrated the feasibility of the use of cholesterol conjugated chitosan as a co-delivery system for both siRNA and a hydrophobic drug for combination cancer therapy."

29953891," G-quadruplex (G4) structures are known to be promising anticancer drug targets and flavonols (an important class of flavonoids) are small molecules reported to possess several health-promoting properties including those of anticancer activities. In this work, we explored the interactions of the structurally related plant flavonols kaempferol (KAE; 3,5,7,4'OH flavone) and morin (MOR; 3,5,7,2',4'OH flavone) with various G4-DNA sequences along with duplex DNA using a combination of spectroscopic and molecular docking studies. Our results revealed that KAE shows preferential interaction with VEGF G4-DNA in comparison to the other G4 sequences and duplex DNA. Moreover, KAE enhances the thermal stability of VEGF G4-DNA. In contrast, MOR exhibits an appreciably weaker level of interaction with both duplex and various G4-DNAs, with no significant structural specificity. The contrasting DNA binding behaviors suggest a crucial role of the 2'OH substituent in the B-ring of flavonol moiety. While KAE is relatively planar, MOR adopts a significantly non-planar conformation attributable to steric hindrance from the additional 2'OH substituent. This small structural difference is apparently very important for the ability of KAE and MOR to interact with VEGF G4-DNA. Thus, KAE (but not MOR) appears to be an effective ligand for VEGF G4-DNA, opening up possibilities of its application for regulation of gene expression in cancer cells."

29953889," The southern house vector, Culex quinquefasciatus is the paramount cause of Japanese encephalitis, West Nile fever and Lymphatic Filariasis, which is globally affecting the worldwide population. Many attempts were made by researchers with different perceptions to discover regimen against these aforementioned ailments but the output was not that effectual. Consequently, there is an imminent need to develop very effective and potential treatment against these perilous diseases. Employing immunoinformatic approaches, we have designed the multi-epitope subunit vaccine by exploring salivary proteins of Culex quinquefasciatus, which possess both antigenic and potent immunogenic behaviour. The immunogenic epitopes from the immune cells (B-cell, CTL, and HTL) were predicted and linked together with the help of linkers. Apart from this, at the N-terminal of the construct, an adjuvant was added in order to enhance the immunogenicity of the vaccine. The physiological parameters, antigenicity and allergenicity were also evaluated for the designed vaccine construct. Molecular docking between ligand (vaccine construct) and TLR-4 receptor was performed. Molecular dynamics simulation of the docked complex was performed to identify the stability, patterns, macromolecules interactions and their behaviour. Finally, to ensure the translation and gene expression efficiency of designed construct, insilico restriction cloning was executed into suitable expression vector pET28a."

29953886," It has been widely reported that ketamine rescues chronic stress-induced depression-like behavior, but the underlying cellular mechanisms of the rapid antidepressant actions of ketamine remain largely unclear. Both male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were used and received modified learned helplessness paradigm to induce depression-like behavior. Depression-like behavior was assayed and manipulated using forced swim tests, sucrose preference tests and pharmacological microinjection. We conducted whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings in the midbrain ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) neurons. Surface and cytosolic glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor expression were analyzed using Western blotting. Phosphorylated GluR1 expression was quantified using Western blotting analysis. The results showed that a single systemic administration of a ketamine metabolite (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (2R,6R-HNK) rapidly rescued chronic stress-induced depression-like behavior and persisted for up to 21 days. Consistently, the chronic stress-induced diminished glutamatergic transmission and surface GluR1 expression in the vlPAG were also reversed by a single systemic injection of (2R,6R)-HNK. Furthermore, bath application of (2R,6R)-HNK increased the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in the vlPAG. Further evidence for the antidepressant action of (2R,6R)-HNK is provided by the finding that microinjection of (2R,6R)-HNK into the vlPAG exhibited a rapid-acting and long-lasting antidepressant effect. This antidepressant effect of (2R,6R)-HNK was prevented by the intra-vlPAG microinjection of AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX. Together, the current results provide evidence that (2R,6R)-HNK rescues chronic stress-induced depression-like behavior with rapid-acting and long-lasting antidepressant effects through enhancement of AMPA receptor-mediated transmission in the vlPAG."
29953885," Despite the growing evidence for the importance of developmental experiences shaping consistent individual differences in behaviour and physiology, the role of endocrine factors underlying the development and maintenance of such differences across multiple traits, remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how an experimental manipulation of circulating glucocorticoids during early adolescence affects behavioural and physiological variation and covariation later in life in the precocial cavy (Cavia aperea). Plasma cortisol concentrations were experimentally elevated by administering cortisol via food for 3 weeks. Struggle docility, escape latency, boldness, exploration and social behaviour were then tested three times after individuals attained sexual maturity. In addition, blood samples were taken repeatedly to monitor circulating cortisol concentrations. Exogenous cortisol affected mean trait expression of plasma cortisol levels, struggle docility and escape latency. Repeatability of cortisol and escape latency was increased and repeatability of struggle docility tended to be higher (approaching significance) in treated individuals. Increased repeatability was mainly caused by an increase of among-individual variance. Correlations among docility, escape latency and cortisol were stronger in treated animals compared to control animals. These results suggest that exposure to elevated levels of cortisol during adolescence can alter animal personality traits as well as behavioural syndromes. Social and risk-taking traits showed no correlation with cortisol levels and were unaffected by the experimental manipulation, indicating behavioural modularity. Taken together, our data highlight that cortisol can have organising effects during adolescence on the development of personality traits and behavioural syndromes, adding to the increasing evidence that not only early life but also adolescence is an important sensitive period for behavioural development."
29953884," Human gaze is an important indicator of dominant and submissive behaviours related to positioning in a social hierarchy. This study investigated face gazing after a chance-determined contest and its linkage to salivary testosterone (sal-T) reactivity in athletic women. Twenty-six women athletes completed a coin-toss game on days 7 (D7), 14 (D14) and 21 (D21) of a single menstrual cycle. The game was played against an unknown opponent of similar age with the winner congratulated and rewarded with all coins. Gazing towards an opponent's head or face was timed after each contest (over 2 min) from video footage. Salivary T (sal-T) was assessed before and 15 min after these contests. The sal-T residuals increased after winning and decreased after losing on D7, D14 and D21 (p < 0.05). Gaze times were longer after a loss (M = 7.8 s) than a win (M = 3.1 s) across all days. Regression analyses revealed that the sal-T residuals and contest outcome interacted to predict gaze time. Upon deconstruction we found that, when losing a contest, a larger sal-T response (i.e., smaller decline) predicted a longer gaze (β = 1.71, p = 0.004), but no association was evident when winning (β = -0.06, p = 0.821), and these slope patterns differed (p = 0.011). In conclusion, winning a contest by chance increased sal-T responsivity and decreased opponent gaze across the menstrual cycle. A positive relationship between individual sal-T reactivity and gaze duration was observed, but only when losing. These preliminary results support suggestions that women's T may help modulate post-competition behaviours (e.g., face gazing) possibly to achieve social cohesion and cooperation."
29953883," To provide insights into the long-term impact of radical retro-pubic prostatectomy (ORRP) on LUTS which are age and prostate dependent and adversely impact quality of life. 1,995 men undergoing ORRP enrolled in a prospective longitudinal outcomes study. The American Urological Association symptom index (AUASI) was self-administered before ORRP and at pre-determined time-points after surgery. A multivariate generalized linear model was used to evaluate the association of time since ORRP with AUASS. McNemar's test and paired sample t-tests were used to assess whether the proportion of men with clinically significant LUTS (CSLUTS) defined by an American Urological Association symptom score (AUASS) >7 or mean AUASS differed significantly between the time-dependent assessments, respectively. The 15 year mean adjusted AUASS was similar to baseline (7.00 vs. 6.85, p=0.66). Throughout the 15 years of follow-up, the proportion of men with CSLUTS was lower than baseline with the exception of the 3 month and 15 year assessments. Among men with baseline clinically insignificant LUTS (CILUTS), the mean adjusted AUASS at 15 years was significantly greater than baseline (6.09 vs. 3.19, p<0.001). Among men with baseline CSLUTS, ORRP led to a significant decrease in mean adjusted AUASS between baseline and 15 years (13.26 vs. 8.67, p<0.001). ORRP favorably affects the long-term natural history of LUTS. The long-term economic and quality of life benefits of ORRP on LUTS should inform the risks and benefits of RP for treatment of localized prostate cancer."
29953882," In broiler chickens, the intense genetic selection for rapid growth has resulted in an increase in growth rate and fat deposition. Adipose tissue is now recognized as an important endocrine organ that secretes a variety of factors including adipokines. However, the expression pattern of these adipokines is unclear in chicken embryo development. In the present study, we determined the expression profile of three novel adipokines, NAMPT, RARRES2 and ADIPOQ, and their cognate receptors in metabolic tissues (liver, muscles and adipose tissue) of chicken embryo/chicks from 15 days of incubation (E15) to hatching (D0). From E15 to hatching, embryos gradually gained weight and started to develop subcutaneous adipose tissue at E15. We conducted western blot and RT-qPCR tests and found that ADIPOQ expression increased over time and was positively correlated with adipose tissue weight. In addition, NAMPT expression increased only in muscles. By using a new homemade chicken RARRES2 specific antibody we showed that RARRES2 protein levels increased specifically at hatching in adipose tissue, liver and pectoralis major and this was associated with an increase in the weight of embryo. Taken together, these results support a potential involvement of adipokines in metabolic regulation during chicken embryo development."
29953881," Lactoperoxidase (LPO) is an essential protein with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity present in mammalian milk. It imparts immunity to infants against wide range of pathogenic infections. Several in vitro studies have shown inhibition of LPO activity by pharmaceutical compounds including commonly used antibiotics such as ampicillin and gentamicin, and molecules like prednisolone, norepinephrine, etc. Prescription of such drugs to lactating mothers might have adverse health effects on infants. The aim of our study was the elucidation of the structural aspects of the inhibitory mechanism of ampicillin, gentamicin, amoxicillin, prednisolone and norepinephrine on LPO. Three dimensional structure of camel LPO (cLPO) was developed using homology modeling and used for in silico experimental studies. The Schrödinger induced fit docking along with binding affinity estimation experiments were performed. The cLPO and Ligands were prepared using Protein Preparation Wizard and Ligprep modules available in Schrodinger suite. For estimating Binding affinity Prime Molecular Mechanics with Generalized Born and Surface Area (MMGB-SA) module was used. The five drug ligands formed three to five hydrogen bonding interactions with cLPO. Amino acids Arg-231, Asp-232, Ser-370, Arg-371 and Glu-374 of cLPO were crucial for these interactions. The binding affinity values for gentamicin were highest and for norepinephrine were the lowest. This study concludes that the five drug molecules show potential ability to inhibit the LPO activity. Further, a very high sequence similarity of cLPO with human LPO imparts high significance to these conclusions in relation to human health especially in new born infants."
29953880," Wound healing is an orderly complex process involving inflammation, clotting, re-epithelialization, neovascularization and wound closure. In diabetic patients, such process is impaired and delayed, posing negative economic as well as social consequences. Diabetex, (patency# EP 0877617 A1) composed of L-alanine, d-ribose, nicotinic acid and calcium ascorbate, which was initially introduced to treat cancer is thought to have anti- diabetic effects. The present study was designed to investigate the therapeutic merit of diabetex as well as the cellular mechanisms involved in such effects and its safety profile compared to metformin in wounded diabetic rats. Sixty adult male Sprague-Dawley albino rats were randomly divided into two major groups after induction of full thickness wound; control and treated groups. Liver and kidney function test, as well as cytokines (VEGF, TGF-β, PDGF and MMP2), fasting blood sugar were measured in animal sera. Histopathological studies including hematoxyline and eosin, Masson's trichrome stains were performed on wounded tissue. Diabetex significantly improved wound healing, collagen formation, induced re-epithelialization and neovascularization. Moreover, cytokines involved in wound healing process were increased by the antidiabetic medication. Noteworthy, the drug exhibited a safe profile on liver and kidney function tests and significantly reduced fasting blood sugar. The present study offers a novel approach for treating diabetic resistant wounds with a possible more economic, safe strategy."
29953879," Proliferation of neural stem cells and differentiation of newly generated cells are crucial steps during the development of mammalian neocortex, which are able to generate suitable number of neurons and glial cells to ensure normal formation of cortex. Any disturbance in these processes leads to structural and functional abnormalities of cerebral cortex, such as epilepsy or intellectual disability. Numerous molecules involved in the development of disorders of the nervous system have been discovered in the recent years. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway has been shown to be widely involved in the corticogenesis. Recently we could show that overexpression of regulatory subunit P85 of PI3K disrupts neuronal migration. However, it remains unclear whether the regulatory subunit P85 plays a role in the proliferation of neural stem cells and differentiation of newly generated cells during mouse brain development. Here, by using in utero electroporation and immunohistochemistry, we show that overexpression of P85 inhibited proliferation of neural progenitor cells and neuronal differentiation. By using 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling, we reveal that overexpression of P85 extended the cell cycle duration, which may result in developmental retardation during mouse corticogenesis."
29953878," Obesity is a chronic and debilitating disease that has become a global epidemic. Especially severe in the Unites States, obesity currently affects almost 40% of the population. Obesity has a strong causal relationship with numerous serious comorbidities that impair quality of life, shorten life expectancy, and carry a major economic burden. Obesity has particular relevance to cardiologists because it contributes directly to several major cardiovascular diseases and, consequently, increases overall cardiovascular mortality. Multiple treatment options are available, but metabolic and bariatric surgery offers the most effective and durable treatment for obesity. Moreover, metabolic and bariatric operations alleviate and often completely eliminate numerous comorbidities, particularly type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia. With their low risk of complications and morbidity, metabolic and bariatric operations significantly improve quality of life and overall survival, particularly reducing death due to cardiovascular disease."
29953877," Nonmuscle myosin-IIA (NMHC-IIA) heavy chain phosphorylation has gained recognition as an important feature of myosin-II regulation. In previous work, we showed that phosphorylation on S1943 promotes myosin-IIA filament disassembly in vitro and enhances EGF-stimulated lamellipod extension of breast tumor cells. However, the contribution of NMHC-IIA S1943 phosphorylation to the modulation of invasive cellular behavior and metastasis has not been examined. Stable expression of phosphomimetic (S1943E) or non-phosphorylatable (S1943A) NMHC-IIA in breast cancer cells revealed that S1943 phosphorylation enhances invadopodia function, and is critical for matrix degradation in vitro and experimental metastasis in vivo. These studies demonstrate a novel link between NMHC-IIA S1943 phosphorylation, the regulation of extracellular matrix degradation and tumor cell invasion and metastasis."
29953876," Human gut microbiota play an important role in maintaining human health. Dietary fibers, i.e. prebiotics, are fermented by human gut microbiota into the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) acetate, propionate, and butyrate. SCFAs promote fat oxidation and improve metabolic health. Therefore, the prebiotic inulin might be an effective dietary strategy to improve human metabolism. We aimed to investigate the acute metabolic effects of ingesting inulin compared with digestible carbohydrates and to trace inulin-derived SCFAs using stable isotope tracer methodology. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design, 14 healthy, overweight to obese men consumed a high-fat milkshake containing A) 24 g inulin of which 0.5 g was U- Fat oxidation increased in the early postprandial phase (0-3 h), and both plasma glucose and insulin were lower after INU ingestion compared with PLA (all P<0.05). Plasma free fatty acids were higher in the early, and lower in the late postprandial period after INU ingestion. Inulin was fermented into SCFAs as indicated by higher plasma acetate concentrations after INU compared with PLA (P<0.05). In addition, we found continuous increases in plasma  Ingestion of the prebiotic inulin improves fat oxidation and promotes SCFA production in overweight to obese men. Overall, replacing digestible carbohydrates with the fermentable inulin may favor human substrate metabolism. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov under number NCT02009670."
29953875," The oomycete Aphanomyces astaci causes crayfish plague, the most important disease of European freshwater crayfish species. Presumably introduced into Europe 150 years ago with the import of North American crayfish, A. astaci is highly pathogenic to European crayfish species. Five genotypes (A, B, C, D, and E) have been defined based on random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis (RAPD-PCR) from A. astaci pure cultures. The distinction of genotypes is an essential tool to conduct molecular epidemiological studies on crayfish plague and it has been used to clarify and better understand the history and spread of this disease in Europe. Whereas RAPD-PCR requires DNA from pure culture isolates, the development of genotyping tools that can be applied to DNA extracted from clinical samples allows a much wider application of genotyping studies, including revisiting historic samples. In this study, we present a new approach that adds to currently available methods for genotyping A. astaci strains directly from clinical crayfish samples. Whole-genome sequencing of A. astaci strains representing all currently known genotypes was employed, genomic regions unique to the respective genotype identified, and a PCR-based genotyping assay designed, which focuses on the presence/absence of PCR product after amplification with the genotype-specific primers. Our diagnostic methodology was tested using DNA extracts from pure A. astaci cultures, other Aphanomyces species and additional oomycetes, samples from a recent Italian crayfish plague outbreak and additional historical samples available in the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science laboratory. The new markers were reliable for pure culture and clinical samples from a recent outbreak and successfully discriminated genotype A, B, D, and E. The marker for genotype C required an additional sequencing step of the generated PCR product to confirm genotype."
29953874," Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are revolutionizing the field of biology and metagenomic-based research. Since the volume of metagenomic data is typically very large, De novo metagenomic assembly can be effectively used to reduce the total amount of data and enhance quality of downstream analysis, such as annotation and binning. Although, there are many freely available assemblers, but selecting one suitable for a specific goal can be highly challenging. In this study, the performance of 11 well-known assemblers was evaluated in the assembly of three different metagenomes. The results obtained show that metaSPAdes is the best assembler and Megahit is a good choice for conservative assembly strategy. In addition, this research provides useful information regarding the pros and cons of each assembler and the effect of read length on assembly, thereby helping scholars to select the optimal assembler based on their objectives."
29953872," Ultrafast endocytosis generates vesicles from the plasma membrane as quickly as 50 ms in hippocampal neurons following synaptic vesicle fusion. The molecular mechanism underlying the rapid maturation of these endocytic pits is not known. Here we demonstrate that synaptojanin-1, and its partner endophilin-A, function in ultrafast endocytosis. In the absence of synaptojanin or endophilin, the membrane is rapidly invaginated, but pits do not become constricted at the base. The 5-phosphatase activity of synaptojanin is involved in formation of the neck, but 4-phosphatase is not required. Nevertheless, these pits are eventually cleaved into vesicles; within a 30-s interval, synaptic endosomes form and are resolved by clathrin-mediated budding. Then synaptojanin and endophilin function at a second step to aid with the removal of clathrin coats from the regenerated vesicles. These data together suggest that synaptojanin and endophilin can mediate membrane remodeling on a millisecond timescale during ultrafast endocytosis."
29953871," Glutamate serves as both the mammalian brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter and as a key neuromodulator to control synapse and circuit function over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. This functional diversity is decoded by two receptor families: ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). The challenges posed by the complexity and physiological importance of each of these subtypes has limited our appreciation and understanding of how these receptors work in concert. In this review, by comparing both receptor families with a focus on their crosstalk, we argue for a more holistic understanding of neural glutamate signaling."

29953864," The primary problem with the explosion of biomedical datasets is not the data, not computational resources, and not the required storage space, but the general lack of trained and skilled researchers to manipulate and analyze these data. Eliminating this problem requires development of comprehensive educational resources. Here we present a community-driven framework that enables modern, interactive teaching of data analytics in life sciences and facilitates the development of training materials. The key feature of our system is that it is not a static but a continuously improved collection of tutorials. By coupling tutorials with a web-based analysis framework, biomedical researchers can learn by performing computation themselves through a web browser without the need to install software or search for example datasets. Our ultimate goal is to expand the breadth of training materials to include fundamental statistical and data science topics and to precipitate a complete re-engineering of undergraduate and graduate curricula in life sciences. This project is accessible at https://training.galaxyproject.org."
29953863," Phenotypic image analysis is the task of recognizing variations in cell properties using microscopic image data. These variations, produced through a complex web of interactions between genes and the environment, may hold the key to uncover important biological phenomena or to understand the response to a drug candidate. Today, phenotypic analysis is rarely performed completely by hand. The abundance of high-dimensional image data produced by modern high-throughput microscopes necessitates computational solutions. Over the past decade, a number of software tools have been developed to address this need. They use statistical learning methods to infer relationships between a cell's phenotype and data from the image. In this review, we examine the strengths and weaknesses of non-commercial phenotypic image analysis software, cover recent developments in the field, identify challenges, and give a perspective on future possibilities."
29953862," Many areas of research suffer from poor reproducibility, particularly in computationally intensive domains where results rely on a series of complex methodological decisions that are not well captured by traditional publication approaches. Various guidelines have emerged for achieving reproducibility, but implementation of these practices remains difficult due to the challenge of assembling software tools plus associated libraries, connecting tools together into pipelines, and specifying parameters. Here, we discuss a suite of cutting-edge technologies that make computational reproducibility not just possible, but practical in both time and effort. This suite combines three well-tested components-a system for building highly portable packages of bioinformatics software, containerization and virtualization technologies for isolating reusable execution environments for these packages, and workflow systems that automatically orchestrate the composition of these packages for entire pipelines-to achieve an unprecedented level of computational reproducibility. We also provide a practical implementation and five recommendations to help set a typical researcher on the path to performing data analyses reproducibly."
29953861," Like tumour cells, during intraerythrocytic stage, Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes rely completely on glucose absorption from the blood circulation for energy metabolism. Glucose is taken up by glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) on human red blood cells (RBCs) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) on rodent RBCs. Blood-stage parasites grow rapidly; therefore, infected red blood cells (iRBCs) need much more glucose for energy. In previous study, WZB117 (2-fluoro-6-(m-hydroxybenzoyloxy) phenyl m-hydroxybenzoate) inhibits GLUT1 by binding the exofacial sugar-binding site and inhibits the insulin-sensitive GLUT4 with greater potency than its inhibition of either GLUT1 or GLUT3. In our study, WZB117 effectively inhibit the growth of blood-stage parasites. Mechanistically, WZB117 inhibited the activity of GLUTs and perturbed the glycolysis. Therefore, decreasing the glucose level increased the redox oxidative species (ROS) level and induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. The spleen can more easily clear apoptopic iRBCs than nonapoptotic iRBCs, effectively relieving hepatosplenomegaly. These findings provide important insights into the crucial role of glucose transporters (GLUTs) in Plasmodium glucose uptake during intra-erythrocytic stage, as the inhibition of GLUTs block Plasmodium infection during the erythrocytic stage."
29953860," The anti-lung tumor potential of 11-carbonyl-β-boswellic acid was investigated. The inhibitory effects of 11-carbonyl-β-boswellic acid on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was assessed by proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle and molecular mechanisms in NSCLC H446 cells in vitro. The results showed that the growth of H446 cells was significantly inhibited by 11-carbonyl-β-boswellic acid in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Meanwhile, 11-carbonyl-β-boswellic acid induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle G2-M phase arrest in H446 cells. Mechanistically, 11-carbonyl-β-boswellic acid could activate JNK signaling pathway, down-regulate the expression of surviving protein, and activate the cleavage of PARP, leading to marked inhibitory effect on H446 cells. These findings suggest that 11-carbonyl-β-boswellic acid may be a potential usefulness for preventing and treatment of NSCLC."
29953859," Liposarcoma is the most common soft tissue malignancy. We investigated the relationship between the expression of fibroblast growth factor -21 protein and recurrence in the liposarcoma tissues from 40 patients. The patients were divided into two groups (low/no- and high-expressing) for further survival analysis according to fibroblast growth factor -21 expression in their tumor tissue. Immunohistochemical staining showed that fibroblast growth factor -21 protein was located in the cytoplasm. The fibroblast growth factor -21 protein was significantly less expressed in liposarcoma than in normal tissue (p < 0.05). Fibroblast growth factor -21 protein expression was related to gender, but not age, cell differentiation or tumor size. The patients in the low/no fibroblast growth factor 21 expression group were more likely to relapse and die in a shorter period of time. The patients in the high-expression group had a better prognosis and less recurrence. fibroblast growth factor -21 has the potential to act both as a biomarker for liposarcoma prognosis as well as a marker for the response to therapy."
29953858," The ephrin family of membrane proteins binds Eph tyrosine kinase receptors. We have previously shown that ephrin-B3 also binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). We now show that ephrin-B3 can bind both secretory and cell associated PGs, such as agrin, collagen XVIII, Perlecan, and CD44, and indicate that such interaction with cell associated PGs involves a complex including 20 and 45 kDa proteins. Ephrin-B3 binding to HEK-293T cells is blocked by a secretory variant of CD44 (v3-v10), while over-expression of membrane associated CD44 increased ephrin-B3 binding. In addition, ephrin-B3 precipitated CD44 expressed by the oral squamous carcinoma cell line H376. Moreover, ephrin-B3 binding affinities to heparin and CD44 in solution was strong. In conclusion, we have identified secretory and cell associated PGs with high ability to bind ephrin-B3 and suggest that ephrin-B3 can bind to a protein complex organized by a membrane associated PG."
29953857," Within the extracellular domains of metastasis suppressor CD82, the large extracellular loop (EC2) has received much of the attention and its structure and function have been studied in detail. However, little attention has been given to the small extracellular loop (EC1 domain). To investigate the function role of EC1 in metastasis suppression of CD82, the peptide mimicking EC1 amino acid sequence (EC1-mP) was synthesized and its effect on cancer cells behavior was examined. Here, we reported that EC1-mP strongly inhibited cancer cell migration in vitro, attnuated the ability of cancer cells adhesion to fibronectin, and induced the apoptosis. Furthermore, the EC1-mP was showed to supprese the expressions of integrins α5 and β1, as well as decreased the phosphorylation of FAK and expression of ILK in SW620 cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that this small peptide has the functional role of CD82 intact molecule. This novel finding will improve our understanding of the mechanism by which CD82 inhibits metastasis, and suggested that EC1 mimic peptide may be a promising candidate for developing anti-metastasis drugs."
29953856," Hypofunction of the salivary gland causes several life-disrupting side effects such as dental caries, oral candidiasis, loss of taste, and swallowing disorders. No satisfactory therapy has been established to treat salivary hypofunction. Pilocarpine represents a potential treatment for dry mouth due to Sjögren's syndrome (SS). Although subjective improvement was consistently observed with pilocarpine therapy, the mechanism was unclear. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of recovery in salivation following treatment with pilocarpine. We first examined the effectiveness of pilocarpine in SS patients as quantified by the Saxon test and the visual analogue scale average. We found that salivation ability and subjective symptoms improved by continuous administration of pilocarpine. These results demonstrated that long-term medication for dry mouth patients was more effective. However, as the mechanism remained unclear, molecular biological mechanisms were analyzed based on the effects of continuous administration of pilocarpine using model mice. In the molecular biological analysis, continuous administration of pilocarpine was effective in both ICR and SS model mice. Gene and protein expression of muscarinic M3 receptor (M3R) increased in salivary glands following continuous administration of pilocarpine compared with single administration. Therefore, continuous administration of pilocarpine effectively induced M3R expression, thereby activating salivation."
29953855," We previously identified a set of the most frequently mutated cytoskeleton- and extracellular matrix-related proteins (CECMPs) in numerous cancer datasets. In this report, we used a bioinformatics approach to assess the impact of amino acid (AA) substitutions on the sensitivity of CECMPs to the ST14 protease (matriptase I), a transmembrane serine protease previously implicated in cancer development. Results indicated that AA substitutions in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) CECMPs are skewed toward increased resistance to the ST14 protease, in comparison to the wild-type peptide sequence. Furthermore, the protease resistant AA substitutions represent relatively high binding affinities to HLA class I proteins, when assessing the binding specificities using HLA class I alleles matched to the source of the mutant AA. Moreover, samples representing AA substitutions that increased protease sensitivity also represented reduced overall and disease-free survival periods for patients with glioblastoma. To assess tumor specimen immunogenicity, we identified T-cell receptor (TCR) V(D)J recombinations in GBM exome files. The overlap between ST14 protease sensitive mutant barcodes and the TCR V(D)J recombination read positive barcodes represented significantly reduced survival."
29953854," The mammalian intervertebral disc (IVD) consists of a gel-like, disordered nucleus pulposus (NP) surrounded by a highly ordered collagen structure called annulus fibrosus (AF). While this concentric array of lamellae is amply studied, its physical origin is poorly understood. The notochord is a rod-like organ located in the mid-line of the growing embryo and plays an essential role in IVD development. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of notochord development on the collagen fiber arrangement evolution in the AF. To that end, we studied the IVD development in mouse embryos and compared that to chicken embryos, which do not form the typical laminar structure around the NP. In the mouse, cross-aligned collagen arrangement of the AF forms from the sclerotome upon bulging of the notochord to become NP. By contrast, the notochord in the chick embryo swells substantially without the physical restrictions of the future vertebrae and thus do not bulge. We conclude that physical and geometrical constrictions are essential for the formation of the highly structured AF."
29953853," Programmed cell death (PCD), or apoptosis, plays essential roles in various cellular and developmental processes, and deregulation of apoptosis causes many diseases. Thus, regulation of apoptotic process is very important. Drosophila tankyrase (DTNKS) is an evolutionarily conserved protein with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase activity. In mammalian cells, tankyrases (TNKSs) have been reported to regulate cell death. To determine whether DTNKS plays function in inducing apoptosis in in vivo development, we use Drosophila as a model system and generate transgenic flies expressing DTNKS. We show that ectopic expression of DTNKS promotes caspase-dependent apoptosis and knockdown of DTNKS by RNAi dramatically alleviates apoptotic defect caused by ectopic expression of pro-apoptotic proteins hid or rpr during eye development. Moreover, our result shows that ectopic expression of DTNKS triggers the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling, which is required for DTNKS-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, our finding identified the role of DTNKS in regulating apoptosis by activating JNK signaling in Drosophila."
29953852," The adult mammalian heart doesn't regenerate after cardiomyocyte injury, which was mainly caused by the severe and persistent effects of cardiomyopathy. Recently, some studies reported that the mammalian heart can regenerate under low oxygen environment. However, the mechanism that the mammalian heart can regenerate remains unknown. Here, we used cardiac stem cells (CSCs) to be planted in serum-free medium under hypoxia environment to understand the mechanism of HIF1α/NDUFA4L2 in the regulation of hypoxia-alleviated apoptosis. Our results revealed that hypoxia can alleviated CSCs apoptosis. Hypoxia inhibited the level of cleaved-caspase3 and stimulated the expression of stabilized HIF-1α. DMOG promotes the survival of CSCs and the protein expression of NDUFA4L2. 2-ME repressed the survival of CSCs and the protein expression of NDUFA4L2. CHIP assay showed that HIF-1α regulated the survival of CSCs by augmenting the combination of HIF-1α and NDUFA4L2's HRE. Knockdown of NDUFA4L2 reversed the role of hypoxia in the survival of CSCs. Taken together, hypoxia promotes the viability of CSCs in serum-free medium by HIF-1α/NDUFA4L2 signaling pathway."
29953851," The Hippo pathway is crucial in organ size control, and its dysregulation contributes to tumorigenesis. TAZ is an essential molecule containing a WW domain in Hippo pathway and serves as transcription co-activator to modulate cell proliferation and induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition in different human cancers, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In this study, we found that TAZ"
29953850," There seems to be a clear correlation between antibodies against domain I (anti-DI) of β2Glycoprotein I and severe clinical profiles in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) patients. We investigated the clinical significance of anti-DI antibodies in a cohort of aPL carriers. One hundred and five carriers persistently positive for IgG anti-β2Glycoprotein 1 antibodies (a-β2GPI) and/or IgG anticardiolipin (aCL) and/or lupus anticoagulants (LAC) were tested for the presence of anti-DI antibodies using the QUANTA Flash® Beta2GPI-Domain I chemiluminescence immunoassay. Anti-DI antibodies were detected in 44 aPL carriers (41.9%) and they were significantly associated to triple aPL positivity (LAC plus IgG a-β2GPI plus IgG aCL antibodies). Isolated LAC and a-β2GPI antibodies were significantly associated to anti-DI negative aPL carriers. During a 82.2 month mean follow-up, ten aPL carriers (9.5%) developed a first thrombotic event so becoming APS patients. Anti-DI antibodies, triple aPL positivity, thromboembolic risk factors and autoimmune disorders significantly prevailed in carriers becoming APS. Logistic regression analysis showed that anti-DI positivity was an independent risk factor for thrombosis. Anti-DI antibody positivity can be considered a new risk factor predictive of the first thrombotic event in aPL carriers, instead, negative anti-DI may be useful to identify low-risk aPL carriers."
29953849," To determine the change in vision and retinal structure in patients with the common c.2299delG mutation in the USH2A gene in anticipation of clinical trials of therapy. Retrospective observational case series. Eighteen patients, homozygotes or compound heterozygotes with the c.2299delG mutation in USH2A, were studied with visual acuity, kinetic perimetry, dark- and light-adapted two-color static perimetry, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and autofluorescence (AF) imaging. Serial data were available for at least half of the patients depending on the parameter analyzed. The kinetics of disease progression in this specific molecular form of USH2A differed between the measured parameters. Visual acuity could remain normal for decades. Kinetic and light-adapted static perimetry across the entire visual field had similar rates of decline that were slower than those of rod-based perimetry. Horizontal OCT scans through the macula showed that IS/OS line width had a similar rate of constriction as co-localized AF imaging and cone-based light-adapted sensitivity extent. The rate of constriction of rod-based sensitivity extent across this same region was twice as rapid as that of cones. In patients with the c.2299delG mutation in USH2A, rod photoreceptors are the cells that express disease early and more aggressively than cones. Rod-based vision measurements in central or extracentral-peripheral retinal regions warrant monitoring in order to complete a clinical trial in a timely manner."
29953848," Eye toxicity is a mandatory parameter in human risk and safety evaluation for products including chemicals, pesticides, medicines and cosmetics. Historically, this endpoint has been evaluated using the Draize rabbit eye test, an in vivo model that was never formally validated. Due to advances in scientific knowledge, economic and ethical issues, non-animal methods based on mechanisms of toxicity are being developed and validated for increasing the capability of these models to predict eye toxicity. In this study, the Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) and ELISA assays were used to evaluate the inflammatory cytokine profile produced by HaCaT human keratinocytes after exposure to chemicals with different UN GHS eye toxicity classifications, aiming to stablish a correlation between inflammatory endpoints and eye toxicity (damage/irritation) potential. As a first step, cytotoxic profile of the chemicals, including 3 non-irritants and 10 eye toxicants (GHS Category 1, 2A and 2B), was evaluated after 24 h exposure using MTT assay and Inhibitory Concentration of 20% of cell viability (IC"
29953847," Therapy with betamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, is used in cases of preterm birth risk, in order to promote fetal lung maturation, and decrease neonatal mortality and morbidity. However, late reproductive disorders related to the prenatal exposure to this compound have been reported by our Laboratory, in both male and female rats. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the impact of betamethasone on postnatal reproductive development, during pre-puberty, of male offspring exposed in utero to this synthetic glucocorticoid. For this purpose, pregnant Wistar rats were allocated into two groups: Control, treated with saline, and the group treated with betamethasone at 0.1 mg/kg/day. Control and betamethasone groups were treated with intramuscular injection on gestational days 12, 13, 18 and 19, critical days of prenatal reproductive development. The treatment is associated with reduced body and organ weights, disorders in initial reproductive parameters of pre-pubertal male offspring exposed in utero to betamethasone, such as reduction of anogenital distance, alterations in histomorphometric parameters and immunostaining pattern of androgen and estrogen receptors on testicles and epididymides. Our results suggest that prenatal exposure to betamethasone potentially causes reproductive reprogramming and impairs male postnatal reproductive development. This data raise concerns about the use of betamethasone for human antenatal therapy."
29953845," Freezing nitrogen ethanol composite (FNEC) showed effective cryoablative ability for bone tumor ex vivo and in vivo comparable to liquid nitrogen (LN). We therefore wished to compare the radiant cooling damage of the surrounding tissue between FNEC and LN. The evaluation of the radiant cooling damage was demonstrated human bone xenograft transplantation (HXT) in a mouse model. Characterizations and quantifications of the damaging effects on morphologic features and apoptosis of the cryoablative surrounding bone tissue, muscle and epidermal layer of skin were compared. The radiant cooled damaging effects including epidermal rupture, hair follicle atrophy, dermis and subcutaneous crystal vacuolation of skin were significantly greater in LN than FNEC. Muscular apoptosis, structural shrinkage and bone cellular apoptosis were supposedly 15%-33% destroying degrees of LN more than FNEC. We concluded that FNEC is an innovative cryogenic material, and it could cause less cryoablative damage to surrounding normal tissue than LN. The findings might support the safety of FNEC being applied in clinical cryoablation therapy."
29953844," Primary human hepatocytes (PHH), HepaRG™, HepG2, and two sources of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived hepatocytes were characterized regarding gene expression and function of key hepatic proteins, important for the metabolic fate of drugs. The gene expression PCA analysis showed a distance between the two iPSC derived hepatocytes as well as the HepG2 and HepaRG™ cells to the three PHH donors and PHH pool, which were clustered more closely together. Correlation-based hierarchical analysis clustered HepG2 close to the stem cell derived hepatocytes both when the expression of 91 genes related to liver function or only cytochrome P450 (P450) genes were analyzed indicating the non-liver feature and a similar low P450 profile in these cell models. The specific P450 activities and the metabolic pattern of well-characterized drug substances in the cell models demonstrated that iPSC derived hepatocytes had modest levels of CYP3A and CYP2C9, while CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 were barely detectable. High expression of several extrahepatic P450s such as CYP1A1 and 1B1 detected in the stem cell derived hepatocytes may have significant effects on metabolite profiles. However, one of the iPSC derived hepatocytes demonstrated significant combined P450 and conjugating enzyme activity of certain drugs. HepaRG™ cells showed many metabolic properties similar to PHHs and will in many respects be a good model in studies of metabolic pathways and induction of drug metabolism whereas there is still ground to cover before iPSC derived hepatocytes will be seen as a substitute to PHH in drug metabolism studies."
29953843," Targeting Bcl-2 with ABT-199 (Venetoclax) shows limited single-agent activity against many cancers in both preclinical and clinical investigations. Combination therapies have attracted great attention. The principal purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of synergism between ABT-199 and paclitaxel. Moreover, we analyzed the biomarker to identify tumors which are most likely to respond to this combination. We evaluated the effect of this combination in a panel of nine cancer cell lines including cervical cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, lymphoma, leukemia and breast cancer. Combination index (CI) assay showed that four of nine call lines exhibited synergistic respond to ABT-199/paclitaxel combination due to enhanced intrinsic apoptosis. However, paclitaxel-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation impaired the synergistic effect by impeding the freeing of Bax and Bim by ABT-199 because ABT-199 cannot hit phosphorylated Bcl-2 (pBcl-2). By means of a correlation analysis of JNK level with CI value in combination with overexpressing or silencing JNK protein in cancer cells, we identified basal JNK1 level as a potential biomarker for predicting the level of pBcl-2 upon paclitaxel treatment, and thus for predicting a synergistic response. A cut-off value of 0.37 for relative JNK1 expression level was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to distinguish between synergistic and non-synergistic response cancers. A more accurate and valid cut-off value for JNK1 will be gained based on a large-scale clinical samples analysis."
29953841," Evidence Connection articles provide a clinical application of systematic reviews developed in conjunction with the American Occupational Therapy Association's (AOTA's) Evidence-Based Practice Project. In this Evidence Connection article, we describe a case report of a person who underwent a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis of his left knee. The occupational therapy assessment and intervention process both before and after surgery in the home setting is described. Findings from the systematic review (Dorsey & Bradshaw, 2017) on this topic were published in the January/February 2017 issue of the American Journal of Occupational Therapy and in AOTA's Occupational Therapy Practice Guidelines for Adults With Musculoskeletal Conditions. Each article in this series summarizes the evidence from the published reviews on a given topic and presents an application of the evidence to a related clinical case. Evidence Connection articles illustrate how the research evidence from the reviews can be used to inform and guide clinical reasoning."
29953840," Leisure is commonly treated as a means instead of an end goal of intervention. This approach, influenced by history and society's past values, does not reflect the fact that leisure is meaningful and unique to its participants and has a significant effect on their health. On the basis of the core values of the occupational therapy profession and its role in the health care system, in this article we advocate that occupational therapists should expand their focus to include leisure as a goal of intervention. Although adopting this proposed approach may not be easy, given that it involves challenges in reimbursement for services, potential competition with other health professions, and a twisting of the deep-rooted existing values of occupational therapists, we believe the proposed solutions address these concerns and shed light on how to make leisure a valued goal of intervention."
16776397," Occupational engagement is the foundation of occupational therapy. We identified perspectives of 18 occupational therapy practitioners on integrating occupation-based interventions during postacute care (PAC) rehabilitation for persons with hip fracture to identify occupational therapy's distinct contribution. We conducted six focus groups derived from a purposive national sample of occupational therapy practitioners (N = 18). A secondary analysis was conducted to analyze the transcripts for major subthemes around occupation-based interventions. Three major themes arose from practitioners' perspectives regarding the role of occupation in rehabilitation: (1) conducting an occupational profile, (2) integrating occupation-based intervention in the facility, and (3) identifying goals for occupational engagement after discharge. Challenges and strategies for integrating occupation-based interventions were also identified. Identifying practitioners' perspectives on integrating occupation into rehabilitation may inform strategies to facilitate occupation-based interventions in PAC and define occupational therapy's role in this setting."
29953838," The Cognitive Performance Test (CPT) is a standardized occupational therapy assessment that examines cognitive integration with functioning in an instrumental activities of daily living context. Conventional cognitive measures provide diagnostic utility but do not fully address the functional implications. Ninety-one veterans diagnosed with cognitive impairment were evaluated. We compared the predictive value of the CPT with the Large Allen Cognitive Level Screen (LACLS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for the need to retire from driving versus ability to pass an on-road exam. Measures were also analyzed by diagnostic classification. CPT correctly classified a mild versus major neurocognitive disorder, whereas MMSE, MoCA, and LACLS did not differentiate the groups. A CPT cutoff score of <4.7/5.6 showed 89% sensitivity for failing the road exam and 75% specificity for ability to pass. CPT discriminated functional level in neurocognitive disorders and had better predictive value for fitness to drive compared with conventional cognitive measures."
29953837," This secondary analysis quantified the psychometric properties of the Ohio Modified Arm-Motor Ability Test (OMAAT) in a sample of neurologically stable chronic stroke survivors (n = 67, 40 men; mean age 59.8 yr, standard deviation = 12.8; 42 White, 23 Black, 2 other; 92.5% right-sided lesion; 44 ischemic stroke). Findings indicate high OMAAT internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .97, ordinal α = .98, Gugiu's bootstrap reliability = .97), unidimensionality, and strong positive factor loadings for all 20 OMAAT items. Convergent validity between OMAAT and Action Research Arm Test total scores was strong (r = .90, p < .0001). The OMAAT is the first short measure of upper extremity functional limitation available to clinicians and researchers that includes an administration manual and that has been examined using nonparametric psychometrics. A detailed administration manual is provided as a supplement to this article."
29953836," Poverty is a complex problem in the United States with far-reaching consequences, often leading to a lack of food or lack of access to food. Proper nutrition and food intake are foundational to health and well-being. This participatory action research (PAR) project explored the challenges associated with living in poverty and managing food resources. Stakeholders engaged in a multiphase PAR process, which resulted in the development and implementation of a 7-wk occupation-based program. The program promotes graded learning of specific skills for managing food resources and emphasizes empowering each participant. Preliminary results indicate statistically significant improvements in participants' ability to make meals with certain food items and in perceived satisfaction and performance in self-identified activities related to food resource management. These findings support the feasibility of the program and the need for participant-driven, occupation-based approaches to improving food security."
29953835," A cross-sectional survey was conducted to determine which personal and environmental characteristics influenced diversity of participation in activities outside school for typically developing children and adolescents. Four hundred twenty-two (215 boys) typically developing Australian children (mean = 11.0 yr) completed the Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment (CAPE) and the Preferences for Activity of Children to describe their participation on five activity types: Recreational, Active Physical, Social, Self-Improvement, and Skill-Based. Linear regression analyses were conducted. Predictors of participation diversity were age and preference for Recreational ( Preference plays a key role in determining the diversity of participation in activities outside school."
29953834," We investigated associations among activity engagement (AE), number of available and relevant everyday technologies, ability to use everyday technologies, and cognitive status among older adults in an urban area. This cross-sectional study included 110 participants and used three assessments: the Frenchay Activities Index to measure AE, the Everyday Technology Use Questionnaire to measure the number of and ability to use available and relevant everyday technologies, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment to measure cognitive status. Data analyses used a one-way analysis of variance and a multiple linear regression model. The number of available and relevant everyday technologies was significantly different (p < .001) among groups that varied in level of AE. Ability to use everyday technologies did not significantly differ among groups. Cognitive status did not explain level of AE when the number of available and relevant everyday technologies was considered. Increasing the accessibility of available and relevant everyday technologies among older adults in an urban area may increase AE."
29953833," Homelessness prematurely ages people. A large subgroup of formerly homeless adults between ages 40 and 64 yr have health conditions similar to or worse than people categorized as elderly. Little is known about the impact of this group's chronic health conditions on their ability to safely function in supportive housing. Home safety visits were carried out with 25 formerly homeless adults, ages 40-64 yr, now residing in supportive housing. Participants had physical, cognitive, and mental health problems that significantly interfered with their ability to perform daily life skills, safely function in an apartment, and manage chronic health conditions. Home safety hazards included cluttered walking paths, the presence of steps, and the lack of grab bars and nonskid flooring. The homeless population would benefit from aging specialists, such as occupational therapists, who could help people to maintain and function more safely in their homes. Without such services, this population may be at risk for home safety events leading to hospitalization and mortality."
29953832," We examined the feasibility and benefit of integrating occupational therapy into a long-term services and supports (LTSS) care coordination program for aging in place. Clients referred to occupational therapy during a 16-wk trial were evaluated with the In-Home Occupational Performance Evaluation and received education on strategies for aging in place. Clients who indicated readiness for change were assisted in setting personalized goals with goal attainment scaling and received four additional occupational therapy visits. Of the program's feasibility benchmarks, 87% were met. Twenty-three clients were referred, and 16 clients were evaluated; 37.5% of those evaluated indicated readiness for change, establishing 18 goals with 100% goal attainment. Integration of occupational therapy into an LTSS care coordination program was feasible. Benefits of adding occupational therapy included a performance-based evaluation that revealed personal factors as barriers to aging in place and gave access to a client-centered service to maximize independence."
29953831," With the rapid growth of the community-dwelling older adult population, evidence-based occupational therapy interventions targeting older clients need to be effectively implemented. However, little is understood about the factors influencing effective intervention implementation into practice. We performed a scoping review to explore what strategies and factors relate to the uptake of older adult interventions into practice. Concepts from implementation science literature guided our review. Our review yielded 13 articles that met our search criteria. Study designs examined barriers, facilitators, and strategies related to the implementation of evidence-based older adult interventions into practice. Effective implementation strategies included training sessions, workshops, consultations, and outreach meetings. Our findings suggest that practitioners, administrators, and researchers should adopt strategies such as workshops, consultations, fidelity vignettes, peer mentoring, and standardized training to effectively implement research into practice with older adults."
29953830," This systematic review aimed to synthesize the effects of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy to improve performance of activities of daily living (ADLs) in community-dwelling older adults. Searches were conducted in CINAHL, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and OTseeker. Empirical studies published between 1995 and 2015 were individually screened and appraised by two reviewers. Forty-three studies met the review inclusion and exclusion criteria. Physical exercise was the most common intervention approach. Physical exercise interventions for frail older adults showed a moderate benefit, but no benefits were found for older adults without noticeable difficulty in ADLs. For older adults with difficulty in ADLs, there was a high benefit of using home-based intervention. The findings of this systematic review highlight the importance of addressing older adults' living environment in intervention to promote independence in ADLs."
29953829," We examined the effectiveness of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy to improve the performance of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) for community-dwelling older adults. We searched and examined the literature (2008 through 2016) using four electronic databases. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were critically appraised and synthesized. Analysis revealed four thematic areas: cognitive, self-management, prevention, and home-based multidisciplinary rehabilitation interventions. Strong evidence supports the use of tailored, multidisciplinary, home-based care programs to support older adults to maintain IADL improvements over time and the use of cognitive interventions to improve memory, executive function, functional status, and everyday problem solving. In addition, strong evidence indicates that tailored home-based preventive sessions were beneficial to mediate functional disability and satisfaction with performance. Evidence supports tailored interventions designed to enhance IADL performance. More studies are needed that focus on IADLs specifically and that use IADLs in their interventions."
19621072," Accidental falls among community-dwelling older adults are preventable and increase the risk of morbidity, hospitalization, and institutionalization. We updated and broadened a 2008 systematic review examining the evidence for the effectiveness of fall prevention interventions in improving fall-related outcomes, occupational performance, quality of life, and health care facility readmissions for community-dwelling older adults. We searched and analyzed literature published from 2008 to 2015 from five electronic databases. Fifty articles met the inclusion criteria and were critically appraised and synthesized-37 provided Level I; 5, Level II; and 8, Level III evidence. Analysis was organized into four intervention themes: single component, multicomponent, multifactorial, and population based. Mixed evidence was found for single-component and multifactorial interventions, strong evidence was found for multicomponent interventions, and moderate evidence was found for population-based interventions. These findings can inform the delivery and integration of fall prevention interventions from acute care to community discharge."
29953827," Because of age-related changes in sleep patterns, older adults may get less sleep than the recommended amount and experience decreased performance in daytime activities as a result. This article examines the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy addressing sleep. Thirteen Level I studies met inclusion criteria and were categorized into three themes: (1) one-to-one single-component interventions, (2) one-to-one multicomponent interventions, and (3) group multicomponent interventions. Strong evidence supports cognitive-behavioral intervention strategies for older adults that include relaxation, sleep hygiene education, problem solving, and physical exercise, among others, delivered one to one or in a group. Routine use of these interventions is recommended."
29953826," This systematic review examines the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy that address leisure engagement and social participation among community-dwelling older adults. Eleven Level I, 1 Level II, 1 Level III, and 1 Level IV studies met inclusion criteria. Included articles addressed two themes: interventions supporting social participation and interventions supporting leisure engagement. Strong evidence supports leisure education interventions to enhance leisure engagement, and moderate evidence supports chronic disease self-management programs to support leisure engagement. Mixed evidence exists for community-based group interventions and electronic gaming to support social participation. Routine use of leisure education and chronic disease self-management programs to enhance leisure engagement and selective use of community-based groups and electronic gaming to support social participation are recommended."
29953825," This systematic review examined the effectiveness of health promotion, management, and maintenance interventions within the scope of occupational therapy to improve occupational performance and quality of life (QOL) and decrease health care utilization for community-dwelling older adults. Thirty-eight articles representing 36 studies were included in the review. Articles were published 2008-2015 and described studies of participants with a mean age of 65 or older who were living in the community. Strong evidence supports the use of group, individual, or a combination of group and individual interventions to improve occupational performance. Group interventions were also effective at improving QOL. The evidence was insufficient that any of these interventions decreased health care utilization. Addressing health promotion, management, and maintenance is within the scope of occupational therapy practice and has been shown to improve occupational performance and QOL for older adults. Implications for practice and future research are discussed."
29953824," The growing number of older adults is changing the demographic landscape. Occupational therapy can better serve the older adult population by helping them maintain their functional ability, which is the ability to engage in occupations. This special issue includes both studies of interventions to evaluate and support functional ability in community-dwelling older adults and systematic reviews of such studies. This editorial highlights the six systematic reviews, which were completed in collaboration with the American Occupational Therapy Association's Evidence-Based Practice Project. These reviews compile evidence for the effectiveness of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice to promote occupational performance in community-dwelling older adults. The distinct value of occupational therapy in supporting the functional ability of community-dwelling older adults with stable or declining health is discussed using the World Health Organization's framework for healthy aging."
29953823," Ensuring that older adults are receiving quality and effective rehabilitation and skilled nursing services must be a priority to society and to the health care system, but health care policies and systems driving reimbursement continue to challenge the delivery of services. A review of the literature indicates significant problems among residents of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) that could be alleviated by meaningful occupational therapy. Research and practice in the occupational therapy community should focus on this large area of practice. Advocacy by individual practitioners-challenging themselves and others to provide more patient-centered care-can lead to changes that benefit clients, facilities, and payment systems as well as contribute to career satisfaction of occupational therapy practitioners. Occupational therapy can and should serve as catalyst for culture change in SNFs by providing meaningful interventions and opportunities that support engagement and health."

29953821," High intensity interval training (HIIT) is known to be an effective exercise training regimen to improve energy substrate metabolism and insulin sensitivity. However, the underlying mechanisms of improvement in insulin sensitivity due to HIIT have not yet been fully clarified. C1q/TNF-related protein (CTRP) 1 and CTRP9, which are adiponectin paralogs and novel adipokines, have favorable effects on energy substrate metabolism and insulin sensitivity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a single bout of HIIT on CTRP1 and CTRP9 secretions in healthy men. Eight healthy male subjects (mean ± standard error: age, 23.4 ± 1.1 years; height, 172.1 ± 1.7 cm; body mass, 68.0 ± 2.0 kg; BMI, 22.9 ± 0.5 kg/m2) participated in this study. They performed a single bout of HIIT consisted of four 30-s maximal cycling bouts with 4-min rest between bouts using a cycle ergometer. Blood samples were collected before the exercise, at 0 (immediately after the exercise), 15, 30, and 120 min after the single bout of HIIT. Serum CTRP1, CTRP9, and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosolvent assay kits. CTRP1 concentration significantly increased at 120 min after the HIIT. CTRP9 concentration also significantly increased immediately after the single bout of HIIT. In contrast, there were no significant differences in HMW adiponectin concentration before and after the acute HIIT. These findings suggest that a single bout of HIIT may stimulate CTRP1 and CTRP9 secretions in healthy men."
29953820," This study investigated the effect of consuming different commercial beverages with food ad libitum post-exercise on fluid, energy and nutrient recovery in trained females. On 4 separate occasions, 8 females (body mass [BM]: 61.8±10.7 kg; VO2max: 46.3±7.5 mL·kg-1·min-1) lost 2.0±0.3% BM cycling at ~75%VO2max before completing a 4 h recovery period with ad libitum access to one of 4 beverages: Water, Powerade® (Sports Drink), Up & Go Reduced SugarTM (Lower Sugar [LS]-MILK) or Up & Go EnergizeTM (Higher Protein [HP]-MILK). Participants also had 2×15 min opportunities to access food within the first 2 h of the recovery period. Beverage intake; total water/nutrient intake; and indicators of fluid recovery (BM, urine output, plasma osmolality [POSM]), gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance and palatability were assessed periodically. While total water intake (from food and beverage) (Water: 1918±580g; Sports Drink: 1809±338g; LS-MILK: 1458±431g; HP-MILK: 1523±472g; p=0.010) and total urine output (Water: 566±314g; Sports Drink: 459±290g; LS-MILK: 220±53g; HP-MILK: 230±117g; p=0.009) differed significantly by beverage, the quantity of ingested water retained was similar across treatments (Water: 1352±462g; Sports Drink: 1349±407g; LS-MILK: 1238±400g; HP-MILK: 1293±453g; p=0.691). Total energy intake (from food and beverage) increased in proportion to the energy density of the beverage (Water: 4129±1080kJ; Sports Drink: 5167±643kJ; LS-MILK: 6019±1925kJ; HP-MILK: 7096±2058kJ; p=0.014). When consumed voluntarily and with food, different beverages promote similar levels of fluid recovery, but alter energy/nutrient intakes. Providing access to food and understanding the longer-term dietary goals of female athletes are important considerations when recommending a recovery beverage."
29953819," HIV resistance emerging against antiretroviral drugs represents a great threat to the continued prolongation of HIV-infected patients' lifespans. Methods capable of predicting resistance susceptibility in the development of compounds are therefore in great need. Targeting the major reverse transcription residues Y181, K103 and L100, we used the biologi-cal activities of compounds against these enzymes and the wild type reverse transcriptase to create Naïve Bayes Net-works. Through this machine learning approach, we could predict with high accuracy whether a compound would be susceptible to loss of potency due to resistance. Also, we could perfectly predict retrospectively whether compounds would be susceptible to both a K103 mutant RT and a Y181 mutant RT. In the study presented here our method outper-formed a traditional molecular mechanics approach. This method should be of broad interest beyond drug discovery efforts, and serves to expand the utility of machine learning for the prediction of physical, chemical or biological prop-erties using the vast information available in the literature."
29953818, It is shown that multiple ionization energies of metal-chalcogenide clusters can be substantially reduced by adding ligands that form charge transfer complexes. We demonstrate this intriguing phenomenon by considering metal-chalcogenide clusters including cases where a cluster has a filled electronic shell with a large gap between the occupied and unoccupied states reminiscent of stable species. The studies include a Co

29953816," The aim of the present study was to formulate a nanosuspension (FA-NS) of fusidic acid (FA) to enhance its aqueous solubility and antibacterial activity. The nanosuspension was characterized using various in vitro, in silico and in vivo techniques. Size, PI and ZP of the optimized FA-NS were 265 ± 2.25 nm, 0.158 ± 0.026 and -16.9 ± 0.794 mV respectively. Molecular dynamics simulation of FA and Poloxamer-188 showed an interaction and binding energy of -74.42 kJ/mol and -49.764±1.298 kJ/mol, respectively with Van der Waals interactions playing a major role in the spontaneous binding. There was an 8-fold increase in solubility of FA in nanosuspension compared to the bare drug. MTT assays showed cell viability of 75%-100 % confirming the nontoxic nature of FA-NS. In vitro antibacterial activity revealed a 16- and 18-fold enhanced activity against Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA) respectively when compared to bare FA. Flowcytometry showed MRSA cells treated with FA-NS had almost twice the percentage of dead bacteria in the population, despite having an 8-fold lower MIC in comparison to bare drug. In vivo skin infected mice showed a 76-fold reduction in the MRSA load for FA-NS treated group compared to bare FA. These results show that nanosuspension of antibiotics can enhance their solubility and antibacterial activity simultaneously."
29953815," Baicalin (BG) is a natural glycoside with several promising therapeutic and preventive applications. However, its pharmaceutical potential is compromised by its poor water-solubility, complex oral absorption kinetics and low bioavailability. In this work BG was incorporated in a series of chitosan (Ch)/ glycerophosphate (GP)-based thermosensitive hydrogel formulations to improve its water-solubility and control its release profile. Molecular interactions between BG and GP were investigated using Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and the ability of GP to enhance the water-solubility of BG was studied in different release media. Drug-loaded Ch/GP hydrogels were prepared and characterized for their gelation time, swelling ratio, rheological properties in addition to surface and internal microstructure. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) were incorporated in the formulations at different ratios to study their effect on modulating the sol-gel behavior and the in vitro drug release. In vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were carried out using a rabbit model to study the ability of drug-loaded Ch/GP thermosensitive hydrogels to control the absorption rate and improve the bioavailability of BG. Results showed that the solubility of BG was enhanced in presence of GP while the incorporation of PEG and/or HPMC had an impact on gelation time, rheological behavior and rate of drug release in vitro. PK results obtained following buccal application of drug-loaded Ch/GP thermosensitive hydrogels to rabbits showed that the rate of BG absorption was controlled and the in vivo bioavailability was increased by 330% relative to BG aqueous oral suspension. The proposed Ch/GP thermosensitive hydrogel is an easily modifiable delivery platform that is not only capable of improving the solubility and bioavailability of BG following buccal administration but also can be suited for various local and injectable therapeutic applications."
29953814," Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), largely composed of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), is currently one of the most intractable environmental problems in China. As crucial precursors for SOA, understanding the formation propensity of various volatile organic compound (VOC) species and sources is useful for pollution control. In this work, we estimated the SOA formation potential (SOAP) of anthropogenic VOC emissions based on an improved speciated VOC emission inventory, and investigated its distribution in China. According to our estimates, toluene had the largest SOAP, followed by n-dodecane, m/p-xylene, styrene, n-decane, and n-undecane, while passenger cars, chemical fiber manufacturing, asphalt paving, and building coating were the top five SOAP-contributing sources nationwide. The spatial distribution of SOAP in China shows a distinct pattern of high values in the southeast and low values in the northwest. Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surroundings, the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Sichuan-Chongqing District were found to have the highest SOAP, particularly in urban areas. The major SOAP-contributing species and sources differed among these regions, which was attributed to local industrial and energy structures. Our results suggest that to mitigate PM2.5 pollution in China, more efficient SOAP-based control measures should be implemented instead of current emissions-based policies, and VOC control strategies should be adapted to local conditions."
29953813," A simple method to rapidly customize and to also mass produce oral dosage forms is arguably a current bottleneck in the development of modern personalized medicine. Specifically, delayed-release mechanisms with well-controlled dosage profiles for combinations of traditional Chinese herbal extracts and Western medications are not well established. Herein, we demonstrate a novel multi-drug loaded membrane sandwich with structures infused with ibuprofen (IBU) and ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide (GLP) using electrohydrodynamic (EHD) 3D printing and electrospinning techniques. The resulting flexible membrane consists of micro-scaled, multi-layered cellulose acetate (CA) membranes loaded with IBU in either the shape of concentric squares or circles, as the top and bottom layer of a sandwich structure. In between the CA-IBU layers are randomly electrospun (ES) polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) layers loaded with GLP. The complete fibrous membrane sandwich can be folded and embedded into a 0-size capsule to achieve oral compliance. Simulated in vitro testing of gastric and intestinal fluids demonstrated a triphasic release profile. There was an immediate release of GLP after gastric juices dissolved the capsule shell and the PVP, followed by the short-term release of 60% of the IBU within an hour afterwards, and the remaining IBU was sustained released following a Fickian diffusion profile. In summary, this multi-drug (both hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic) oral system with precision-designed structures should enable personalized therapeutic dosing."
29953812," There is an urgent need for strategies to combat dengue and other emerging viral infections. We reported that cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK), a cellular regulator of the clathrin-associated host adaptor proteins AP-1 and AP-2, regulates intracellular trafficking of multiple unrelated RNA viruses during early and late stages of the viral lifecycle. We also reported the discovery of potent, selective GAK inhibitors based on an isothiazolo[4,3-b]pyridine scaffold, albeit with moderate antiviral activity. Here, we describe our efforts leading to the discovery of novel isothiazolo[4,3-b]pyridines that maintain high GAK affinity and selectivity. These compounds demonstrate improved in vitro activity against dengue virus, including in human primary dendritic cells, and efficacy against the unrelated Ebola and chikungunya viruses. Moreover, inhibition of GAK activity was validated as an important mechanism of antiviral action of these compounds. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of a GAK-targeted broad-spectrum approach for combating currently untreatable emerging viral infections."
29953811," Cell aggregates hold significant therapeutic promise for in vitro cell analysis, ex vivo tissue models, and in vivo cell therapy and tissue engineering. Traditional methods of making cell aggregates require long incubation times and can only produce 3D-spheroid-shaped aggregates. We propose a novel method of making cell aggregates of diverse sizes and shapes using lipid-conjugated heparin. Shaking the cell suspension containing a small amount of lipid-conjugated heparin for approximately 30 min produced cell aggregates. This approach can be applied to any cell type, including stem cells, fibroblast cells, and T lymphocytes. The shape of biocompatible templates could modulate the shape of cell aggregates. In addition to layered, multi-compartmental cell aggregates on template, template-free, tube-shaped cell aggregates could also be made. The cell aggregates formed were alive and maintained biological activities."
29953810," We investigate the performance of a class of compact and systematically improvable Jastrow-Slater wave functions for the efficient and accurate computation of structural properties, where the determinantal component is expanded with a perturbatively selected configuration interaction scheme (CIPSI). We concurrently optimize the molecular ground-state geometry and full wave function -- Jastrow factor, orbitals, and configuration interaction coefficients-- in variational Monte Carlo (VMC) for the prototypical case of 1,3-trans-butadiene, a small yet theoretically challenging $\pi$-conjugated system. We find that the CIPSI selection outperforms the conventional scheme of correlating orbitals within active spaces chosen by chemical intuition: it gives significantly better variational and diffusion Monte Carlo energies for all but the smallest expansions, and much smoother convergence of the geometry with the number of determinants. In particular, the optimal bond lengths and bond-length alternation of butadiene are converged to better than one m\AA\ with just a few thousand determinants, to values very close to the corresponding CCSD(T) results. The combination of CIPSI expansion and VMC optimization represents an affordable tool for the determination of accurate ground-state geometries in quantum Monte Carlo."
29953809," Using knowledge- and structure-based approaches, we designed and synthesized reversible chemical probes that simultaneously inhibit the activity of two epigenetic targets, histone 3 lysine 9 methyltransferase (G9a) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), at nanomolar ranges. Enzymatic competition assays confirmed our design strategy: substrate competitive inhibitors. Next, an initial exploration around our hit 11 was pursued to identify an adequate tool compound for in vivo testing. In vitro treatment of different hematological neoplasia cell lines led to the identification of molecules with clear anti-proliferative efficacies (GI50 values in the nanomolar range). Based on epigenetic functional cellular responses (levels of lysine 9 methylation and 5-methylcytosine), an acceptable therapeutic window (around 1 log unit) and a suitable pharmacokinetic profile, 12 was selected for in vivo proof-of-concept (ref 53). Herein, 12 achieved a significant in vivo efficacy: 70% overall tumor growth inhibition of a human AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) xenograft in a mouse model."
29953808," Cancer cells rely on the chaperone, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), for survival and proliferation. Recently, benzothiazole-rhodacyanines have been shown to bind an allosteric site on Hsp70, interrupting its binding to nucleotide-exchange factors (NEFs) and promoting cell death in breast cancer cell lines. However, proof-of-concept molecules, such as JG-98, have relatively modest potency (EC50 ~0.7 to 0.4 µM) and are rapidly metabolized in animals. Here, we explored this chemical series through structure- and property-based design of ~300 analogs, showing that the most potent had >10-fold improved EC50 values (~0.05 to 0.03 µM) against two breast cancer cells. Biomarkers and whole genome CRISPRi screens confirmed members of the Hsp70 family as cellular targets. Based on these results, JG-231 was found to reduce tumor burden in an MDA-MB-231 xenograft model (4 mg/kg; i.p.). Together, these studies support the hypothesis that Hsp70 may be a promising target for anti-cancer therapeutics."
29953752," Skeletal muscle index (SMI) and the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score are useful for evaluating nutritional status, which is closely associated with cancer prognosis. This study compared the prognostic value of these indicators in patients with gastric cancer (GC) after radical gastrectomy (RG). We retrospectively enrolled 532 patients between 2010 and 2011. SMI was measured via CT images to determine low SMI. The CONUT score was calculated based on serum albumin, total lymphocyte count, and cholesterol. Patients were grouped according to SMI and the CONUT score based on previous research. Spearman's correlation coefficient, the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression were used. There was no significant correlation between SMI and the CONUT score. Five-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with low SMI were significantly worse than those in patients with high SMI (P < .001). The normal nutrition group had better OS and RFS than did the light and moderate or severe malnutrition groups (P < .05), but the OS and RFS were not significantly different between the light and moderate or severe malnutrition groups (P = .726). Univariate analysis showed that SMI and the CONUT score were associated with OS and RFS, but only SMI remained prognostic in multivariate analysis. Preoperative SMI based on CT images is a more objective predictor than the CONUT score of long-term survival in GC after RG, but this finding must be confirmed by prospective trials."
29953751," To simplify the previously published Nottingham 12-year risk prediction model for knee osteoarthritis (OA) and examine whether it can be used to predict the 40-year risk of knee OA in young men. We included 40 118 men aged 18 undergoing military conscription in Sweden 1969-70. Diagnostic OA codes were obtained from the Swedish National Patient Register 1987-2010. The original Nottingham model included predictors age, sex, body mass index (BMI), knee injury, occupational risk and family history of OA with area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC)=0.70, 95% CI=0.61-0.79 in the model development sample and AUC=0.60, 95% CI=0.58-0.63 in an external validation sample. We used predictors available in adolescence only (age, BMI and knee injury) and studied the discrimination of the simplified model using AUC in our sample. The AUC-statistic of the modified knee OA model to predict 40-year risk was 0.60 (95% CI=0.59-0.61). Hence, using the reduced model; an 18-year old man having a BMI of 30 and a knee injury would have a three times higher risk of developing knee OA within 40 years compared to a similarly aged man having a BMI of 25 and no knee injury (predicted risks 22% and 7%, respectively). The individual and population 40-year risk of knee OA is predictable in 18-year olds from a few easily measured covariates with moderate discrimination. The discrimination of this simplified model based on data available in adolescence was comparable to that of the full Nottingham model in middle age. This article is protected by copyright.

29953750," This study examined the association between Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) promoter polymorphisms and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and MIF's role in a murine model of granulomatous vasculitis. The human study involved 1077 patients with GPA and controls. Genotyping for the MIF -794 CATT The percentage of individuals carrying >5 CATT repeats in each MIF allele (high MIF expressers) was 60.9% in patients with GPA and 53.7% in controls (adjusted p=0.049). Human MIF gene expression increased proportionally by CATT-length in response to granulomatous stimulation. Mif lung-Tg2.1 mice exhibited more pulmonary granulomas than WT, which in turn showed more granulomas than Mif-KO. A significantly higher percentage of Mif lung-Tg2.1 mice died when injected with CAG when compared to Mif-KO or WT, and anti-MIF protected against lethal disease. MIF-dependent neutrophil/macrophage chemokines were elevated in the bronchoalveolar lavage or plasma of Mif lung-Tg2.1 mice. Patients with GPA have an increased frequency of high-expression MIF CATT alleles. Higher MIF expression increased mortality and pulmonary granulomas while anti-MIF protected mice from lethal disease. MIF blockade in high genotypic MIF expressers may offer a selective pharmacologic therapy for GPA. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
29953749," The pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has not been fully clarified. Anti-αvβ3 integrin autoantibody is detected in chronic ITP patients, but its contribution to ITP is still unclear. To clarify the potential role of anti-αvβ3 integrin autoantibody in chronic ITP and the related mechanism. Relationship between levels of anti-αvβ3 autoantibody and platelets in chronic ITP patients was evaluated. Influence of anti-αvβ3 antibody on megakaryocytes (MKs) survival, differentiation, migration and adhesion was assessed, and the associated signal pathways were investigated. Platelet recovery and MKs distribution were observed in ITP mouse model pretreated with different antibodies. In this study, we showed that the anti-αvβ3 autoantibody usually coexists with anti-αIIbβ3 autoantibody in chronic ITP patients, and patients with both autoantibodies have lower platelets. In vitro studies, we showed that the anti-αvβ3 antibody had no significant effect on the survival and proliferation of MKs, while it decreased formations of proplatelet significantly. Anti-αvβ3 antibody impeded SDF-1 mediated migration and inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT. Anti-αvβ3 antibody significantly inhibited MKs adhesion to ECs and Fg. The phosphorylation of FAK and SRC induced by adhesion was inhibited when MKs were pretreated with anti-αvβ3 antibody. In vivo studies, we showed that injection with anti-α These findings demonstrate that the autoantibody against integrin α"
29953748," Visual analog scale patient global assessments (PGA-VAS) are widely used in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) practice and research. Low PGA-VAS scores are required for remission. Vulnerable patients may have difficulty completing the PGA-VAS. There is limited information about both patients' perceptions of PGA-VAS and how patients score VAS model disease states. The objective of this study is to understand vulnerable patients' perspectives regarding PGA-VAS and model disease states. We enrolled RA patients at Denver Health (n=300). Subjects completed the disease activity score-28 (DAS28-PGA-VAS) and Multidimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ-PGA-VAS) and completed a questionnaire regarding these PGA-VAS. Subjects also scored remission, mild, moderate and severe model disease states by VAS. We performed analyses using summary statistics, linear, and logistic regression. Outcomes included: whether subjects found the PGA-VAS confusing, if subjects' responses to the model disease states followed a natural progression (remission<mild<moderate<severe), and whether responses to the remission model would meet Boolean and simplified disease activity index (SDAI)-based remission criteria. Approximately 40% of subjects found the PGA-VAS confusing; lower health literacy (HL) and depressive symptoms were associated with finding them confusing. Less than 25% of subjects ranked the model disease states with natural progression and the remission model at the threshold for remission; higher HL and income were associated with accomplishing these objectives. Vulnerable patients perceive difficulty with PGA-VAS, and do not reliably rate model disease state VAS. These patients are potentially at risk for disease activity misclassification because of literacy and other barriers in completing VAS. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
29953747," The mechanism of upper tract recurrence after local excision of bladder cancer remains unknown. This study was designed to identify risk factors for upper tract urothelial recurrence following local tumor excision of bladder cancer. To identify 76 597 bladder cancer patients, comprising 76 537 nonrecurrence and 60 recurrence patients, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used. Kaplan-Meier analysis and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to determine the risk factors. Compared with the nonrecurrence group, the recurrence group was associated with older age, higher grade, high T stage, and higher proportional squamous cell carcinomas. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that age, grades III and IV, T stage, and pathology were significantly associated with worse upper tract urothelial recurrence (UTUR) survival. However, after adjusting for prognostic factors, grade was no longer an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis. This study demonstrates that clinical prognosis of UTUR after local bladder tumor excision has significant independent risk factors that include age ≥60 years, T1 and T2 stage, and squamous cell carcinoma, and will require more careful consideration during follow-up."
29953746," Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is the treatment of choice for high-risk primary basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and recurrent BCC of the head and neck, showing fewer recurrences compared with surgical excision (SE). The objectives of this study were to determine the recurrence rate of head and neck BCC after MMS and to develop a prediction model with significant risk factors for recurrence. A retrospective study of patient records. All BCCs treated with MMS between 1 January 1995 and 1 July 2013 at the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) were selected retrospectively. Recorded parameters were patient characteristics, tumour size, tumour location, histopathological subtype, previous treatment, the number of stages until microscopic clearance, defect size, adverse events, follow-up time and recurrence after MMS. The study covered 1021 MMS operations conducted on primary BCCs (57.4%), residual BCCs (25.6%) and recurrent BCCs (17.0%). The median follow-up time was 54.0 months (ranging from 1 to 221 months). The 5-year cumulative probability of recurrence was 3.3%: 2.6% for primary BCCs, 5.4% for residual BCCs and 2.9% for recurrent BCCs. An aggressive histopathological subtype, residual BCCs and recurrent BCCs were significant risk factors for predicting a higher risk of recurrence after MMS. This large-scale retrospective study showed low recurrence rates after MMS for primary and recurrent BCCs. Residual BCCs treated with MMS had relatively higher recurrence rates. The risk of recurrence for MMS-treated residual aggressive BCCs was more than four times higher than that for primary non-aggressive BCCs. This article is protected by copyright.

29953745," Muscle co-activation has been shown to be elevated in individuals with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) during gait. Comparisons of muscle co-activation across different activities of daily living such as stair negotiation have yet to be explored. The aim of the study was to explore muscle co-activation across different activities of daily living in patients with KOA. Muscle co-activation was assessed in 77 symptomatic KOA participants (age 62.5±8.1years; body mass index 29.4±9.0kg/m Muscle co-activation was highest during stair ascent. When comparing muscle combinations within the same activity correlations ranged from r=0.003-0.897 of which 80% of combinations were significant. Between activities muscle co-activation was significantly different (P<0.05). Medial:lateral muscle co-activation was higher than hamstrings:quadriceps across activities. Two muscle co-activation strategies were observed during activities of daily living in patients with KOA to maintain stability. Muscle co-activation was higher during more challenging activities, particularly when the joint is accepting load. Medial:lateral muscle co-activation was higher than hamstrings:quadriceps whereby medial:lateral co-activation is thought to be a stabilisation mechanism whilst hamstrings:quadriceps responds to knee flexion moments, suggesting different muscle combinations may have different roles in responding to joint demand.

29953744," Rheumatology has been a less attractive career choice than other internal medicine (IM) subspecialties. Recent fellowship ""Match"" data suggested this may have changed. We therefore evaluated the current attractiveness of rheumatology and compared it with other medical subspecialties. Data from the ""Match"" from 2008 - 2017, the 2015 American College of Rheumatology workforce study, and Medscape physician salaries from 2010 - 2017 were used to determine annual numbers of fellowship applicants, availability of positions, and post-fellowship salary trends. Data from 2008 - 2013 were compared with 2014 - 2017, and rheumatology with other IM subspecialties. The total number of annual applicants to rheumatology for 2008 - 2013 decreased from 251 to 244, a 3% decrease (average annual percentage change of -1.9% ± 2.6 [mean ± SEM]). However, for 2014 - 2017 annual rheumatology applications increased from 230 to 332, a 44% increase (average annual percentage change of 20.7% ± 10.5 [p = 0.03]). Other non-procedural and procedural IM subspecialties did not exhibit such an increase. For rheumatology the ratio of annual applicants to positions (p = 0.02) and percentage of US medical graduates applying (p = 0.03) were statistically significantly increased, while mean post-fellowship salary also rose. These observations suggest that rheumatology has become more attractive since 2014. We speculate that the increasing popularity of the field is multifactorial, likely reflecting lifestyle, job satisfaction and availability, influences of mentors, and other elements. This is a salutary and potentially exciting opportunity for rheumatology that should be exploited. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

29953742," To explore associations of joint hypermobility (a condition where range of motion is greater than normal) with ankle and foot radiographic osteoarthritis and symptoms in a large community-based cohort of African American and Caucasian adults 55-94 years old. Ankle and foot radiographs and joint hypermobility data (Beighton Criteria) were available for 848 participants (2003-2010) in this cross-sectional study. General joint hypermobility was defined as a Beighton score ≥4 (range 0-9); knee hypermobility was defined as hyperextension of at least one knee. Standing anteroposterior and lateral foot radiographs were read with standard atlases for Kellgren-Lawrence grade, osteophytes and joint space narrowing at the tibiotalar joint and for osteophytes and joint space narrowing to define osteoarthritis at five foot joints. Ankle or foot symptoms were self-reported. Separate person-based logistic regression models were used to estimate associations of ankle and foot osteoarthritis and symptom outcomes with hypermobility measures, adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, and history of ankle/foot injury. This sample was: 68% women and 33% African American; mean age=71 years; mean body mass index=31 kg/m Knee joint hypermobility may be related to talonavicular osteoarthritis and to ankle and foot symptoms.

29953741," To identify behavioral health provider perspectives on gaps in mental health care for youth with rheumatologic conditions. Social workers (n=34) and psychologists (n=8) at pediatric rheumatology centers in the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) completed an online survey assessing current practices and mental health care needs of youth with rheumatologic conditions. Responses were compared to a published survey of CARRA rheumatologists (n=119). Thematic analysis of 20 semi-structured interviews with behavioral health providers was performed. One third of CARRA centers (n=100) had no affiliated social worker or psychologist. Only one behavioral health provider reported current universal mental health screening at their rheumatology clinic, yet routine depression screening was supported by >85% of behavioral health providers and rheumatologists. Support for anxiety screening was higher among behavioral health providers (90% vs 65%, p<0.01). Interviews illustrated a need for interventions addressing illness-related anxiety, adjustment/coping/distress, transition, parent/caregiver mental health, and peer support. Limited resources, lack of protocols, and patient cost/time burden were the most frequent barriers to intervention. Inadequate follow-up of mental health referrals was indicated by 52%. More behavioral health providers than rheumatologists favored mental health services in rheumatology settings (55% vs 19%, p<0.01). Only 7 social workers (21%) provided counseling/therapy, and interviews indicated their perceived under-utilization for these services.

29953740," Although commonly associated with obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is also present in the lean population representing a unique disease phenotype. Affecting 25% of the world's population, NAFLD is associated with increased mortality especially when progressed to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, no approved pharmacological treatments exist. Current research focuses mainly on NASH associated with obesity, leaving the effectiveness of promising treatments in lean NASH virtually unknown. This study therefore aims to evaluate the effect of liraglutide (glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue) and dietary intervention, alone and in combination, in guinea pigs with non-obese NASH. Following 20 weeks of high-fat feeding (20% fat, 15% sucrose, 0.35% cholesterol), 40 female guinea pigs were block-randomized based on weight into four groups receiving one of four treatments for four weeks: continued high-fat diet (HF, control), high-fat diet and liraglutide treatment (HFL), chow diet (4% fat, 0% sucrose, 0% cholesterol; HFC) or chow diet and liraglutide treatment (HFCL). High-fat feeding induced NASH with severe fibrosis. Liraglutide decreased inflammation (p<0.05) and hepatocyte ballooning (p<0.05), while increasing hepatic α-tocopherol (p=0.0154). Dietary intervention did not improve liver histopathology significantly, but decreased liver weight (p=0.004), plasma total cholesterol (p=0.0175), LDL-cholesterol (p=0.0063), VLDL-cholesterol (p=0.0034), hepatic cholesterol (p<0.0001) and increased hepatic vitamin C (p=0.0099). Combined liraglutide and dietary intervention, induced a rapid weight loss, necessitating periodical liraglutide dose adjustment/discontinuation, limiting the strength of the findings from this group. Collectively, this pre-clinical study supports the beneficial effect of liraglutide on NASH and extend this notion to lean NASH. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
29953739," To explore the associations between microvascular abnormalities assessed by nailfold capillaroscopy (NFC) and pulmonary and cardiac involvement in patients with juvenile dermatomyositis (DM) assessed after medium- to long-term follow-up. Fifty-eight juvenile DM patients were examined mean 17.0 (SD 10.6) years after symptom onset. Nailfold capillary density (NCD) and neovascular pattern (defined as scleroderma active or late pattern) were analysed blinded to clinical data. Pulmonary involvement was assessed by pulmonary function tests (PFT) including spirometry, diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and body plethysmography; also high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed. Cardiac involvement was assessed by electrocardiography, Holter monitoring (heart rate variability) and echocardiography. Patients with low NCD (<6 capillaries/mm) (n=21), compared to patients with normal NCD (≥ 6 capillaries/mm) (n=37), presented lower forced vital capacity (89.7 vs 98.5% of predicted), total lung capacity (87.8 vs 94.5% of predicted) and more often low DLCO (15/21 (71%) vs 14/37 (38%)); all p's<0.05. HRCT assessed airways disease was more frequent in the low NCD group (6/21 (30%) vs 3/37 (8%); p=0.034). No associations were found between i) NCD and cardiac parameters or ii) neovascular pattern and pulmonary or cardiac parameters. In juvenile DM patients, low NCD was associated with lung involvement, which was mostly subclinical. No significant associations with cardiac involvement were found. These results shed light on possible mechanisms underlying organ involvement, but further and preferably larger studies are needed to identify NCD as a potential biomarker for lung and cardiac involvement in juvenile DM.

29953738, The incidence and mortality rate of urological cancers is increasing yearly. Niclosamide has been repurposed as an anti-cancer drug in recent years. Synthesized derivative of niclosamide was testified for its anti-cancer activity in urological cancers. MTT assay was used to measure the cytotoxicity effect of niclosamide and its derivatives in urological cancer cell lines. Migratory ability was monitored by scratch migration assay. Apoptosis and cell cycle changes were analyzed by annexin V and PI staining. The apoptosis-related signal proteins were evaluated by western blotting. T24 had the best drug sensitivity with the lowest IC
29953737," Recent studies imply that glial activation plays a role in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and major depression. We previously demonstrated that Gunn rats with hyperbilirubinemia show congenital gliosis and schizophrenia-like behavior. As it has been suggested that major depression involves glial activation associated with neuroinflammation, we examined whether Gunn rats show depression-like behavior using the forced swimming test (FST) and the tail suspension test (TST). In addition, we quantitatively evaluated both microgliosis and astrogliosis in the hippocampus of Gunn rats using immunohistochemistry analysis of the microglial marker ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule (Iba) 1 and the astrocytic marker S100B. Both the FST and TST showed that immobility time of Gunn rats was significantly longer than that of normal control Wistar rats, indicating that Gunn rats are somewhat helpless, a sign of depression-like behavior. In the quantification of immunohistochemical analysis, Iba1immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus (DG), cornu ammonis (CA) 1, and CA3 and the number of Iba1-positive cells in the CA1 and CA3 were significantly increased in Gunn rats compared to Wistar rats. S100B immunoreactivity in the DG, CA1, and CA3 and the number of S100B-positive cells in the DG and CA3 were significantly increased in Gunn rats compared to Wistar rats. Our findings suggest that both microglia and astrocyte are activated in Gunn rats and their learned helplessness could be related to glial activation."
29953736," Several comorbidities have recently been shown to affect risk of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia (FN). Here, we evaluated the added predictive value of these comorbidities beyond established FN risk factors. A retrospective cohort study was conducted among adult patients diagnosed with cancer and treated with chemotherapy at Kaiser Permanente Southern California between 2000 and 2009. The study cohort was equally split into training and validation datasets to develop and evaluate the performance of FN risk prediction models in the first chemotherapy cycle. A reference model was developed based on the model proposed by Lyman et al (Cancer 2011;117:1917). A new model was developed by incorporating the newly identified comorbidities such as rheumatoid conditions and thyroid disorders into the reference model. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC), risk reclassification, and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were used to evaluate the potential improvement of FN risk prediction by incorporating comorbidities. A total of 15 279 patients were included; 4.2% experienced FN in the first chemotherapy cycle. Including comorbidities in FN risk prediction did not improve AUROCC (reference model 0.71 vs new model 0.72). A significant improvement in individual-level FN risk prediction was indicated by IDI (P = .02). However, significant improvement in risk reclassification was not observed overall (although 6% of all patients were more accurately classified for their FN risk level, 5% were less accurately classified) or when examining predicted FN risk among patients who did and did not develop FN. Incorporating several new comorbidities into FN prediction led to improved FN risk prediction in the first chemotherapy cycle, although the observed improvements were small and might not be clinically relevant."
29953735," Interest in implementing green chemistry principles in analytical chemistry has grown dramatically in the past few years. The solvents used have the major influence on the greenness of the method. Most conventional high-performance liquid chromatography methods employed utilize solvents that are ""hazardous for the environment"". In the present study, two-factor three-level response surface design was exploited to develop eco-friendly chromatographic methods for two different mixtures. The first one was Atorvastatin and Amlodipine and the second one was Amlodipine, Perindopril, and Indapamide. As it is non-toxic to the environment, ethanol was used as the organic modifier in the mobile phase. The separation of the first mixture was attained using phosphate buffer (pH 7)/ethanol (42:58 v/v), and the second mixture was fully resolved using phosphate buffer (pH 5)/ethanol (40:60 v/v). The use of high-performance liquid chromatography allows excellent resolution in a short run time, hence, less waste was produced. The greenness of the developed methods was assessed by two evaluation tools, namely, NEMI and analytical eco-scale, and found to be excellent green analytical methods. Moreover, the developed methods were compared with other reported methods regarding accuracy and greenness and were found to be perfect alternatives to reported methods for separation and quantification of the mixtures.

29953733," In this proof-of-concept study, we sought to evaluate whether a value clarification tool enabling patients to view a set of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment preference phenotypes could be used to support shared decision-making (SDM) at the point-of-care. We conducted a pre-post test study. All English-speaking RA patients presenting to their scheduled outpatient visits were asked to participate. Visits for patients with active RA were transcribed. SDM components were measured using a quantitative coding scheme based on an established model of SDM. Forty-six visits were included in the pre-test and 40 in the post-test phase. Providers offered more DMARDs (two or more) in the post-test visits (60%) compared to the pre-test visits (47.8%). Overall, more patients vocalized their values and/or preferences in the post-test visits compared to the pre-test visits for treatment escalation decisions including choice of one new DMARD (90.9% versus 56.3%), two or more new DMARDs (95.8% versus 86.4%), as well as prednisone (87.5% versus 66.7%). Providers were also more likely to base their recommendations on patients' values and/or preferences in the post-test (100% of six visits) than pre-test (64.3% of 14 visits) phase during visits in which a recommendation was made. The average (SD) length of the visit was 29.9 (11.6) minutes and 25.1 (10.7) minutes in the pre- and post-test phases respectively. This study provides an early indication that a value clarification tool allowing patients to consider a set of preference phenotypes can support SDM at the point-of-care without extending visit time.

29953730," Branched chain keto acid decarboxylases (KDCs) are a class of enzymes that catalyze the decarboxylation of α-keto acids. It is a key enzyme for production of higher alcohols in vivo and in vitro. However, the two most active KDCs (KivD and KdcA) have only moderate thermostability (<55 °C) hindering the production of the alcohols at high temperatures. In this study, structure-guided engineering toward improved thermostability of KdcA is outlined. Several strategies such as, stabilization of the catalytic center, surface engineering, and optimization of dimer interactions were applied. With 7 point mutations, our mutant (7M.D) showed an increase of T501h by 14.8 °C without compromising its substrate specificity. 7M.D exhibited >400-fold improvement of half-life at 70 °C and >600-fold increase in process stability in the presence of 4 % isobutanol at 50 °C. 7M.D is more promising for the production of higher alcohols in thermophiles (>65 °C) as well as in cell-free applications."
29953729," To determine the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of the 22-item Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) in individuals undergoing medical management for their chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Prospective observational study. Academic, tertiary care center. A total of 247 adults undergoing medical management for CRS. At enrollment, participants completed a SNOT-22. At a subsequent follow-up visit, two to twelve months after enrollment, participants also completed a SNOT-22. At follow-up, participants also rated the change in their sinus symptoms and general health as ""Much worse"", ""A little worse"", ""About the same"", ""A little better"" or ""Much better"" compared to enrollment; these two questions were used as sinus symptom and general health anchor questions, respectively. The SNOT-22 MCID was calculated using distribution-based, anchor-based, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve-based methods. Using the distribution-based method, the SNOT-22 MCID was 11.6. Using the sinus symptom anchor question, the SNOT-22 MCID was 10.5; applying the ROC method to the sinus symptom anchor yielded an MCID of 12.5. In comparison, using the general health anchor question, the SNOT-22 MCID was 8.3; applying the ROC method to the sinus symptom anchor yielded an MCID of 17.5. In all cases, the calculated MCID had a sensitivity of approximately 50-60% and specificity of approximately 80-90%. Based on our results, we propose a SNOT-22 MCID of 12 in medically managed CRS patients. The MCID, while specific, was not sensitive for identifying CRS patients experiencing a noticeable improvement in sinus symptoms or general health. This article is protected by copyright.

29953728," Tumor suppressor protein p53 aggregates in hypoxic core of solid tumor. The C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein CHIP displays chaperone as well as E3 ligase activities in both stabilizing and degrading wild type and mutant p53. In this study we have discovered that CHIP selectively degrades p53 aggregating mutants under both normal and hypoxic condition. Silencing of CHIP alleviates degradation of aggregating p53 mutants both in normoxia and hypoxia whereas CHIP silencing has no significant effect on the level of non aggregating mutants. Although both U-box and TPR domains of CHIP are responsible for p53 degradation, U-Box selectively binds to p53 aggregating mutants whereas TPR domain interacts with p53 non-aggregating mutants. The degradation of p53 mutants by CHIP is shown to be via autophagy through K63-linked poly-ubiquitination. Both in normoxia and under physiological hypoxia the level of p53 aggregating mutants in presence of CHIP was reduced by three fold whereas under serum starvation it was reduced by five fold. Interestingly, both wild -type and p53 mutants interact with and stabilize CHIP at post-translational level thus suggesting a chaperon-synergy between p53 and CHIP. This finding may have strong therapeutic significance via selective degradation of oncogenic p53 mutants in regressing hypoxic tumor. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Hospital admission and socioeconomic deprivation have been associated with mental health disorders Demographics from Information Services Division Scotland were analysed over a period of 20 years. This focused on gender, number of admissions, number of bed days, socioeconomic deprivation (Scottish Multiple Index of Deprivation) and mortality within one year. Data from 54,501 patients were assessed. Admission numbers and length of stay has significantly decreased (p<0.0001). Males are more frequently affected (p=0.001). Admission numbers were higher for patients in more deprived areas (p<0.001). Mean duration of stay has decreased by 1 bed day. Surgical intervention of epistaxis has increased significantly (p<0.001). There is an associated one year mortality rate of 9.8% following epistaxis. There has been a significant decrease in hospital admissions and length of hospital stay in patients admitted with epistaxis over the past 20 years. There is a significant association with deprivation and epistaxis admission. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
29953725," Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is emerging as a central regulator in inflammatory processes, as documented by increasing studies reported in the literature. For instance, the activation of this nicotinic receptor subtype in resident macrophages inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby attenuating local inflammatory responses, and may open a new window in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disease, such as Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and asthma. In continuation of our ongoing research for the development of new cholinergic drug candidates, we selected the nicotine derivative CAP55, which was previously shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects via nicotinic stimulation, as a suitable compound for lead optimization. Through the isosteric replacement of its 3,5-disubstituted 4,5-dihydroisoxazole core with a 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole ring, we could rapidly generate a small library of CAP55-related analogues via a one-pot copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition. Receptor binding assays at nAChRs led to the identification of two promising derivatives, compounds 4 and 10, worthy of further pharmacological studies. This article is protected by copyright.

29953724," The chiral, triangular-shape hexaimine macrocycles (trianglimines), bearing bulky alkynyl or aryl substituents were synthesized and studied by means of experimental and theoretical methods. The macrocyclization reactions are driven by the extraordinary stability of the trianglimine ring and provided products with high yields. Electrostatic repulsion between imine nitrogen atoms and the substituents forced anti conformation of the aromatic linkers. While the DFT-optimized structure of 7 is D₃-symmetrical, in the crystal, the macrocycle adopts a bowl-like molecular shape. The macrocycle self-assembles into tail-to-tail dimers by mutual interdigitation of aromatic moieties. Contrary, macrocycle 8 adopts a rigid pillararene-like conformation. The nature of substituent significantly affects the electronic properties of the linker. As a result, unexpectedly high exiton Cotton effects are observed in ECD spectra. The origin of these effects was a subject of in-depth study."
29953723," Exosomes are distinguished from other types of extracellular vesicles by their small and relatively uniform size (30-100 nm) and their composition which reflects their endo-lysosomal origin. Involvement of these extracellular organelles in intercellular communication and their implication in pathological conditions has fuelled intensive research on mammalian exosomes; however, currently, very little is known about exosomes in lower vertebrates. Here we show that, in primary cultures of head kidney leukocytes from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), phosphorothioate CpG oligodeoxynucleotides induce secretion of vesicles with characteristics very similar to these of mammalian exosomes. Further experiments revealed that the oligonucleotide-induced exosome secretion did not depend on the CpG motifs but it relied on the phosphorothioate modification of the internucleotide linkage. Exosome secretion was also induced by genomic bacterial and eukaryotic DNA in toll-like receptor 9-negative piscine and human cell lines demonstrating that this is a phylogenetically conserved phenomenon which does not depend on activation of immune signaling pathways. In addition to exosomes, stimulation with phosphorothioate oligonucleotides and genomic DNA induced secretion of LC3B-II, an autophagosome marker, which was associated with vesicles of diverse size and morphology, possibly derived from autophagosome-related intracellular compartments. Overall, this work reveals a previously unrecognized biological activity of phosphorothioate ODNs and genomic DNA - their capacity to induce secretion of exosomes and other types of extracellular vesicles. This finding might help shed light on the side effects of therapeutic phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides and the biological activity of extracellular genomic DNA which is often upregulated in pathological conditions.

29953722," Engineering the electronic properties by elemental doping represents a direct strategy to design efficient catalysts towards CO2 electroreduction. Herein, we modified atomically thin SnS2 nanosheets with Ni doping for efficient electroreduction of CO2. The introduction of Ni into SnS2 nanosheets significantly enhanced the current density and Faradaic efficiency for carbonaceous product relative to pristine SnS2 nanosheets. When the Ni content was 5% in atomic percentage, the Ni doped SnS2 nanosheets achieved a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 93% for carbonaceous product with a current density of 19.6 mA cm-2 at -0.9 V vs RHE. Mechanistic study revealed that the Ni doping gave rise to a defect level and lowered the work function of SnS2 nanosheets, resulting in the promoted CO2 activation and thus improved performance in CO2 electroreduction."
29953721," Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the leading cause of recurrent infections in humans including endocarditis, pneumonia, and toxic shock syndrome. Novel therapeutics to treat MRSA and other resistant bacteria are urgently needed. Adjuvant therapy, which uses a non-toxic compound to repotentiate the toxic effects of an existing antibiotic, is an attractive response to the growing resistance crisis. Herein we describe the evaluation of structurally-related, FDA-approved tricyclic amine antidepressants that selectively repotentiate MRSA to β-lactam antibiotics. Our results identify important structural features of the tricyclic amine class for β-lactam adjuvant activity. Furthermore, we describe the mechanism of action for our lead compound, amoxapine, and illustrate that it represses the mRNA levels of key β-lactam resistance genes in response to β-lactam treatment. This work is novel in that it highlights an important class of small molecules with the ability to simultaneously inhibit production of both β-lactamase and penicillin-binding protein 2a.

29953720," Pulp necrosis is a frequent complication following dental trauma. The diagnosis of the state of the dental pulp can be challenging as most commonly used diagnostic tools are subjective and rely on a response from the patient, potentially making their use unreliable, especially in the child population. The aim of the study was to systematically review the evidence on the use of laser Doppler flowmetry in the assessment of the pulp status of permanent teeth compared to other sensibility and/or vitality tests. A systematic literature search, using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.controlled-trials.com, in addition to citation and manual reference list searches, was conducted up to 15 Four studies with a high risk of bias were included in the final analysis. Laser Doppler flowmetry was reported to be more accurate in differentiating between teeth with normal pulps and pulp necrosis with a sensitivity of (81.8-100%) and specificity of 100% in comparison to other vitality tests such as pulp oximetry (sensitivity = 81.3%, specificity = 94.9%) and sensibility tests such as electric pulp testing (sensitivity = 63.3 - 91.5%, specificity = 88 - 100%). Despite the higher reported sensitivity and specificity of laser Doppler flowmetry in assessing pulp blood flow, these data are based on studies with a high level of bias and serious shortfalls in study designs. More research is needed to study the effect of different laser Doppler flowmetry's parameters on its diagnostic accuracy and the true cut-off ratios over which a tooth could be diagnosed as having a normal pulp.

29953719," To describe the aerobic conjunctival bacterial flora of 3 especies of free-living and under human care sea turtles and determine its antimicrobial susceptibility in vitro. Thirty-six sea turtles (72 eyes), juveniles and adults, 7 free-living Chelonia mydas and 8 Chelonia mydas, 4 Caretta caretta, 11 Eretmochelys imbricata, and 6 Lepidochelys olivacea under human care, were evaluated. Conjunctival cultures were collected for identification of aerobic bacteria and antimicrobial susceptibility testing for ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, neomycin, oxacillin, polymyxin B, tetracycline, and tobramycin using antibiotic disks. Bacterial strains showing no sensitivity to 4 or more antimicrobials were considered multiresistant to this panel. Bacterial growth was observed in 12/14 (85.71%) samples in the free-living sea turtles, and there was growth in 100% (58/58) of the samples from captive animals. There were 94 strains isolated and 15 species identified. There was a predominance of Gram-positive bacteria in free-living Chelonia mydas, most of which were Bacillus and Staphylococcus. The most commonly isolated Gram-negative species were enterobacteria for free-living and under human care animals. The strains were predominantly sensitive to ciprofloxacin and tobramycin, and less sensitive to oxacillin or polymyxin B. Ten multiresistant strains were isolated. Yeast were identified in 13.89% (10/72) of the samples. These results, showing differences in the conjunctival bacterial flora of free-living and captive animals, may be helpful for diagnosis and treatment of ocular disorders in sea turtles."
29953718," Oligomeric amyloid structures are crucial therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's and other amyloid diseases. However, these oligomers are too small to be resolved by standard light microscopy. We have developed a simple and versatile tool to image amyloid structures using Thioflavin T without the need for covalent labeling or immunostaining. Dynamic binding of single dye molecules generates photon bursts that are used for fluorophore localization on a nanometer scale. Thus, photobleaching cannot degrade image quality, allowing for extended observation times. Super-resolution Transient Amyloid Binding (TAB) microscopy promises to directly image native amyloid using standard probes and record amyloid dynamics over minutes to days. We imaged amyloid fibrils from multiple polypeptides, oligomeric, and fibrillar structures formed during different stages of amyloid-β aggregation, as well as the structural remodeling of amyloid-β fibrils by the compound epi-gallocatechin gallate (EGCG)."
29953717," Hysterectomy is the second most common surgery performed for mainly benign uterine pathologies in females. The association between hysterectomy and the subsequent risk of hypertension remains controversial. This study investigated the risk of developing hypertension in women who had a hysterectomy. Population-based retrospective cohort study. We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database with claims data of 1 million randomly selected insured individuals. Women with and without hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, aged 30-49 years, identified in 2000-2013 from the insurance data. From the claims data, we identified 6674 women with hysterectomy without hypertension at the time of the surgery. The comparison cohort were 26,696 women randomly selected from women without hysterectomy and hypertension, matched by age and the year with hysterectomy was performed. Adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of hypertension was estimated after controlling for co-morbidities. Prediction for hypertension following hysterectomy for benign disease. Both cohorts had a median age of 43.9 years. After a median follow-up of 6.4 years, the incident hypertension was higher in the hysterectomy cohort than in the comparison cohort, with an adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] of 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27-1.44). The incidence increased with age, with an aHR greater in hysterectomised women aged 40-49 years (aHR= 1.37, 95% CI= 1.06-1.83) than in those aged 30-39 years (aHR 1.22, 95% CI= 1.02-1.46). Findings in this study suggests that women with hysterectomy are more likely to be diagnosed with hypertension in the follow-up period. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
29953716," Stroke is a major cause of disability worldwide, and is the second leading cause of death after ischemic heart disease. Until recently, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) was the only treatment for acute ischemic stroke. If administered within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, tPA improves the outcome in stroke patients. Mechanical thrombectomy is now the preferred treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke due to a large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation. However, widespread use of mechanical thrombectomy is limited by 2 factors. First, only about 10% of patients with acute ischemic stroke have a proximal large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation and present early enough to undergo mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours; an additional 9% to 10% of patients presenting within the 6 to 24 hour time window may also qualify for the procedure. Second, not all stroke centers have the resources or expertise to perform mechanical thrombectomy. Nonetheless, patients who present to hospitals where thrombectomy is not an option can receive intravenous tPA, and those with qualifying anterior circulation strokes can then be transferred to tertiary stroke centers where thrombectomy is available. Therefore, despite the advances afforded by mechanical thrombectomy, there remains a need for treatments that improve the efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy. In this review, we discuss (a) current treatment options for acute ischemic stroke, (b) the mechanism of action of fibrinolytic agents and (c) potential strategies to manipulate the fibrinolytic system to promote endogenous fibrinolysis or to enhance the efficacy of fibrinolytic therapy.

29953715," In epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, epithelial cells lose their features, acquiring a mesenchymal-like phenotype. Nm23-H1 protein relates to tumor cells' metastatic potential, its low expression in carcinomas often meaning a poor prognosis. This study newly investigated the role of nuclear nm23-H1 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Immunohistochemical analyses of nuclear nm23-H1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Snail, Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox (ZEB)1, and ZEB2 were performed in 33 consecutive patients with laryngeal SCC. Mean nuclear nm23-H1 expression was lower in patients whose disease recurred (P = .0046). Disease-free survival (DFS) was longer for patients whose nuclear nm23-H1 expression was ≥10% (P = .0083). Nuclear nm23-H1 and E-cadherin expressions correlated directly (P = .018). Mean E-cadherin expression was lower in patients whose disease recurred (P = .03). The DFS was shorter in patients with ZEB2 expression ≥5% (P = .006). Nuclear nm23-H1 expression warrants further investigation in laryngeal SCC as a prognostic marker identifying patients at higher risk of recurrence. nm23-H1 targeted treatments may be capable of regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition."
29953714," Anterior temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis is a very effective measure to control seizures, and the probability of being seizure-free is approximately 70-90%. However, 30% of patients still experience seizures after surgery. An Aura is a subjective ictal phenomenon that may precede an observable seizure. Nevertheless, few are the studies associating the prognostic factor with aura, although, being the initial symptoms of epileptic seizures, many types of auras have significant localizing or lateralizing value. This study hypothesized that the type of preoperative aura may predict the postsurgical outcome in patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy due to mesial temporal sclerosis. Of 1214 patients evaluated for surgery in the epilepsy Center of Faculdade de Medicina de São Jose do Rio Preto (FAMERP), a tertiary Brazilian epilepsy center, 400 underwent ATL for MTS. Number and type of auras was analyzed and compared with Engel classification for outcome. Analyzing the patients by the type of aura, those who had extratemporal auras had worst result in post-surgical in Engel classifcation. While mesial auras apparently is a good prognostic factor. Patients without aura also had worse prognosis. Simple and multiple aura had no difference. In order to identify the most appropriate candidates for ATL, is very important to consider the prognostic factors associated with favorable for counseling patients in daily practice.

29953713," Only a few studies have addressed liver stiffness dynamics after hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection. The aim was to evaluate the variation in liver stiffness and in serum liver fibrosis scores in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients before and after treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Liver stiffness measured using transient elastography as well as serum liver fibrosis scores [fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score and the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI)] were evaluated before and at 6-12 months after DAA treatment. Variation in the outcome variables was evaluated using the Wilcoxon nonparametric test. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression models were used. A total of 78 HIV/HCV-coinfected subjects were included in the study. Median values of hepatic stiffness significantly decreased after DAA treatment compared with baseline [16.8 (interquartile range (IQR) 10.2-27.0) kPa at baseline vs. 9.4 (IQR 6.7-15.0) kPa after DAA treatment; P < 0.01). Further, a decrease in median FIB-4 score [2.8 (IQR 1.5-4.8) vs. 2.0 (IQR 1.3-3.2), respectively; P < 0.01] and APRI [0.9 (IQR 0.5-2.2) vs. 0.4 (IQR 0.2-0.7), respectively; P < 0.01] was found. In univariate analysis, liver stiffness decrease was associated with increasing age, 'other' HCV genotype (vs. G1), the presence of cirrhosis, higher pre-DAA liver stiffness, sofosbuvir-based regimens and longer DAA treatment (all P < 0.05). Multivariate regression confirmed the significance of the association only with higher baseline liver stiffness (P < 0.01). Greater FIB-4 and APRI reductions were associated with higher respective baseline values, while the presence of hepatic steatosis correlated with lower score reduction after DAA. A reduction in liver stiffness and an improvement in fibrosis scores were observed in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients soon after DAA treatment. The clinical implications of these observations need to be evaluated in larger populations with longer follow-up."
29953712," The substrate flexibility of eight purified sesquiterpene cyclases was evaluated using six new heteroatom modified farnesyl pyrophosphates and the formation of six new heteroatom-modified macrocyclic and tricyclic sesquiterpenoids is described. GC-O analysis revealed that tricyclic furan exhibits an ethereal, peppery and camphor-like olfactoric scent."
29953711," Metabolic incorporation of bioorthogonal functional groups into cellular nucleic acids can be impeded by insufficient phosphorylation of nucleosides. Previous studies found that 5-(azidomethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (AmdU) was incorporated into the DNA of HeLa cells expressing a low-fidelity thymidine kinase, but not by wild-type HeLa cells. Here we report that membrane-permeable phosphotriester derivatives of AmdU can exhibit enhanced incorporation into the DNA of wild-type cells and animals. AmdU monophosphate derivatives carrying either 5'-bispivaloyloxymethyl (POM), 5'-bisacetoxybenzyl (AB), or ""Protide"" protective groups were used to mask the phosphate group of AmdU prior to its entry into cells. The POM derivative ""POM-AmdU"" exhibited superior chemical stability, greater metabolic incorporation efficiency, and lower toxicity than ""AB-AmdU"". Remarkably, the addition of POM-AmdU to the water of zebrafish larvae enabled the biosynthesis of azide-modified DNA throughout the body."
29953710, Surface methoxy species bound to an extra-framework Al (SMS-EFAL) was unambiguously identified by advanced 13C-{27Al} double-resonance solid-state NMR technique in the methanol-to-olefins reaction on H-ZSM-5 zeolite. The high reactivity of the SMS-EFAL leads to the formation of surface ethoxy species and ethanol as the key intermediates for ethene generation in the early reaction stage. A direct route for the first C-C bond formation in ethene was proposed and corroborated by density functional theory calculations.
29953709," Herein we report the single-step construction of anti-configured deoxypropionate motif by syndiospecific propylene oligomerization catalyzed by CS-symmetric zirconocene complex. After oligomerization, oxidation of the oligomers by oxygen afforded oligopropylene alcohols in a single step. This strategy was applied to the single-step preparation of rel-(2S,4R,6S,8R)-2,4,6,8-tetramethylundecan-1-ol, the racemic mixture of the synthetic fragment of the cuticular hydrocarbons isolated from the cane beetle Antitrogus parvulus."
29953708," Phylogenetic analyses of trait evolution can provide insight into the evolutionary processes that initiate and drive phenotypic diversification. However, recent phylogenomic studies have revealed extensive gene tree-species tree discordance, which can lead to incorrect inferences of trait evolution if only a single species tree is used for analysis. This phenomenon-dubbed ""hemiplasy""-is particularly important to consider during analyses of character evolution in rapidly radiating groups, where discordance is widespread. Here we generate whole-transcriptome data for a phylogenetic analysis of 14 species in the plant genus Jaltomata (the sister clade to Solanum), which has experienced rapid, recent trait evolution, including in fruit and nectar color, and flower size and shape. Consistent with other radiations, we find evidence for rampant gene tree discordance due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and to introgression events among the well-supported subclades. Since both ILS and introgression increase the probability of hemiplasy, we perform several analyses that take discordance into account while identifying genes that might contribute to phenotypic evolution. Despite discordance, the history of fruit color evolution in Jaltomata can be inferred with high confidence, and we find evidence of de novo adaptive evolution at individual genes associated with fruit color variation. In contrast, hemiplasy appears to strongly affect inferences about floral character transitions in Jaltomata, and we identify candidate loci that could arise either from multiple lineage-specific substitutions or standing ancestral polymorphisms. Our analysis provides a generalizable example of how to manage discordance when identifying loci associated with trait evolution in a radiating lineage. This article is protected by copyright.

29953707," Activation of carbon-fluorine (C-F) bonds is an important topic in synthetic organic chemistry recently. Among the methods for C-F bond cleavage, metal mediated and catalyzed β- or α-fluorine elimination proceeds under mild conditions compared with oxidative addition of C-F bond. The β- or α-fluorine elimination is initiated from organometallic intermediates having fluorine substituents on carbon atoms β or α to metal centers, respectively. Transformations via these elimination processes (C-F bond cleavage), which are typically preceded by carbon-carbon (or carbon-heteroatom) bond formation, have been remarkably developed as C-F bond activation methods in the past five years. In this minireview, we summarize the applications of transition metal-mediated and -catalyzed fluorine elimination to synthetic organic chemistry from a historical perspective for early studies and from a systematic perspective for recent studies."
29953706," A readily-available small molecular hole-transporting material (HTM), OMe-TATPyr, is synthesized and tested in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). OMe-TATPyr is a two-dimensional π-conjugated molecule with a pyrene core and four phenyl-thiophene bridged triarylamine groups. It can be readily synthesized in gram scale with a low lab cost of around 50 US$/g. The incorporation of the phenyl-thiophene units in OMe-TATPyr are beneficial for not only carrier transportation through improved charge delocalization and intermolecular stacking, but also potential trap passivation via Pb-S interaction as supported by depth-profiling XPS, photoluminescence, and electrochemical impedance analysis. As a result, an impressive best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 20.6% and an average PCE of 20.0% with good stability has been achieved for mixed-cation PSCs with OMe-TATPyr with an area of 0.09 cm2. A device with an area of 1.08 cm2 based on OMe-TATPyr demonstrates a PCE of 17.3%. Together with the scalable synthesis and low cost of OMe-TATPyr, such an impressive performance makes it a new promising HTM for efficient and stable PSCs."
29953705," The aim was to assess the influence of dietary counselling on the pubertal development and hormonal status in healthy adolescents. We used a subcohort of 193 healthy boys (52%) and girls (48%) from the Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project. Participants were recruited by nurses at the well-baby clinics in Turku Finland in 1990-1992 and randomised into intervention and control groups. Intervention children received low saturated fat and low cholesterol dietary counselling initiated at 7 months of age. Participants were examined once a year with Tanner staging, anthropometric measurements and serial reproductive hormones from 10 to 19 years of age. In girls, postmenarcheal hormones were not analysed. Pubertal hormones in boys or girls did not differ between the intervention and control groups. However, we observed slight differences in pubertal progression by Tanner staging and in anthropometric parameters. The intervention boys progressed faster to G4 (p=0.008), G5 (p=0.008) and P5 (p=0.03). The intervention boys were taller than control boys (p=0.04), while weight and body mass index did not differ. Dietary intervention did not affect pubertal hormonal status. This finding supports the safety of implemented counselling in respect to puberty. This article is protected by copyright.

29953704," Crown ethers have been known for over 50 years, but no example of a complex between a noble-gas compound and a crown ether or another polydentate ligand had been reported. Xenon trioxide is shown to react with 15-crown-5 to form the kinetically stable (CH₂CH₂O)₅XeO₃ adduct which, in marked contrast with solid XeO₃, does not detonate when mechanically shocked. The crystal structure shows that the five oxygen atoms of the crown ether are coordinated to the xenon atom of XeO₃. The gas-phase Wiberg bond valences and indices and empirical bond valences indicate the Xe---O(crown) bonds are predominantly electrostatic and are consistent with σ-hole bonding. Mappings of the electrostatic potential (EP) onto the Hirshfeld surfaces of XeO₃ and 15-crown-5 in (CH₂CH₂O)₅XeO₃ and a detailed examination of the molecular electrostatic potential surface (MEPS) of XeO₃ and (CH₂CH₂O)₅ reveal regions of negative EP on the oxygen atoms of (CH₂CH₂O)₅ and regions of high positive EP on the xenon atom that are also in accordance with σ-hole interactions."
29953703," Investigations of solid mixtures of the elemental combinations A/Tl/Pb (A = Na, K) and K/Tl/Bi indicate the presence of multiple binary and ternary Zintl phases, among them new ones containing Tl and Pb or Bi, respectively. Extractions with en/crypt-222 afford single crystals of several novel binary anions, including [Tl@Tl4Pb8]4- and (Tl4Bi3)3-. [Tl@Tl4Pb8]4- adopts a closo-type cage structure despite possessing one additional electron; it is therefore isostructural, yet not isoelectronic, with homoatomic [Tl@Tl12]11- obtained by solid state reactions. (Tl4Bi3)3- is a rare case of a pentagonal bipyramidal Zintl anion, yet the first binary one, and (unlike Tl77-) the first one with a proper closo-type electron count. Assignment of the numbers and positions of the Tl/Pb or Tl/Bi atoms within the anionic clusters, indistinguishable for X-rays, was achieved by means of quantum chemistry. The studies shed light on the complex situation in solid heavy element mixtures and their substantial differences from the composition of the Zintl anions obtained from them by extraction."
29953702," Noise is defined as ""sound that is unwanted, unpleasant, or harmful to health."" It may induce negative emotions and mental health problems and even may leads to increased suicide risk. Little attention has been paid so far to a potential link between noise and suicide. We investigated the association between nighttime environmental noise and suicide death in adults in the Republic of Korea. We analyzed the data from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort, with a 4-year baseline (2002-2005) and an 8-year follow-up (2006-2013) assessment. A total of 155,492 adults constituted the study sample: younger adults (20-54 years, n = 124,994), or older adults (≥55 years, n = 30,498), and adults with mood and anxiety disorders (n = 34,615). Suicide death was defined as per International Classification of Diseases-10 code X60-X84. Data on nighttime noise were obtained from the National Noise Information System. During the study period, 315 (0.2%) died of suicide. The incidence of suicide per 100,000 person-years was 25.71. With interquartile range increases in nighttime noise, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for suicide death was significantly increased: 1.32 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.70) for younger adults, 1.43 (95% CI: 1.01-2.02) for older adults, and 1.55 (95% CI: 1.10-2.19) for adults with mental illness. In the penalized regression spline models, the HRs for suicide death were gradually increased with environmental noise levels, and the risk was the highest for adults with mental illness. We found a significant association between exposure to nighttime noise and the risk of suicide death in adults in the Republic of Korea."
29953701," To determine the association of differential leukocyte counts on admission with efficacy and safety outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). Consecutive AIS patients receiving IVT were evaluated at two stroke centers. Differential leukocyte counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were determined during initial 12 hours of admission. Efficacy outcomes involved favorable functional outcome (FFO) [mRS-scores of 0-1] and functional independence (FI) [mRS-scores of 0-2] at three months; whereas safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) and three-month mortality. Among 657 IVT-treated AIS patients, mean age was 64±14, 50% were female and median NIHSS was 7 points [IQR 4-13]. Lower neutrophil, leukocyte and NLR counts were observed in patients with 3-month FFO and FI, whereas higher counts were observed in patients who expired at three months. The best discriminative factor for 3-month FFO and FI were NLR<2.2 (sensitivity 51.4%, specificity 63.1%) and leukocyte <8,100/μL (sensitivity 57.5%, specificity 55.1%), respectively. After adjustment for potential confounders, NLR <2.2 was associated with higher odds of FFO (OR: 1.56; 95%CI: 1.08-2.24; p=0.018), leukocyte count <8,100/μL was associated with higher odds of 3-month FI (OR: 1.69; 95%CI: 1.11-2.57; p=0.014) and lower odds of 3-month mortality (OR: 0.31; 95%CI: 0.16-0.60; p=0.001), whereas combined neutrophil (<6,800/μL) and leukocyte (<8,100/μL) counts were associated with 3-month FI (OR: 1.73; 95%CI: 1.13-2.67; p=0.012). Admission differential leukocyte counts are independently associated with clinical outcomes in AIS patients treated with IVT and might represent potential inflammatory targets for adjunctive neuroprotection in this stroke subgroup.

29953700," The issue of violence in secure services has long been recognized both in the UK and worldwide. However, there is currently scarce literature available about violence within learning disability (LD) secure settings. Secondary data analysis was conducted on violent incidents, using information routinely collected by the staff over a 1-year period. Physical assaults were the most frequent type of incident, and the distribution in terms of days or months was homogenous and incidents were concentrated in the corridors, lounges and dining rooms of secure facilities. Antipsychotic medication was not regularly prescribed. Generalized linear modelling analyses revealed significant predictors that increased the chances of seclusion and physical restraint, such as being female or directing the violence towards staff. These findings can inform staff training on violence prevention and suggest that increased ward-based supervision and enhanced use of psychological formulations may help in reducing violence within this service context."
29953699," Motor neuron disease (MND) refers to a spectrum of degenerative diseases affecting motor neurons. Recent clinical and postmortem observations have revealed considerable variability in the phenotype. Rhythmic involuntary oscillations of the hands during action, resembling tremor, can occur in MND, but its pathophysiology has not yet been investigated. 120 consecutive MND patients were screened for tremor. Twelve patients with action tremor and no other movement disorders were found. Ten took part in the study. Tremor was recorded bilaterally using surface electromyography and triaxial accelerometer, with and without a variable weight load. Power spectra of rectified electromyography and accelerometric signal were calculated. To investigate a possible cerebellar involvement, eye blink classic conditioning (EBCC) was performed in five patients. Action tremor was present in about 10% of our population. All patients showed distal postural tremor of low amplitude and constant frequency, bilateral with a small degree of asymmetry. Two of them showed also simple kinetic tremor. A peak at the electromyography and accelerometric recordings ranging from 4 Hz to 12 Hz was found in all patients. Loading did not change peak frequency in either the electromyographic or accelerometric power spectra. Compared with healthy volunteers, patients had a smaller number of conditioned responses during EBCC. our data suggest that MND patients can present with action tremor of a central origin, possibly due to a cerebellar dysfunction. This evidence supports the novel idea of MND as a multisystem neurodegenerative disease and that action tremor can be part of this condition. This article is protected by copyright.

29953696," Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is the most feared complication in patients treated with oral anticoagulants due to non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) reduce the risk of ICH compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of fatal NOAC-related ICH compared to VKA-related ICH. We calculated the corresponding risk ratios (RRs) in each included study to express the relative risk of fatal ICH among all patients receiving oral anticoagulation with either NOACs or VKAs. We additionally evaluated the mortality rates in NOAC-related and VKA-related ICH in patients treated with and without NOAC-specific reversal agents (idarucizumab and factor Xa inhibitors antidote). Case fatality was evaluated at 30-90 days following symptom onset. Our literature search identified 6 eligible studies (4 RCTs and 2 open-label trials of NOAC-specific reversal agents). In pairwise analyses NOACs were found to have lower risk of fatal ICH compared to VKAs (RR=0.46, 95%CI: 0.36-0.58) with no heterogeneity (I NOACs halve the risk of fatal ICH in NVAF patients compared to VKAs, while indirect comparisons indicate that NOAC-specific reversal agents may be associated with lower case fatality rate in NOAC-related ICH.

29953695," Supporting an adult with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be associated with family stress but also with personal growth and resilience. Research providing insight into how typically developing siblings make sense of their unique sibling relationships in adulthood remains limited. Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, this study explored subjective experiences of eight siblings of adults with ASD and co-occurring intellectual disability. Analysis of interview transcripts revealed a complex lived experience explained by the overarching theme ""engaging with and navigating limbo"", which was characterized by commitment to the sibling relationship, power tensions in the family, uncertainty about the future and negotiating the tension between relational closeness and distance. Using family systems theory, overregulation and closed communication emerged as processes relevant to families living with ASD. Clinical opportunities to support family communication, change tolerance and belonging are discussed."
29953694," Objective screening tool for patients at a high risk of developing acute brain injury (ABI) is necessary for the proper treatment of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning patients. The aim of this study is to identify clinical factors that could predict ABI due to CO poisoning in patients with an altered mental status. A prospectively collected CO poisoning registry at a single academic medical center was retrospectively analyzed. CO poisoning patients with an altered mental status at the emergency department, defined as unalert on the Alert/responsive to Voice/responsive to Pain/Unresponsive scale, and underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2015, were included. ABI was defined as the presence of acute hypoxic brain lesions. Clinical predictors of ABI were identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Of 180 patients, 67 (37.2%) had ABI as revealed by DW-MRI. Multivariate analysis showed that CO exposure duration > 5 hours (AOR [adjusted odds ratio], 7.082; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.463-15.014; P<.001) defined as the time between CO exposure and rescue, abnormal WBC count (AOR, 2.568; 95% CI, 1.188-5.700; P=.02), and abnormal creatinine concentration (AOR, 2.667; 95% CI, 1.110-6.605; P=.03) were predictors of ABI. CO exposure duration had the highest predictive value (area under the curve, 0.815), and the optimal cutoff value was 5 hours. Moreover, increasing exposure durations (quartile) indicated a stepwise increase in the risk of ABI. In CO poisoning patients with an altered mental status, CO exposure duration was useful for predicting ABI, which may help clinicians or paramedics identify high-risk patients and provide treatment on priority.

29953693," To probe the inhibitory effects of deoxynivalenol (DON) on growth and biofilms of yeast and bacterial pathogens. Crystal violet quantification, XTT reduction assay, confocal and scanning electron microscopic imaging, and yeast-to-hyphal inhibition assays were performed to demonstrate the inhibitory effects of DON. Our results show that DON and its modified form (3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol) caused dose-dependent inhibition of Candida albicans pathogenesis under in vitro conditions. DON significantly reduced C. albicans biofilm formation and metabolic activities, disrupted pre-formed biofilms without affecting planktonic cell growth, and inhibited hyphal protrusions in embedded colonies and free-living planktonic cells. We also show that DON and its derivatives function by interacting with lanosterol 14α-demethylase, thus mimicking the action mechanism of azole drugs. Highlighting the importance of C. albicans biofilms and hyphal filamentations in inducing pathogen vigor, this study demonstrates the anti-hyphal and anti-biofilm potential of DON against C. albicans. Mycotoxin-producing molds are able to dominate and control other microbes and insects in ecological niches. At times, they are known to eradicate biofilms of their intruders or symbiotic partners. In view of this coincident notion, the study proposes a role for mycotoxins as a biofilm inhibitor in ecological niches. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
29953692," This study examined differential patterns of time spent using social media in a sample of 457 adolescents over a 6-year period. The majority of adolescents (83%), termed moderate users, reported steady social media use over time. A second group (increasers: 12%) reported low social media use that increased gradually and ended high at the end of the study. A third group, called peak users (6%), reported low social media that increased quickly after a few years and then returned to baseline levels. Low self-regulation predicted being an increaser or peak user. Being a moderate user tended to be related to lower levels of depression, aggression, delinquency, social media problems, and cyberbullying across time, as compared with the other groups."

29953690," In the general population, the transition from adolescence to adulthood has been identified as a ""high-risk"" period for weight gain. There has been no research examining health behaviours over this transition in adults with intellectual disabilities. The feasibility of recruitment, retention and relevant health behaviours were measured in 31 adolescents with mild-moderate intellectual disabilities. Anthropometric, objective physical activity, dietary and self-determination measures were collected over a 12-month transitional period from school to adulthood. Key results suggest weight and BMI increased significantly from month 6 to month 12 (p = 0.044 and p = 0.043). Waist circumference increased significantly from baseline to month 12 (p = 0.049), and from month 6 to month 12 (p = 0.03). Recruiting and retaining young adults with intellectual disabilities over a 12-month health behaviour study is feasible. The data indicate the transition from school to adulthood may be the start of a high-risk period for weight gain."
29953689," Visual hallucinations (VHs) can occur in several clinical conditions, of which the dementias, broadly defined, and Parkinson's disease rank among the most common. There is limited research on the lived experience of hallucinations among affected individuals and therefore a lack of evidence-based management strategies. This study used qualitative methods to explore the VH experience of individuals with dementia or Parkinson's disease and their informal caregivers. In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 individuals with VHs and dementia and 11 informal caregivers, and 11 individuals with VHs and Parkinson's disease and 9 informal caregivers. Interviews were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Three themes emerged from the data: ""Insight and distress,"" ""Caregiver approach: challenging v reassurance,"" and ""Normality and stigma."" Insight appeared to affect whether hallucinations were perceived as threatening and whether acceptance occurred over time. Emotional reactions and management strategies varied as insight changed with disease progression. Concerns around stigmatisation negatively influenced help-seeking and acceptance of the hallucinations. Degree of insight and cognitive ability appear fundamental to the lived experience of hallucinations. Irrespective of the clinical context, support in early stages should focus on raising awareness of VH, symptom disclosure, stigma reduction, and contact with others affected. In later stages, the focus shifts to informal caregiver needs and a flexible approach to reassuring those affected."
29953688," Genomic imprinting is a conspicuous feature of the endosperm, a triploid tissue nurturing the embryo and synchronizing angiosperm seed development. An unknown subset of imprinted genes (IGs) is critical for successful seed development and should have highly conserved functions. Recent genome-wide studies have found limited conservation of IGs among distantly related species, but there is a paucity of data from closely related lineages. Moreover, most studies focused on model plants with nuclear endosperm development, and comparisons with properties of IGs in cellular-type endosperm development are lacking. Using laser-assisted microdissection, we characterized parent-specific expression in the cellular endosperm of three wild tomato lineages (Solanum section Lycopersicon). We identified 1,025 candidate IGs and 167 with putative homologs previously identified as imprinted in distantly related taxa with nuclear-type endosperm. Forty-two maternally expressed genes (MEGs) and 17 paternally expressed genes (PEGs) exhibited conserved imprinting status across all three lineages, but differences in power to assess imprinted expression imply that the actual degree of conservation might be higher than that directly estimated (20.7% for PEGs and 10.4% for MEGs). Regardless, the level of shared imprinting status was higher for PEGs than for MEGs, indicating dissimilar evolutionary trajectories. Expression-level data suggest distinct epigenetic modulation of MEGs and PEGs, and gene ontology analyses revealed MEGs and PEGs to be enriched for different functions. Importantly, our data provide evidence that MEGs and PEGs interact in modulating both gene expression and the endosperm cell cycle, and uncovered conserved cellular functions of IGs uniting taxa with cellular- and nuclear-type endosperm.

29953687," Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) gene activated muscle tissue fragments can regenerate large bone defects in preclinical animal models. The use of tissue fragments instead of isolated cells expedites gene-enhanced tissue engineering and may raise chances for clinical translation. The present in vitro study investigates whether the osteoinductive effect of BMP-2 on muscle tissue fragments can be enhanced by use of the heterodimers BMP-2/6 or BMP-2/7. Skeletal muscle tissue fragments from rats were cultured in vitro for up to 20 days in normal medium, osteogenic medium, or osteogenic medium supplemented with either a low (50 ng/ml) or high (200 ng/ml) concentration of recombinant human BMP-2, BMP-2/6 or BMP-2/7. Osteoinduction was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, alizarin red S staining, immunohistology, and histomorphometry. Interestingly, BMP-2 was a significantly stronger inducer of osteogenic differentiation within muscle tissue than both heterodimers. Even the low concentration of BMP-2 elicited significantly higher levels of calcium deposition, bone-specific gene expression and protein production than the high concentration of both heterodimers. At the high concentration, BMP-2/7 had a significantly stronger osteogenic effect on muscle than BMP-2/6. The homodimer BMP-2 induced osteoblastogenesis in muscle faster, at a lower concentration, and with higher potency than the heterodimers BMP-2/6 or BMP-2/7. The findings of this in vitro study encourage bone repair by muscle implants in combination with BMP-2 single growth factor delivery, which might be beneficial with respect to clinical translation."
29953685," Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is positively associated with obesity, mostly in young women. The global increase in obesity may influence the burden of IIH. Using PubMed, Embase, Medline and Web of Science databases a meta-analysis and systematic review of epidemiological studies of IIH were performed up to June 2017. Temporal changes in IIH incidence were measured and incidence rates of IIH were correlated with country-specific World Health Organisation obesity rates. Prevalence data and shunting rates of IIH were recorded. The quality of epidemiological studies was assessed using the STandards of Reporting Of Neurological Disorders (STROND) criteria. In 15 identified studies there were 889 patients (87% women), mean age 29.8 years. The incidence of IIH ranged from 0.03 to 2.36 per 100,000 per year. Pooled incidence of IIH was 1.20 per 100,000/year although there was very high heterogeneity (I IIH is a public health concern as increased obesity prevalence is associated with increased incidence of IIH. Better quality of epidemiological studies is required to improve understanding of IIH and inform health policy for IIH management. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
29953684," Dry skin is a frequent and multifaceted condition which can be associated with skin irritation, itch, patient discomfort and manifest skin disease. In spite of being frequent, little is known about the epidemiology of dry skin in the population. To determine the prevalence of dry skin in the German adult population. Data of 48,630 employed persons were assessed on a cross-sectional level in whole body examinations by experienced dermatologists during company-based skin screenings conducted in 343 German companies. Next to the current dermatologic findings age, gender, allergies, atopic diseases and the skin type were assessed. In total, n = 14,300 persons (29.4 %) were rated as having xerotic skin. Older age but not gender were associated with xerosis. In the regression analyses controlling for age and gender, dry skin was a significant predictor for: Axillary dermatitis (OR 4.51; CI 2.70-7.54), atopic eczema (OR 3.99; CI 3.42-4.65), exsiccation eczema (OR 2.96; CI 2.40-3.65), psoriasis (OR 1.57; CI 1.38-1.78), plantar warts (OR 1.42; CI 1.26-1.60), seborrheic dermatitis (OR 1.28; CI 1.16-1.42), and atopic disposition (OR 1.17; CI 1.12-1.22). Dry skin is a frequent condition in the adult general population and needs special attention. Known risk factors may facilitate identifying patients at risk for deterioration.

29953683," Surfactants are ubiquitous in cellular membranes, detergents or as emulsification agents. Due to their amphiphilic properties, they can not only mediate between two domains of very different solvent compatibility like water and organic but also show fascinating self-assembly features resulting in micelles, vesicles or lyotropic liquid crystals. The current review article highlights some approaches towards the next generation surfactants, e.g. those with catalytically active heads. Furthermore, it is shown that amphiphilic properties can be obtained beyond the classical hydrophobic-hydrophilic interplay, for instance with surfactants containing one molecular block with a special shape. Whereas, classical surfactants are static, one became more and more interested in species, which are able to change their properties depending on external triggers. The article discusses examples for surfactants sensitive to chemical (e.g. pH-value) or physical triggers (temperature, electric and magnetic fields)."
29953682," A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) reported a significant marker in the dispatched homolog 1 (Drosophila) gene (DISP1 gene) associated with serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) antidepressant response (Qin et al., ). DISP1 has never been examined before in terms of association with SRI response until this GWAS. We attempt to replicate the GWAS finding by investigating the association of the DISP1 rs17162912 polymorphism with SRI response in our sample of 112 European Caucasian OCD patients. Patients were previously treated naturalistically with up to 6 different SRIs sequentially, including 5 selective SRIs (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine, and citalopram) and 1 SRI (clomipramine). Each medication trial was evaluated retrospectively for response and was rated categorically as either responder or nonresponder using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale. Fisher's exact test was used to investigate the relationship between the DISP1 rs17162912 genotype distribution and SRI response. We did not observe a significant association between rs17162912 and SRI response (p = .32). This replication study did not support the role of DISP1 in predicting SRI response in OCD; however, methodological differences between the original GWAS and our study, as well as limited power and low minor allele frequency, may have hindered replication."

29953680," Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) play a critical role in inflammatory properties of myeloid-derived cells. The effect of HIFs on myeloid-derived cell functions in organ transplantation remains unknown, however. We transplanted hearts into transgenic mice with myeloid cell-targeted deletions of HIF-1α or its negative regulator von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) to investigate the effects of HIF-1α inactivation or HIF-pathway activation, respectively, on ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and acute rejection. Deletion of VHL in myeloid cells enhanced mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory genes IDO, Arg-1, and HO-1 in vitro. In vivo, VHL-/- myeloid-derived cells of allograft recipients alleviated IRI and acute rejection, evidenced by reduced cardiomyocyte damage, decreased proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels, and absence of inflammatory infiltrate at 5 days after transplantation. Ultimately, allograft survival was significantly prolonged. In vitro, VHL-/- myeloid-derived cells dose-dependently inhibited T cell proliferation. Myeloid cells with HIF-1α-deletion retained proinflammatory qualities in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of VHL in myeloid cells of non-immunosuppressed cardiac allograft recipients reduces myocardial injury and acute rejection. We suggest that HIF transcription factors induce a regulatory phenotype in myeloid-derived cells, which may be harnessed as a novel therapeutic strategy to regulate immune responses after heart transplantation.

29953676," Psoriasis is a very prevalent systemic chronic inflammatory disease. Major cardiovascular events are the main cause of mortality in these patients which suggests an association between psoriasis and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Identify classic cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic syndrome (MS) in patients with psoriasis, their possible association with its severity and compare it with the non-psoriatic population. This is an observational and cross-sectional population study in Lleida (Spain) from a joint hospital / primary care database. The database comprised 398,701 individuals. There were 6,868 cases registered as psoriasis (1.7%), and 499 of them (7.3%) were classified as moderate-severe psoriasis. Patients with psoriasis had a higher prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors than non-psoriatic population: diabetes mellitus 2 (13.9% vs 7.4%, OR 2.01), dyslipidemia (28.8% vs 17.4%, OR 1.92), arterial hypertension (31.2% vs 19.0%, OR 1.93), obesity (33.7% vs 28.1%, OR 1.30), altered fasting basal glycaemia (21.4% vs 15.1%, OR 1.54), low cholesterol-HDL (38.1% vs 32.3%, OR 1.29), hypertriglyceridemia (45.7% vs 35.2%, OR 1.55) and high waist circumference (75.7% vs 72.3%, OR 1.19). MS was more prevalent in psoriatic patients (28.3% vs 15.1%, OR 2.21) and cardiovascular risk factors were similar between psoriasis severity groups. Psoriatic patients had a higher prevalence of ischemic heart disease (3.3% vs 1.8%, OR 1.87) and vascular-cerebral accidents (1.8% vs 1.2%, OR 1.55). A model for MS showed a significant non-linear relationship with age and sex, and significant differences between patients with and without psoriasis. We found statistically differences in relation to the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, MS and major cardiovascular events in psoriatic patients. However, differences were not seen between psoriasis severity groups. Our work reinforces the need for a multidisciplinary approach and close monitoring of cardiovascular risk factors in these patients to prevent a cardiovascular event.

29953675," Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition affecting up to 2% of the population (1), with epidermal hyperproliferation resulting in erythema-squamous skin lesions (2,3). The pathophysiology is multifactorial and is thought to be due to a combination of immunological, genetic and environmental factors. Moreover, psoriasis can be caused by an underlying condition that requires specific interventions in addition to conventional management of the skin disease. We report the case of an 83-year-old woman with generalized pustular psoriasis and Fahr's syndrome related to hypocalcemia. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
29953674," Test-retest reliability assessment of the dorsal clitoral artery's blood flow at rest and after muscle activation has never been documented. If this outcome measure is to be used in conditions impeding vascularity, it requires a psychometric evaluation. The aim of this study was to assess the inter-session test-retest reliability of clitoral blood flow in healthy women using color Doppler ultrasonography at rest and after a pelvic floor muscle (PFM) contraction task. Two assessment sessions were conducted using a clinical ultrasound system. Clitoral blood flow measurements were repeated at rest and after a PFM contraction task. Measurements of the peak systolic velocity (PSV), time-averaged maximum velocity (TAMX), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), pulsatility index (PI), and resistance index (RI) were taken. The test-retest reliability was assessed using paired t-test, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and Bland-Altman plots. For reliability at rest, ICC values were 0.95 for PSV, 0.87 for TAMX, and 0.67 for both PI and RI. The variability between measurements, as per Bland-Altman plots, was small for PSV, TAMX, and RI and acceptable for PI. For reliability after the PFM contractions task, ICC values were 0.85 for PSV, 0.77 for TAMX, 0.79 for PI, and 0.81 for RI. The variability between measurements was small for PSV and RI and acceptable for TAMX and PI. EDV parameter did not perform as well in both conditions. Assessment of the clitoral blood flow with color Doppler ultrasound is reliable at rest and after a PFM contraction task."
29953673," This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary phytoncides extracted from discarded Korean pine cones (Pinus koraiensis) on the performance, egg quality, immune response and gut microflora in laying hens. A total of 400 Hy-Line brown laying hens (50-week old) were allotted into four dietary treatments including a control diet or a diet supplemented with phytoncides at 0.002%, 0.004% and 0.008%. During the 6 weeks of experimental feeding, 0.008% of dietary phytoncides improved egg production, feed conversion ratio (p < 0.05), but not feed intake, egg weight or feed efficiency. Although dietary phytoncides had no effect on egg quality, decreases in Haugh units depending on storage periods were improved by 0.008% of dietary phytoncides (p < 0.05). To investigate the roles of dietary phytoncides on the alteration of the immune response during inflammation, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline was intraperitoneally injected into 10 hens per diet group on the end date of the experimental feeding period. Serum immunoglobulins and splenic cytokine expression at mRNA levels were then measured at 4 hr postinjection. Although the levels of IgA were decreased by LPS injection in all dietary groups, dietary phytoncides at 0.008% showed a higher level of IgA by LPS (p < 0.05). Interestingly, although LPS injection resulted in an enhanced expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6, dietary phytoncides at 0.008% showed less increased levels of them (p < 0.05). Gut microflora was examined from 10 hens per diet group at the end of the experimental period. While the number of Lactobacillus spp. was increased (p < 0.05), Escherichia coli counts in the cecal contents were decreased by 0.008% of dietary phytoncides. Taken together, these results demonstrate that dietary supplementation of 0.008% phytoncides improved the egg production, immune responses during inflammation and gut microflora in laying hens."
29953672," Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) was initially identified as an oncogenic transcription factor, and multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that FOXM1 is abundantly expressed and plays an irreplaceable role in several types of human cancers. Also, evidence has shown the association of FOXM1 with gastric carcinoma metastasis and patients prognosis; however, the potential role and molecular mechanism of FOXM1 in gastric cancer cell apoptosis are still obscure. The current study indicates that FOXM1 is highly expressed in a variety of gastric carcinoma cell lines, such as BGC823, MGC803, AGS, and SGC-7901, compared with the normal gastric mucosal epithelial cell lines CES-1. FOXM1 silence markedly inhibits AGS and SGC-7901 cell survival and proliferation, increases their apoptosis, and modulates apoptosis-related protein expression, including reduced Bcl-2 level and increased Bax and caspase-3 levels. Further study showed that FOXM1 depletion induced cell autophagy through increasing the level of beclin-1 and decreasing the P62 expression. We next corroborated that FOXM1 silence abolished the expression of Sirtuin 7 (SIRT7) and increased the level of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Finally, our data documented that the SIRT7/mTOR/IGF2 pathway was involved in the function of FOXM1 in AGS cell growth and apoptosis. In conclusion, these results confirmed that FOXM1 is involved in gastric carcinoma progression via the SIRT7/mTOR/IGF2 pathway."
29953671," Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders in adults and elderly individuals, and as a result, the DNA methylation (DNAm) of the BDNF gene in peripheral tissues including blood has been extensively examined to develop a useful biomarker for psychiatric disorders. However, studies to date have not previously investigated the effect of age on DNAm of the BDNF gene in blood. In this context, we measured DNAm of 39 CpG units in the CpG island at the promoter of exon I of the BDNF gene. We analyzed genomic DNA from peripheral blood of 105 health Japanese women 20 to 80 years of age to identify aging-associated change in DNAm of the BDNF gene. In addition, we examined the relationship between total MMSE scores, numbers of stressful life events, and serum BDNF levels on DNAm of the BDNF gene. The DNAm rate at each CpG unit was measured using a MassArray There was a significant correlation between DNAm and age in 13 CpGs. However, there was no significant correlation between DNAm and total MMSE scores, numbers of life events, or serum BDNF levels. Despite the small number of subjects and the inclusion of only female subjects, our results suggest that DNAm of 13 CpGs of the BDNF gene may be an appropriate biomarker for aging and useful for predicting increased susceptibility to age-related psychiatric disorders."
29953670," Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for fracture independent of FRAX® probability. We directly compared four proposed methods to improve the performance of FRAX for type 2 diabetes: (1) the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) input to FRAX; (2) the trabecular bone score (TBS)-adjustment to FRAX; (3) reducing the femoral neck T-score input to FRAX by 0.5 SD; (4) increasing the age input to FRAX by 10 years. We examined major osteoporotic fractures (MOF) and hip fractures (HF) over mean 8.3 years observation among 44,543 women and men 40 years of age or older (4136 with diabetes) with baseline lumbar spine and hip DXA during 1999-2016. Controlled for unadjusted FRAX probability, diabetes was associated with increased risk for MOF and HF. All four FRAX adjustments attenuated the effect of diabetes, but a residual effect of diabetes was seen on MOF risk after TBS adjustment, and on HF risk after the RA and TBS adjustments. Among those with diabetes, unadjusted FRAX risk underestimated MOF (observed/predicted ratio 1.15, 95% CI 1.03-1.28) but this was no longer significant after applying the diabetes adjustments. HF risk was more severely underestimated (observed/predicted ratio 1.85, 95% CI 1.51-2.20) and was only partially corrected with the diabetes adjustments (still significant for the RA and TBS adjustments). Among those with diabetes there was moderate reclassification based upon a fixed MOF cutoff of 20% (4.1-7.1%) or fixed HF cutoff of 3% (5.7-16.5%). Net reclassification improvement (NRI) increased for MOF with each of the diabetes adjustments (range 3.9-5.6% in the diabetes subgroup). In conclusion, each of the proposed methods for addressing limitations in the ability of FRAX to assess fracture risk in individuals with diabetes was found to improve performance, though no single method was optimal in all settings.

29953669," Ethnicity, skin phototype and colour influenced minimal erythema dose (MED). Sun exposure has been postulated to increase MED. We determined immediate pigment darkening dose to UVA (IPDDA), MED and minimal melanogenic dose (MMD) for UVB and UVA, and investigated factors affecting these doses. Skin phototype was determined using Fitzpatrick phototype quiz, DSMII ColorMeter measured skin colours, sun exposure quantified using an index (SEI) and phototest performed with MEDlight-Multitester. A total of 167 healthy volunteers participated. There were 110(66%) females and 56(34%) males; 124(74.7%) were Malay, 27(16.3%) Chinese, 14(8.4%) Indians. One hundred and nine (65.7%) skin phototype IV, 30(18.1%) phototype III and 27(16.3%) phototype V. IPDDA ranges from 6±1.5 - 5.7±1.4 J/cm MEDs in our cohort were slightly different from other regional countries. Constitutive and facultative skin whiteness, erythema, and melanin content correlated with MED. There was no association between skin phototype and sun exposure with MED or MMD.

29953667," First described in 1961, photoonycholysis (PO) is a rare nail alteration that may result from drug intake, topical aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy or from photosensitive conditions such as porphyria or pseudoporphyria. Spontaneous PO is rare. This review updates the numerous causes of PO and highlights some new ways producing this condition. Four different types of PO are clearly recognized without relationship with the responsible drug. An updated list of potential inducing drug is provided. Some practical points on PO have been raised. The inability to reproduce photoonycholysis experimentally should be emphasized and the pathogenesis of PO still needs to be clarified. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
29953666," Patients who have successfully acquired the intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) technique can be expected to use it on a long-term basis. The aim of the present study is to present a validated evaluation scale, referred to as the ICAS (Intermittent Catheterization Adherence Scale), which can be used to assess long-term patient adherence to prescribed ISC treatment. The scale was validated in neurologic and non neurologic patients in an experienced French neurourology center, between September 2014 and February 2016. Eight items were chosen, providing a relatively objective insight into the degree to which patients reduce the frequency of their ISC procedures. Various factors, including the patients' understanding of the procedure, its relevance to their specific condition, as well as their acceptance of its psychological and inherently time-consuming drawbacks, were evaluated. The ISC construct validity and reproducibility, based on internal test-retest consistency and test-retest reliability, were measured using the Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC). The ICAS was validated in 222 patients (133 females, 89 males, mean age 53 ± 11 years). The patients' comprehension of the questions was found to be good, and the questionnaire was well accepted. Cronbach's alpha was 0.73. The ICC test-retest consistency was also found to be good. The ICAS is a simple, acceptable, valid and reproducible test, and in some cases it may facilitate the medical follow-up of ISC patients. In the clinical environment, it is found to be a valuable tool, which can assist medical staff in the prevention of complications related to ISC non-compliance."
29953665," Accumulating evidence suggests that autophagy plays a protective role in chondrocytes and prevents cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis (OA). The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of diazoxide on chondrocyte death and cartilage degeneration and to determine whether these effects are correlated to autophagy in experimental OA. In this study, a cellular OA model was established by stimulating SW1353 cells with interleukin 1β. A rat OA model was generated by transecting the anterior cruciate ligament combined with the resection of the medial menisci, followed by treatment with diazoxide or diazoxide combination with 3-methyladenine. The percentage of viable cells was evaluated using calcein-acetoxymethyl/propidium iodide double staining. The messenger RNA expression levels of collagen type II alpha 1 chain (COL2A1), matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP-1), and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5 (ADAMTS5) were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The cartilage thickness and joint space were evaluated using ultrasound. SW1353 cell degeneration and autophagosomes were observed using transmission electron microscopy. The expression levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), beclin-1, P62, COL2A1, and MMP-13 were evaluated using immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis. Diazoxide significantly attenuated articular cartilage degeneration and SW1353 cell death in experimental OA. The restoration of autophagy was observed in the diazoxide-treated group. The beneficial effects of diazoxide were markedly blocked by 3-methyladenine. Diazoxide treatment also modulated the expression levels of OA-related biomarkers. These results demonstrated that diazoxide exerted a chondroprotective effect and attenuated cartilage degeneration by restoring autophagy via modulation of OA-related biomarkers in experimental OA. Diazoxide treatment might be a promising therapeutic approach to prevent the development of OA."
29953664," Randomized controlled trials are the bedrock of evidence-based medicine (EBM). They avoid the major pitfalls of anecdotal evidence, conscious and unconscious bias in patient selection and outcome assessments. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have revolutionized our knowledge of the efficacy and safety of medicines across all aspects of health care. They are now even being applied to surgical interventions."
29953663," This study assessed the cost consciousness of nurses and physicians in German neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and identified factors affecting cost consciousness. This study on cost-consciousness was part of the German Safety4NICU study, a cross-sectional survey conducted from 2015 to 2016. All 224 German NICUs were invited to take part in the survey and written consent was obtained from the leading physicians and nurses. The various professions were addressed via specific questionnaires. The cost survey tool identified the participant's responsibility and their desired focus on cost consciousness. Of the 1,406 nurses and 496 physicians from 84 NICUs, 64.4% of the nurses and 62.5% of the physicians agreed that they shared responsibility for controlling costs. The computed score to define the overall cost-consciousness level was 4.47. We identified a significantly positive association between cost consciousness, longer total clinical work experience and a decreased number of NICU intensive care beds. Increased cost-consciousness was found in both men and physicians. Other hospital characteristics did not have an effect. Neonatology is a medical specialty where the tension between economics and the benefit of patients is extremely high. We found a moderate level of cost consciousness among NICU physicians and nurses.

29953662," We examined the associations between late preterm (LPT) birth children aged ≥5 years and the frequency of bedwetting. Moreover, those who were born full term/low birth weight (BW), LPT/low BW, LPT/normal BW, and LPT/low BW were compared. In total, we evaluated 614 patients who underwent assessments for frequent bedwetting at the three hospitals from January 2014 to December 2016. Data at the initial visit were collected from the electronic medical records. We assessed the patients' bladder diaries and questionnaires containing detailed information on demographics and frequency of bedwetting per month. Neonatal data were collected from the Maternal and Child Health Handbook. Frequency of bedwetting in the LPT/low BW group was higher than in the term/low BW group (28 vs. 22.5, p < 0.05). However, the frequency between the LPT/normal BW group and the LPT/low BW group was not significantly different (28 vs. 28, p = 1.00). Multiple regression analyses were conducted to eliminate potential confounding factors, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and intellectual disability, but results were not changed. This study revealed that LPT/low BW was associated with increased frequency of bedwetting in children. The results suggest that gestational age should be considered when examining patients with severe bedwetting. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
29953661," This study described the steps needed to achieve full oral feeding before discharge in a group of very and extremely preterm infants. We analysed the effects of oral feeding skills on discharge timing and on weight gain during their neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay. A prospective cross-sectional observational study of 100 infants who were less than 32 weeks of gestation (GA) was conducted at the Division of Neonatology, Graz, Austria, from March 2014 to February 2015. Patients were stratified into two groups: those who were less than 28 weeks at birth and those who were 28 weeks and over. Velocity of oral feeding skills attainment and weight gain were analysed. All infants successfully acquired oral feeding skills during hospitalisation. The median GA at which full oral feeding skills were reached was 37+1 weeks in extremely preterm and 34+5 weeks in very preterm infants. More immature neonates showed worse feeding performances and lower weight increments during oral feeding steps. Our study confirmed the role of GA in the development of oral feeding skills in the most premature babies. It also raises the question of whether expected daily weight gain should be targeted according to GA. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
29953660," Stakeholders from around the world came together to address the unmet needs of underactive bladder (UAB) at the 3rd International Congress for Underactive Bladder. The main recommendation from the regulatory working group is a need for a meeting of UAB stakeholders and regulatory agencies including the FDA to discuss guidance for regulatory trial design for devices, drugs, and/or biologics for UAB. The following issues to be discussed and agreed upon for UAB trials: 1) Appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria. 2) Should residual urine volume be the primary outcome parameter and how often should it be measured? 3) Are there secondary measures that should have a place in UAB trials, such as change in the number of catheterizations, quality of life measures, etc.? 4) Use and format of bladder voiding and catheterization diary for trials. 5) Define role and technique of urodynamics in UAB trials. Are urodynamics required to monitor, and possibly exclude, individuals with high pressure voiding induced by bladder prokinetic therapies? 6) Development and use of UAB questionnaires. The UAB regulatory working group recognizes the path forward should include engaging the FDA and other regulatory organizations that may harmonize and formalize guidance for regulatory trial designs for therapeutics for UAB."
29953657," The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the impact of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) on work productivity in female workers. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using eight electronic databases (MEDLINE, PEDro, CINAHL, Cochrane library, EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO) to identify articles published before July 2017 that studied the work productivity in female workers with LUTS. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute. Meta-analyses were performed on studies having measured work productivity between females with and without LUTS, and odds ratios (ORs) or the mean differences were used. Fourteen articles (n = 48 223 females) were included in the review, and meta-analyses were performed with six of those articles. Lower urinary tract symptoms were significantly associated with work productivity loss (OR = 1.11, 95%CI = 1.06-1.15), presenteeism (OR = 1.10, 95%CI = 1.05-1.14), and activity impairment (OR = 1.11, 95%CI = 1.09-1.14). However, there was no significant difference in the probability of absenteeism between females with and without LUTS (OR = 1.03, 95%CI = 0.94-1.13). Evidence suggests that female workers with LUTS had significantly greater work productivity impairment compared to those without LUTS."

29953655," There is some controversy as for the roles played by tumor growth factor-β (TGF-β), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-22 in the onset process of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The main aim of this project was to examine serum levels of TGF-β, IL-1β, and IL-22 in the new cases and long period T2D patients as well as healthy controls. In this study, 115 new T2D patient cases (group 1), 434 T2D patients who have suffered from the disease more than 2 years (group 2), and 104 healthy controls have been selected from 6240 (3619 females) patients who were under study population from Kerman Coronary Artery Disease Risk Factor Study. Serum levels of TGF-β, IL-1β, and IL-22 have been evaluated using commercial kits. Serum levels of TGF-β and IL-1β significantly increased, while IL-22 decreased in 2 groups in comparison to healthy controls. Serum levels of IL-22, but not TGF-β and IL-1β, were significantly decreased in group 1 in comparison to healthy controls. There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 as for the cytokine levels. Serum levels of IL-22 increased in the females in group 2 when compared to females in group 1. It appears that TGF-β and IL-1β participate in the induction of inflammation after establishment of T2D, while decrease in IL-22 may be considered as a key factor for onset of the disease. Gender can also be considered as the main risk factor for variation in cytokine levels."
29953654," Repair of large soft tissue defects in meningomyelocele is difficult and its morbidity is high. By applying unilateral lumbar artery perforator transposition flap for closing these defects, we aimed to investigate effects on the repair procedure, duration of surgery and recovery period, with the rates of bleeding and morbidity. Our report was conducted in 38 patients between the years 2013 and 2017. All soft tissue defects were repaired with unilateral lumbar artery perforator flap (LAPF) in meningomyelocele. Fourteen patients were female and 24 patients were male. The youngest patient was a 5.5 month premature female baby and weighing 570 g. The oldest was weighing 3,700 g and at 1.5 months old. Mean flap size was 32 ± 29.4 cm As a result, unilateral lumbar perforator flap can be performed successfully in every center. This report suggests using LAPF for reconstruction of meningomyelocele by surgeons as a safe and reliable option, allowing surgeons strong results."
29953653," Interaction between tumor and stromal cells is beginning to be decoded as a contributor to chemotherapy resistance. Here, we aim to take a system-level approach to explore a mechanism by which stromal cells induce chemoresistance in cancer cells and subsequently identify a drug that can inhibit such interaction. Using a proteomic dataset containing quantitative data on secretome of stromal cells, we performed multivariate analyses and found that bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) play the most protective role against chemotherapeutics. Pathway enrichment tests showed that secreted cytokines from BM-MSCs activated 4 signaling pathways including Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B, and mitogen-activated protein kinase, transforming growth factor-β in cancer cells collectively leading to nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) transcription factor activation. Based on the data from integrated Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (iLINCs) program, we found that among different drugs, valproic acid (VA) affected the expression of 34 genes within the identified pathways that are activated by stromal cells. Our in vitro experiments confirmed that VA inhibits NF-kB activation in cancer cells. In addition, analyzing gene expression data in patients taking oral VA showed that this drug decreased expression of antioxidant enzymes culminating in increased oxidative stress in tumor cells. These results suggest that VA confines the protective role of stromal cells by inhibiting the adaptation mechanisms toward oxidative stress which is potentiated by stromal cells. Since VA is an already prescribed drug manifesting anticancer effects, this study provides a mechanistic insight for combination of VA with chemotherapy in the clinical setting."
29953651," Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a severe problem patients diagnosed with acute limb ischemia. Recently, microRNAs (miR) have emerged as regulators of IRI as well as ischemic preconditioning and ischemic postconditioning. Therefore, using rat models, this study aims to explore all of the possible mechanisms that miR-19 exhibits with its relation to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β1)/Smad signaling pathway in the lower limb IRI. An immunofluorescence staining method was used to identify the Krueppel-like factor 10 (KLF10) positive expression and the location of KLF10 expression. The targeting relationship that miR-19 has with KLF10 was verified by the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Vascular endothelial cells (VECs) were treated with elevated or suppressed miR-19 or KLF10 knockdown. A 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was used to test cell proliferation, and flow cytometry was employed to detect both cell cycle and apoptosis. The KLF10-positive expression in the VECs (both in cytoplasm and nucleus) was found to be elevated in the IRI rats. We found that miR-19 was downregulated, KLF10 upregulated, and the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway activated in the vascular epithelial tissues of IRI rats. KLF10 is a target gene of miR-19. Overexpression of miR-19 decreased the expression of KLF10, TGF-β1, and Smad2/3. Decreased miR-19 inhibited VEC proliferation, arrested VECs at the G1 phase, and promoted the apoptosis of VECs following their lower limb I/R injury. These results indicate miR-19 as being an inhibitor in the VEC injury of IRI via the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway by suppression of KLF10."
29953650," Open surgery is the most commonly used methodological approach for generating a partial bladder outlet obstruction (pBOO) animal model. Surgical suturing closing a part of the urethral meatus induces comparable pathophysiological changes in bladder and renal functions, but the optimum degree of obstruction that closely mimics the clinical pathology of pBOO has not been elucidated. We investigated the optimum obstruction level by performing a comprehensive time-dependent analysis of the stability and reliability of this novel animal model. Six- to eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were divided into three groups according to the degree of urethral meatus stricture (UMS). Non-operated mice served as controls, and a pBOO model generated using the traditional method served as a positive control. A cystometric evaluation and long-term studies were performed to evaluate the validity and reliability of this novel animal model. An additional 35 mice were used to investigate the protein expression levels and histopathological features 24 h and 14 days postoperatively, respectively. The characteristic cystometry features in the UMS group revealed increased changes in pressure-related parameters compared with the control. The 1/3 UMS model is an optional pBOO animal model because the cystometric evaluation and histopathological studies revealed a striking resemblance between the 1/3 UMS model and the model generated using the traditional open-surgery method. The minimally invasive UMS model required less time and produced minimal alterations in pathophysiologically relevant processes compared with the traditional surgery model. Suturing to cause UMS produced effective and repeatable patterns in bladder function investigations in mice."
29953649," Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating and highly aggressive tumor, which is apoptosis resistant and difficult to cure. Recently, long noncoding RNAs have been shown to play a pivotal role in GBM progression. Evidence has suggested that retinal noncoding RNA3 (RNCR3) is a GBM-associated noncoding RNA and is under-expressed in GBM. However, the function and mechanism of RNCR3 on GBM cell growth and apoptosis are still uncertain. In the current study, we found that the level of RNCR3 is decreased in U87, U251, U373, and A172 GBM cell lines when compared with the normal human astrocytes. Elevating long noncoding RNA RNCR3 expression markedly inhibits U87 and U251 cell survival and proliferation. Further studies indicated that RNCR3 overexpression promotes U87 and U251 cell apoptosis and activity caspase-3/7. Moreover, we found that RNCR3 overexpression promotes Krüppel-like factor 16 (KLF16) expression through inhibiting the level of miR-185-5p. We demonstrated that KLF16 is a direct target of miR-185-5p. An increased miR-185-5p level by a miR-185-5p mimic or decreased KLF16 by KLF16 small interfering RNA both reversed the function of RNCR3 overexpression on GBM cell growth and apoptosis. In summary, this study focuses on investigating the key molecular mechanisms of RNCR3 involved in GBM cell growth and apoptosis. Our data indicated that RNCR3 overexpression inhibits cell growth and induces its apoptosis through the miR-185-5p/KLF16 axis."
29953648," Previous studies have demonstrated that the recombinant Schistosoma japonicum protein P40 (rSjP40) could inhibit activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) through the TGF-β1/Smads signaling pathway. Since multiple microRNAs could play essential roles in HSC activation and in the process of hepatic fibrosis through targeting Smads, we attempted to seek the potential microRNAs that could be involved in rSjP40-induced inhibition of HSC activation. Using the method of quantitative real-time PCR, we found that rSjP40 could induce miR-146a expression in LX-2 cells. The down-regulated expression levels of Smad4 and α-SMA in LX-2 cells induced by rSjP40 were partially restored by an miR-146a inhibitor. miR-146a can be involved in rSjP40-induced inhibition of HSC activation through targeting Smad4. These findings provide us a new idea to explore the potential mechanisms by which rSjP40 could regulate the process of hepatic fibrosis."
29953647," Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNA molecules involved in regulation of post-translational gene expression. Although aberrant levels of miRNAs have been found in various tumor tissues, their importance in tumor development and the molecular basis of their regulatory role remain unclear. Our bioinformatic analysis on The Cancer Genome Atlas database and microarray-based comparison of miRNA in different cell lines revealed that the level of mir-1287 is suppressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. When upregulated, mir-1287 can reduce the tumorigenesis phenotypes of HCC cells in several in vitro models. We further found that mir-1287 directly targets messenger RNA encoding PIK3R3, which is a tumor-promoting factor acting in several pathways linked to tumorigenesis. Our study suggests that aberrant suppression of mir-1287 is potentially responsible for the development of HCC, and miRNA-based strategies may be developed for efficient detection and treatment of HCC."
29953646," Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a global public health problem. Despite the major milestone in early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer, the prevalence of CRC rates is still rising. The etiology of CRC is still unknown but we know CRC is influenced by both of environment and genetic factors. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of vitamin D receptor gene polymorphic regions; FokI and TaqI single nucleotide polymorphisms, in increasing the risk of colorectal cancer in Birjand population. One hundred patients with CRC and 100 healthy controls recruited to the study. Genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) method technique for all individuals. There were statistically significant differences between ff genotype and f allele of FokI SNP in case and control groups. Our results manifested positive correlation between ff genotype and f allele of FokI SNP with colorectal cancer predisposition (P = 0.035, P = 0.0001 respectively) in South Khorasan population. The present study showed that FokI polymorphism but not TaqI polymorphism may contribute to CRC susceptibility. In addition, ff genotype of FokI polymorphism was associated with CRC risk."
29953645," Long noncoding RNAs play essential roles in cancer development and progression. Here, we tried to investigate the role of GIHCG in the progression and metastasis of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC). In our study, we showed that that the expression level of GIHCG was upregulated in TSCC tissues and cell lines. In addition, we indicated that high GIHCG expression was positively associated with poor overall survival. Moreover, ectopic expression of GIHCG enhanced TSCC cell cycle, proliferation, and migration. Elevated expression of GIHCG inhibited the miR-429 expression in TSCC cells. We demonstrated that the expression level of miR-429 was lower in TSCC tissues and cell lines. Low miR-429 expression was positively associated with poor overall survival. We then determined the correlation between miR-429 and GIHCG expression levels. A statistically significantly inverse correlation was observed between miR-429 and GIHCG expression levels in TSCC tissues. In addition, overexpression of miR-429 suppressed the TSCC cell cycle, proliferation, and migration. Elevated expression of GIHCG promoted TSCC cell cycle, proliferation, and migration through regulating miR-429 expression. These results suggested that GIHCG increased TSCC progression through negative modulation of miR-429. Our results suggested that GIHCG/miR-429 might play a vital role in TSCC progression."
29953644," To test a kind of stretch pattern which is the optimum stress parameter to promote human urothelial cells (HUCs) proliferation, and to investigate the roles of integrin subunits and their pathway in the HUCs proliferation induced by physiological stretch. HUCs were seeded on silicone membrane, and subjected to four kinds of stretch (0,5%,10%,15% elongation) for 24 h, as controlled by a BioDynamic The proliferation of HUCs were highest in the 5% elongation group compared to static control, 10% and 15% elongation group. RT-PCR and western blot showed that 5% cyclic stretch significantly promoted the expression of integrin α6 and FAK. The stretch-induced cell proliferation and FAK expression was inhibited by siRNA of integrin α6. Further study with FAK inhibitor revealed that elongation promoted proliferation though integrin α6 and FAK signaling pathway. Physiological stretch induced HUCs proliferation via integrin α6-FAK signaling pathway, and 5% elongation may be the optimal stress parameter to promote the cell proliferation."
29953643," Recent data suggest that antidepressants are associated with incident diabetes but the possible pharmacological mechanism is still questioned. The aim of the present study was to evaluate antidepressant's risk for reporting diabetes using disproportionality analysis of the FDA adverse events spontaneous reporting system (FAERS) database and to investigate possible receptor/transporter mechanisms involved. Data from 2004 to 2017 were analyzed using OpenVigil2 and adjusted reporting odds ratio (aROR) for reporting diabetes was calculated for 22 antidepressants. Events included in the narrow scope of the SMQ ""hyperglycemia/new onset diabetes mellitus"" were defined as cases and all the other events as non-cases. The pharmacodynamic profile was extracted using the PDSP and IUPHAR/BPS databases and the occupancy on receptors (serotonin, alpha adrenoreceptors, dopamine, muscarinic, histamine) and transporters (SERT, NET, DAT) was estimated. The relationship between aROR for diabetes and receptor occupancy was investigated with Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) and univariate linear regression. Six antidepressants were associated with diabetes: nortriptyline with aROR [95% CI] of 2.01 [1.41-2.87], doxepin 1.97 [1.31-2.97], imipramine 1.82 [1.09-3.06], sertraline 1.47 [1.29-1.68], mirtazapine 1.33 [1.04-1.69] and amitriptyline 1.31 [1.09-1.59]. Strong positive correlation coefficients between occupancy and aROR for diabetes were identified for the receptors M Most of the tricyclic antidepressants, mirtazapine and sertraline seem to be associated with reporting diabetes in FAERS. Higher degrees of occupancy on muscarinic receptors and H"
29953642," Myelin sheath is critical for the proper functioning of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which allows the effective conduction of nerve impulses. Fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) is an autocrine and paracrine protein in the fibroblast growth factor family that regulates cell differentiation and proliferation. Fgf9 Schwann cell (SC) conditional knockout mice were developed to detect the role of FGF9 in the PNS. In our study, the absence of Fgf9 led to delayed myelination in early development. The expression of mature SC-related genes decreased, and the expression of genes associated with immature SCs increased in the Fgf9 knockout mice. These data were consistent with the morphology and praxeology we observed during the development of the peripheral nerves. Extracellular-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) are key signals for myelination, and our results showed that Fgf9 ablation led to the inactivation of ERK1/2. Further research was performed to detect the role of FGF9 in peripheral nerve injury. In superoxide dismutase 1-G93A mice with Fgf9 SC knockout, we found that Fgf9 ablation inhibited the expressions of Cd68, Il-1β, and Cd86, which contributed to the degeneration of the axon and myelin sheath."
29953641," Despite widespread use of behavioral observations to evaluate child feeding behaviors in research and clinical practice, few studies have comprehensively characterized mealtimes or identified features that differentiate children with and without disordered feeding; these were the aims of the current study. Mealtime observations were conducted for 18 children with avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and 21 typically developing children. Observations were coded inductively, and associations between disorder and observed mealtime actions were examined. Most behaviors were observed across both clinical and nonclinical mealtimes, and many did not differ in frequency between children with and without ARFID. However, significant group differences were observed in the frequencies of behaviors relating to food intake, visual and physical engagement with feeding, and movement during mealtimes. The comparability of behaviors across clinical and nonclinical groups suggests that eating behaviors exist on a continuum from ""normal"" to ""abnormal,"" with group differences relating to frequency rather than type of behavior. The behavioral differences observed in this study suggest that identification of children with ARFID should focus on child engagement with food and restlessness during mealtimes. Reliance on emotional and escape-maintained behaviors will lead to underrecognition of families in need of clinical support."
29953638," The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system regulates fetoplacental growth and plays a role in disease programming. Dysregulation of the IGF-system is implicated in several pregnancy perturbations associated with altered fetal growth, including intrauterine growth restriction and maternal obesity. Limited human studies have demonstrated that maternal exercise enhances fetoplacental growth and decreases cord IGF ligands, which may restore the placental IGF-system in complicated pregnancies. This study investigated the impact maternal exercise has on the placental IGF-system in placentae from mothers born growth restricted and if these outcomes are dependent on maternal diet or fetal sex. Uteroplacental insufficiency (Restricted) or sham (Control) surgery was induced on embryonic day (E) 18 in Wistar-Kyoto rats. F1 offspring were fed a Chow or High-fat diet from weaning, and at 16 weeks were randomly allocated an exercise protocol; Sedentary, Exercised prior to and during pregnancy (Exercise), or Exercised during pregnancy only (PregEx). Females were mated (20 weeks) with placentae associated with F2 fetuses collected at E20. The placental IGF-system mRNA abundance and placental morphology was altered in mothers born growth restricted. Exercise increased fetal weight and Control plasma IGF1 concentrations, and decreased female placental weight. PregEx did not influence fetoplacental growth but increased placental IGF1 and IGF1R (potentially modulated by reduced Let 7f-1 miRNA) and decreased placental IGF2 protein. Importantly, these placental IGF-system changes occurred with sex-specific responses. These data highlight that exercise differently influences fetoplacental growth and the placental IGF-system depending on maternal exercise initiation, which may prevent the transgenerational transmission of deficits and dysfunction.

29953637," Increasing evidence indicates that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) perform special biological functions by regulating gene expression through multiple pathways and molecular mechanisms. The aim of this study was to explore the expression characteristics of lncRNA uc.322 in pancreatic islet cells and its effects on the secretion function of islet cells. Bioinformatics analysis was used to detect the lncRNA uc.322 sequence, location, and structural features. Expression of lncRNA uc.322 in different tissues was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, adenosine triphosphate determination, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to evaluate the effects of lncRNA uc.322 on insulin secretion. The results showed that the full-length of lncRNA uc.322 is 224 bp and that it is highly conserved in various species. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that lncRNA uc.322 is located on chr7:122893196-122893419 (GRCH37/hg19) within the SRY-related HMG-box 6 gene exon region. Compared with other tissues, lncRNA uc.322 is highly expressed in pancreatic tissue. Upregulation of lncRNA uc.322 expression increases the insulin transcription factors pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 and Forkhead box O1 expression, promotes insulin secretion in the extracellular fluid of Min6 cells, and increases the adenosine triphosphate concentration. On the other hand, knockdown of lncRNA uc.322 has opposite effects on Min6 cells. Overall, this study showed that upregulation of lncRNA uc.322 in islet β-cells can increase the expression of insulin transcription factors and promote insulin secretion, and it may be a new therapeutic target for diabetes."
29953636," Dogs were domesticated by human and originated from wolves. Their evolutionary relationships have attracted much scientific interest due to their genetic affinity but different habitats. To identify the differences between dogs and wolves associated with domestication, we analysed the blood transcriptomes of wolves and dogs by RNA-Seq. We obtained a total of 30.87 Gb of raw reads from two dogs and three wolves using RNA-Seq technology. Comparisons of the wolf and dog transcriptomes revealed 524 genes differentially expressed genes between them. We found that some genes related to immune function (DCK, ICAM4, GAPDH and BSG) and aerobic capacity (HBA1, HBA2 and HBB) were more highly expressed in the wolf. Six differentially expressed genes related to the innate immune response (CCL23, TRIM10, DUSP10, RAB27A, CLEC5A and GCH1) were found in the wolf by a Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. Immune system development was also enriched only in the wolf group. The ALAS2, HMBS and FECH genes, shown to be enriched by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, were associated with the higher aerobic capacity and hypoxia endurance of the wolf. The results suggest that the wolf might have greater resistance to pathogens, hypoxia endurance and aerobic capacity than dogs do."
29953635," Active coping is an adaptive stress response that improves outcomes in medical and neuropsychiatric diseases. To date, most research into coping style has focused on neurotransmitter activity and little is known about the intrinsic excitability of neurons in the associated brain regions that facilitate coping. Previous studies have shown that HCN channels regulate neuronal excitability in pyramidal cells and that HCN channel current (I"
29953634," To evaluate endo-sinus new bone formation and implant osseointegration after transalveolar sinus floor elevation (TSFE) and simultaneous implant placement without any grafting materials, and to investigate the influence of implant surface modification on bone healing process under this circumstance. TSFE and simultaneous implant placement was conducted bilaterally on 12 labrador dogs. No grafting materials were used during surgery. Implants with two different surfaces (SLA and SLActive) were placed in a split-mouth design. The animals were sacrificed 4, 8 and 24 weeks after surgery for histologic and histomorphometric assessements. Bone-to-implant contact (BIC%), alveolar bone height (ABH) and the percentages of mineralized bone (MB%) in the area of interest were analyzed. The probing depth (PD) and bleeding on probing (BOP) were also assessed to describe peri-implant health conditions. Sprouts of new bone in direct contact with implant surface were seen in the elevated area at every time point. Newly-formed woven bone under sinus membrane was visible. SLActive implants exhibited favorable results compared with SLA implants regarding ABH at 4 weeks, BIC% at 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Sites with BOP positive could be observed in both groups at any time point. No newly-formed bone can be found on the implant apex with either SLA or SLActive surfaces at any time point. Spontaneous new bone formation from the parent bone walls could be observed after TFE without any grafting materials. No clear evidence of bone formation from the Schneiderian membrane could be found. Even though there were trends for quicker bone response of SLActive implants, this study failed to show the absolute advantage of SLActive in achieving endo-sinus bone formation.

29953633," Microalgae have emerged as promising biosorbents for the treatment of malachite green in wastewater. However, the underlying mechanism for the biosorption of malachite green onto microalgae is still unclear and needs further intensive study. In this work, synchrotron Fourier-transform infrared (synchrotron-FTIR) microspectroscoy in combination with biochemical assay is employed to evaluate malachite green removal efficiency (95.2%, 75.6% and 66.5%) by three stages of Haematococcus pluvialis. Meanwhile, the various vital changes of algal cells including lipids, proteins, polysaccharides and carotenoids, is distinguished and quantified in situ. This study illustrates that synchrotron-FTIR microspectroscopy is an effective and powerful tool to scrutinize the mechanism for the interactions between the malachite green dye and microalgal cells and it even provides an effective and none-invasive new approach to screen potentially proper biosorbents for the removal of dyes from wastewater.

29953632," The theory of social representations (TSR) and discursive psychology (DP) originated as different social psychological approaches and have at times been presented as incompatible. However, along the years convergence has also been acknowledged, and, lately, most of all, practised. With this paper, we discuss how versions of TSR focusing on self-other relations for examining cultural meaning systems in/through communication, and versions of DP focusing on discourse at cultural, ideological, and interactional levels, can come together. The goal is to help forge a stronger social-psychological exploration of how meaning is constructed and transformed in and through language, discourse, and communication, thus extending current understanding of social change. After presenting a theoretical proposal for integrating those versions of TSR and DP, we offer also an integrated analytical strategy. We suggest that together these proposals can, on one hand, help TSR systematize analyses of social change that are both more critical and better grounded in theorizations of language use, and, on the other, provide DP with analytical tools able to better examine both the relational contexts where the construction and transformation of meaning are performed and their effects on discourse. Finally, we give some illustrations of the use of this analytical strategy."
29953631," There has been a resurgence in interest and use of the Cannabis plant for medical purposes. However, an in-depth understanding of plant contaminants and toxins effects on; stability of plant compounds and human bioavailability is needed. This systematic review aims to assess current understanding of the contaminants of Cannabis and their effect on human health, leading to the identification of knowledge gaps for future investigation. A systematic search of seven indexed biological and biomedical databases and the Cochrane library was undertaken from inception up to December 2017. A qualitative synthesis of filtered results was undertaken after independent assessment for eligibility by two reviewers. The common Cannabis contaminants includes; microbes, heavy metals and pesticides. Their direct human toxicity is poorly quantified but include infection, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental impacts. Cannabis dosing formulations and administration routes affect the transformation and bioavailability of contaminants. There may be important pharmacokinetic interactions between the alkaloid active ingredients of Cannabis (i.e. phytocannabinoids) and contaminants but these are not yet identified nor quantified. There is significant paucity in the literature describing the prevalence and human impact of Cannabis contaminants. Advances in the availability of Cannabis globally warrant further research in this area, particularly when being used for patients."
29953630," Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) in the septum close to the atrioventricular node (AVN) or His bundle has an increased risk of irreversible complications. Cryothermal energy has the advantages of reversible cryomapping and increased catheter stability. The study aims at evaluating the efficacy and safety of cryoablation of the right anteroseptal or midseptal accessory pathways (APs) in pediatric patients. A retrospective review was performed with 26 pediatric patients (16 males and 10 females; median age 6.0 years and average body weight 24.9 kg) with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) in our Pediatric Heart Center from 2014 to 2016. Half of them had manifest APs. All the children underwent cryoablation for the treatment of PSVT because of the right anteroseptal or midseptal APs (16 cases had right anteroseptal APs and 10 cases had right midseptal APs). Acute cryoablation success was achieved in 23 cases (88%, 23/26). Atrioventricular block (AVB) occurred in 8 cases (31%, 8/26) during the procedures and normal atrioventricular conduction recovered in 7 cases except a case with I°AVB. During follow-up, 3 cases recurred (13%, 3/23) and no permanent high degree AVB was found. Cryoablation of the right anteroseptal or midseptal APs in pediatric patients is both safe and effective.

29953629," Noninfectious pulmonary complications (NIPCs) frequently occur following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). As there is no consensus on the description of the related pulmonary pathological lesions, pathologist reports and clinical conclusions are largely inconsistent in routine practice. The aim of our study was to provide an accurate overview of post allogeneic HSCT NIPCs from a large number of lung biopsies. We reviewed 61 lung biopsies in patients with an NIPC, including 51 surgical lung biopsies, 4 post mortem biopsies and 6 lung explants. We found both bronchiolar (n=59) and alveolar/interstitial pathologies (n=27). We described two types of bronchiolar lesions: bronchiolectasies (n=37) and fibrous and cellular lesions with luminal narrowing (n=43). We found a wide spectrum of airway/interstitial pathologies that were labelled using terminology of the 2013 American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs), including the following: organizing pneumonia (OP, n=8), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP, n=9), diffuse alveolar damage (DAD, n=6), lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP, n=1) and pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE, n=2), as well as one instance of associated PPFE and NSIP. Interstitial pathology was associated with bronchiolar lesions in 41% of the reviewed cases (n=25). Lung airway and interstitial inflammation was still present in lung explants from patients who underwent lung transplantation for post allogeneic HSCT end-stage respiratory insufficiency. Herein, we describe a wide spectrum of pathological lung lesions encountered in post allogeneic HSCT NIPCs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
29953628," Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a rapidly growing field which offers high spatial resolution and high contrast for deep-tissue imaging in vivo. PAI is non-ionizing, non-invasive and combines the optical resolution of fluorescence imaging with the spatial resolution of ultrasound imaging. In particular, the development of exogenous PA contrast agents has gained significant momentum of late with a vastly expanding complexity of dye materials under investigation ranging from small molecules, to macromolecular proteins, polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles. The goal of this review is to survey the current state-of-the-art in molecular photoacoustic contrast agents (MPACs) for applications in biomedical imaging. The fundamental design principles of MPACs is presented and a review of prior reports spanning from early-to-current literature is put forth. This article is protected by copyright.

29953627," The current study addressed whether two institution-wide interventions in St. Petersburg, Russian Federation, that increased caregiver sensitivity (Training Only: TO) or both caregiver sensitivity and consistency (Training plus Structural Changes: T+SC) promoted better socioemotional and cognitive development than did a No Intervention (NoI) institution during the first year of life for children who were placed soon after birth. It also assessed whether having spent less than 9 versus 9 to 36 months with a family prior to institutionalization was related to children's subsequent socioemotional and cognitive development within these three institutions. The Battelle Developmental Inventory (J. Newborg, J.R. Stock, L. Wnek, J. Guidubaldi, & J. Svinicki, 1988) was used to assess the socioemotional and cognitive functioning of children in NoI (n = 95), TO (n = 104), and T+SC (n = 86) at two to three time points during their first 6 to 12 months of residency. Results suggest that improving caregiver sensitivity can improve the cognitive development of infants in the first year of institutionalization whereas improving caregiver consistency in addition to sensitivity is more beneficial for socioemotional development than is sensitivity alone. Similarly, for children in T+SC, longer time with a family prior to institutionalization (consistent caregiver, unknown sensitivity) was associated with better socioemotional, but not cognitive, baseline scores and more rapid cognitive than socioemotional development during institutionalization. These results suggest caregiver sensitivity is more highly related to cognitive development whereas caregiver consistency is more related to socioemotional development in the first years of life."
29953626," Symptoms of depression negatively impact on mother-infant relationships and child outcomes. We evaluated a novel, 10-session mother-infant therapeutic playgroup-Community HUGS (CHUGS)-which combines cognitive and experiential components through psychoeducation, play, music, and movement. Participants were mothers experiencing a range of postnatal mental health difficulties, including depression, with infants ≤12 months of age. However, the aim was not to treat maternal depression but to ameliorate associated problems in the mother-infant interaction. In the feasibility study, all participants received CHUGS. In the pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), participants were randomized between intervention and a wait-list. Outcomes were the Parenting Stress Index (PSI; R.R. Abidin, 1995), Parenting Sense of Competency Scale (Self-Efficacy subscale; J. Gibaud-Wallston & L.P. Wandersman, 1978), and the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales (P.F. Lovibond & S.H. Lovibond, 1995). In the feasibility study (n = 74), PSI scores dropped on all subscales, all ps < .01. Depression, p < .001, anxiety, p = .01, stress, p = .01, and self-efficacy, p < .001, all showed improvements, as did observer-rated mother-infant interactions, p < .001. In the RCT, depression, p < .001, anxiety, p = .005, and stress, p < .001, symptoms were significantly reduced for intervention participants (n = 16), as compared to wait-list participants (n = 15). The CHUGS program had high participant satisfaction and produced improvements in self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, stress, and mother-infant interactions that supported the program's acceptability and the utility of further rollout."
29953624," Atrial arrhythmias, particularly atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, can coexist with drug-induced type 1 Brugada ECG pattern (DI-Type1-BrP). The present study was designed to determine the prevalence of DI-Type1-BrP in patients with atrioventricular accessory pathways (AV-APs) and to investigate the clinical, electrocardiographic, electrophysiologic and genetic characteristics of these patients. One-hundred-twenty-four consecutive cases of AV-APs and 84 controls underwent an ajmaline challenge test to unmask DI-Type1-BrP. Genetic screening and analysis was performed in 55 of the cases (19 with and 36 without DI-Type1-BrP). Patients with AV-APs were significantly more likely than controls to have a Type1-BrP unmasked (16.1 versus 4.8%, p = 0.012). At baseline, patients with DI-Type1-BrP had higher prevalence of chest pain, QR/rSr' pattern in V DI-Type1-BrP is relatively common in patients with AV-APs. We identify 12-lead ECG characteristics during pre-excitation and orthodromic AVRT that point to an underlying type1-BrP, portending an increased probability for development of malignant arrhythmias.

29953623," The role of local surgical procedures in patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma is still undefined. Few retrospective studies have reported survival benefits for patients with pulmonary metastases after complete surgical resection. Treatment decisions are therefore mainly based on personal experiences rather than on reproducible knowledge. A total of 237 patients with metastatic sarcoma, treated between 1982 and 2015 at the University Hospital Tuebingen, Germany, were eligible for inclusion. Out of the 237 screened patients, 102 patients underwent at least one metastasectomy. Overall survival was defined as the primary endpoint in this study. For association of non-linear relationship to the endpoint, significant prognostic factors were included into a recursive partitioning model. A subgroup analysis for long-term survivors was also performed. The median overall survival was 64 months. The 3-, 5-, 10-, and 20-years overall survival rates were 70.7%, 50.3%, 24.7%, and 14.8%, respectively. The number of resections and the progression-free intervals were independent prognostic factors in three statistical models. Repeated resections of metastases from different localizations are a strong predictor for prolonged survival. We suggest that the progression-free interval after metastasectomy should be considered as a predictive factor for benefit from further surgery."
29953622," ERBB family cell surface receptors, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ERBB1), are phosphorylated upon binding by various EGF family ligands and signal via multiple kinase pathways. EGFR signaling is enhanced due to mutational activation of EGFR in almost half of glioblastomas, the most common malignant primary brain tumor. Therapeutic targeting of EGFR in glioblastoma has remained largely unsuccessful. Here we profiled 9 long-term (LTC) and 5 glioma-initiating (GIC) cell lines for expression and activation of ERBB family receptors and expression of their ligands. Receptors and ligands were abundantly expressed, with patterns overall similar to glioblastoma expression profiles in vivo as deposited in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. No differences between LTC and GIC emerged. Irrespective of ligand or receptor expression, neither an EGFR antibody, erbitux, nor an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), gefitinib, were particularly active against LTC or GIC at clinically relevant concentrations. Self-renewal capacity of GIC was severely compromised by EGF withdrawal, but rescued by transforming growth factor alpha (TGF- α), although not by neuregulin-1 (NRG-1). Subcellular fractionation indicated high levels of nuclear phosphorylated EGFR in all LTC and GIC. In LN-229 cells, pERBB2 and pERBB3 were also detected in the nucleus. Nuclear pERBB2 was less sensitive, whereas pERBB3 was induced, in response to gefitinib. This study provides an extensive characterization of human glioma cell models, including stem-like models, with regard to ERBB receptor/ligand expression and signaling. Redundant signaling involving multiple ERBB family ligands and receptors may contribute to the challenges of developing more effective EGFR-targeted therapies for glioblastoma.

29953621," Photothermal therapy (PTT) uses light absorbing materials to generate heat for treatment of diseases, like cancer. The advantages of using PTT components that absorb in the near-infrared (NIR) include reduced tissue auto-fluorescence and higher penetration depths. However, NIR laser light can still be scattered and absorbed by biological tissues, thus decreasing the amount of the energy reaching the PTT agents. We have developed two distinct formulations of NIR-absorbing nanoparticles, one which can be utilized for PTT only, and another for both PTT and fluorescence imaging of colorectal cancer. In this work, the fluorescence detection limit and the PTT heating potential of the two nanoparticle types were determined using alginate tissue phantoms. The objective of this study was to determine the PTT efficiency and theranostic potential of the nanoparticles by irradiating 3D collagen tumor spheroids, containing nanoparticles and CT26 mouse colorectal cancer cells, through increasing tissue phantom thicknesses and then quantifying cell death. Materials and Methods Our lab has previously developed nanoparticles based on the semiconducting, conjugated polymer poly[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole-4,7-diyl] (PCPDTBSe). We have also made a hybrid nanoparticle that heats and fluoresces by combining PCPDTBSe polymer with the fluorescent poly[(9,9-dihexylfluorene)-co-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-co-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole] (PFBTDBT10) polymer to yield nanoparticles termed Hybrid Donor-Acceptor Polymer Particles (H-DAPPs). H-DAPPs and PCPDTBSe nanoparticles were added to three-dimensional collagen gel tumor spheroids in order to represent nanoparticles in a tumor. Alginate tissue phantoms, comprised of an optical scattering agent (Intralipid) and an optical absorbing material (hemoglobin) in order to mirror biological tissue scattering effects, were used to simulate increasing tissue thickness between the nanoparticles and the PTT energy source. Fluorescence from the H-DAPPs was detectable through 6 mm of tissue phantoms. It was found that less than 10% of the laser energy could penetrate through 9 mm of tissue phantoms and only 60% of the laser energy passed through the 1.5 mm phantoms, regardless of laser power. PTT experiments, using 800 nm light at 2.2 W/cm The results of this work validated the heating potential and fluorescence detection limitations of two theranostic polymer nanoparticles by utilizing alginate tissue phantoms and 3D tumor spheroids. H-DAPPs and PCPDTBSe polymer nanoparticles can be utilized as effective PTT agents by exploiting their absorption of NIR light and H-DAPPs have advantageous fluorescence for imaging colorectal cancer. The data generated from this study design can allow for other NIR absorbing and fluorescing nanoparticle formulations to be evaluated prior to in vivo experimentation. Lasers Surg.

29953620," Artificial teeth have several advantages in preclinical training. The aim of this study is to three-dimensionally (3D) print accurate artificial teeth using scans from X-ray microtomography (XMT). Extracted and artificial teeth were imaged at 90 kV and 40 kV, respectively, to create detailed high contrast scans. The dataset was visualised to produce internal and external meshes subsequently exported to 3D modelling software for modification before finally sending to a slicing program for printing. After appropriate parameter setting, the printer deposited material in specific locations layer by layer, to create a 3D physical model. Scans were manipulated to ensure a clean model was imported into the slicing software, where layer height replicated the high spatial resolution that was observed in the XMT scans. The model was then printed in two different materials (polylactic acid and thermoplastic elastomer). A multimaterial print was created to show the different physical characteristics between enamel and dentine."
29953619," The microbiome and its cross-talk with the brain have drawn increasing attention lately, since imbalances in the gut microbiota's composition may result in pathogenic dysfunctions affecting brain functioning up to development of neurodegenerative and mental diseases. The current Editorial discusses a study by Gao and coworkers in the current issue of the Journal of Neurochemistry in which the authors use a model of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis - targeted infusion of antibiotics into the gut - to assess if microbiotic metabolites exert effects on local neurotransmitter expression or contribute to the gut-brain axis. The authors mechanistically link distal ileal infusion of antibiotics with a change in the levels of microbial metabolites that affect the expression of neurotransmitters in the brain and thereby can participate in the fine-tuning of the hypothalamic functions, including regulation of visceral and neuroendocrine processes, stress responses, mood and anxiety. Their study thus represents an important step towards our understanding of the brain-gut axis, with the potential to advance therapeutics."
29953618," Acrolein, a highly toxic α, β-unsaturated aldehyde, promotes the progression of atherosclerosis in association with inflammatory signaling pathway and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) process. Additionally, hepatic flavin containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) is involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by regulating cholesterol metabolism. Hydroxytyrosol (HT), as a major phenolic compound in olive oil, exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic activities in vitro and animal models. The current study was designed to evaluate whether FMO3 participated in pro-atherogenic process by acrolein and HT showed protective effect during this process. Here, endothelial cells and macrophage Raw264.7 cells were used as the cell models. Following oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OX-LDL) treatment, acrolein exposure promoted foam cells formation in macrophage Raw264.7 cells. The expression of FMO3 and inflammatory makers such as phospho-NF-κB, IL-1β, TNFα as well as IL-6 were significantly increased. However, ATP-binding cassette transporters subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), a major transporter in RCT process, was repressed by acrolein. In addition, FMO3 knockdown could suppress inflammatory markers and promote ABCA1 expression. Hydroxytyrosol (HT) was observed to reduce lipid accumulation, FMO3 expression as well as inflammatory response. Moreover, it promoted ABCA1 expression. Therefore, our findings indicated that acrolein-enhanced atherogenesis by increasing FMO3 which increased inflammatory responses and decreased ABCA1 in vitro can be alleviated by HT, which may have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of atherosclerosis."
29953617," Recently, increasing studies showed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in tumor progression. However, the function and underlying mechanism of HOMEOBOX A11 antisense RNA (HOXA11-AS) on renal cancer remain unclear. In the current study, our data showed that the expression of HOXA11-AS was significantly upregulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tissues and cell lines. High HOXA11-AS expression was associated with the advanced clinical stage, tumor stage, and lymph node metastasis. Function assays showed that HOXA11-AS inhibition significantly suppressed renal cancer cells growth, invasion, and ETM phenotype. In addition, underlying mechanism revealed that HOXA11-AS could act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) that repressed miR-146b-5p expression, which regulated its downstream target MMP16 in renal cancer. Taken together, our findings suggested that HOXA11-AS could promote renal cancer cells growth and invasion by modulating miR-146b-5p-MMP16 axis. Thus, our findings suggested that HOXA11-AS could serve as potential therapeutic target for the treatment of renal cancer."
29953616, The causative effect of GM-CSF produced by cardiac fibroblasts to development of heart failure has not been shown. We identified the pathological GM-CSF-producing cardiac fibroblast subset and the specific deletion of IL-17A signaling to these cells attenuated cardiac inflammation and heart failure. We describe here the CD45
29953615," We present an ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV)-sealed high-stability scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) that can be entirely immersed in liquid helium and readily used in a commercial Dewar or superconducting magnet. The STM head features a horizontal microscanner that can become standalone and ultrastable when the coarse approach inertial motor retracts. Low voltage is enough to operate the STM even at low temperature owing to the powerful motor. It is housed in a tubular chamber of 49 mm outer diameter, which can be pumped via a detachable valve (DV), UHV-sealed and remain sealed after the DV is removed. The entire so-sealed chamber can then be inserted into liquid helium, where in situ sample cleavage is done via vacuum bellow. This allows sample cleavage and STM measurements to take place in better UHV with higher cooling power. Quality atomic resolution images of graphite and charge density wave on 1T-TiSe"
29953606," Pelvic fractures are traumatic injuries that can be caused by motor vehicle accidents, motorcycle accidents, motor vehicle-related pedestrian injuries, or falls from a significant height. These injuries can be life threatening because of the high vascularity of the pelvis and the difficulty in being able to see bleeding occurring in this area. Traditional approaches to treat pelvic fractures have been pelvic binding, external fixation, and open preperitoneal packing; however, the use of angiography and embolization enables faster pinpointing of the location of the bleeding. Increased use of hybrid ORs for treating traumatic pelvic fractures combines the superior imaging of interventional radiology with an OR that can quickly provide open interventions without needing to move a patient from an interventional radiology suite to another OR. This improvement in technology has combined the resources and knowledge of more diverse disciplines to provide a more centralized approach to improving patient outcomes."
29953604," Many surgical procedures are performed in outpatient settings, and outpatient joint replacements are one of the emerging trends in orthopedics. Rising consumer demand for value-driven health care, new technology, and pain management advancements, and more physicians training in minimally invasive surgical techniques during their residency have driven this change. When a facility is considering the establishment of an outpatient joint arthroplasty program, leaders must take into consideration the outcomes data from the facility's current joint arthroplasty program. Additional factors in establishing a successful outpatient program include careful patient selection, preoperative patient education, the presence of a case manager, and specialized protocols and techniques."
29953600," Surgical smoke is formed when energy-generating devices (ie, electrosurgery units, lasers, powered instruments) raise the intracellular temperature of tissue to at least 100º C (212º F), causing tissue vaporization in the form of surgical smoke. Surgical smoke contains components that are known health hazards, such as benzene, toluene, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds, viruses, and bacteria. There have been case reports of human disease tied to the inhalation of surgical smoke; therefore, it is important for perioperative team members to minimize their exposure and patient exposure. In spite of the health risks, many perioperative departments do not consistently and effectively evacuate surgical smoke. This Back to Basics article provides basic steps that perioperative team members can take to protect themselves and their patients from the harm caused by surgical smoke exposure."
29953597," Positioning patients for orthopedic procedures can be a daunting experience for nurses because of the wide variety of orthopedic procedures and available positioners. Understanding what to use for a particular procedure can help perioperative nurses feel more confident and allow them to provide the safest patient care possible. This knowledge also helps avoid workflow delays because of missing or incorrect equipment. Educators or senior staff nurses can provide access to information and education that will help ensure that nurses provide efficient, safe care for patients undergoing orthopedic procedures. Training should begin in the employee orientation phase and be provided when new additions or modifications to positioning policies occur. The educator should validate staff member competency on a regular basis to help ensure the correct equipment is used and to disseminate knowledge regarding any changes or upgrades to positioners."
29953595," Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) face unique challenges when preparing for and undergoing surgery in the perioperative setting. Our goal was to describe this experience via the qualitative evaluation of interviews with parents whose children with ASD had recently undergone surgery in a tertiary medical center. Twelve parents or guardians participated in these interviews. Two independent researchers recorded interviews and analyzed transcripts. The researchers analyzed the interview transcripts using qualitative software to determine the categories of frequent answers to interview questions. Important categories that emerged included behavioral triggers (ie, response to sounds, expression of anxiety and pain), objects used for comfort, communication issues, important people, and advice. We found that children with ASD have specific and unique needs for reassurance and comfort during a perioperative visit. We created a tool, included in this article, to provide a patient-centered framework for interactions with children with ASD in the perioperative environment."

29953591," Recent comprehensive next-generation genome and transcriptome analyses in lung cancer patients, several clinical observations, and compelling evidence from mouse models of lung cancer have uncovered a critical role for Notch signaling in the initiation and progression of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Notably, Rumi is a ""protein O-glucosyltransferase"" that regulates Notch signaling through O-glucosylation of Notch receptors, and is the only enzymatic regulator whose activity is required for both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activation of Notch. We have conducted a detailed study on RUMI's involvement in NSCLC development and progression, and have further explored the therapeutic potential of its targeting in NSCLC. We have determined that Rumi is highly expressed in the alveolar and bronchiolar epithelia, including club cells and alveolar type II cells. Remarkably, RUMI maps to the region of chromosome 3q that corresponds to the major signature of neoplastic transformation in NSCLC, and is markedly amplified and overexpressed in NSCLC tumors. Notably, RUMI expression levels are predictive of poor prognosis and survival in NSCLC patients. Our data indicates that RUMI modulates Notch activity in NSCLC cells, and that its silencing dramatically decreases cell proliferation, migration, and survival. RUMI downregulation causes severe cell cycle S-phase arrest, increases genome instability, and induces late apoptotic-nonapoptotic cell death. Our studies demonstrate that RUMI is a novel negative prognostic factor with significant therapeutic potential in NSCLC, which embodies particular relevance especially when considering that, while current Notch inhibitory strategies target only ligand-dependent Notch activation, a large number of NSCLCs are driven by ligand-independent Notch activity."
29953590," Bone is a multifaceted dynamic tissue, involved in mobility, mineral metabolism, and mesenchymal or stromal and hematopoietic progenitor or stem cells breading. Recently, an endocrine role has been attributed to bone due to its ability to produce at least two hormones (osteocalcin and fibroblast growth factor 23) and to participate directly or indirectly in leptin, insulin, estrogens, and serotonin signaling; regulation; and action. Also, bearing in mind the enormous amounts of substances secreted by the different bone marrow cell types, it becomes understandable the contribution of bone tissue to systemic homeostasis. Besides, bone is a well-known estrogen-responsive tissue, reacting to environmental influences. Thus, it has been coined as a critical target of environmental xenoestrogens, known as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The exposure to EDCs results to disruption or imbalance of the systemic hormonal regulation of the skeleton including bone modeling and remodeling, local hormones, and cytokine or chemokine release. The present report highlights the harmful EDCs effects on bone tissue and provides up-to-date information of xenoestrogen action on proliferation, maturation, and homing of bone marrow inhabitants."
29953589," Doxorubicin (DOX) is a chemotherapy agent widely used in clinical practice, and it is very efficient in tumor suppression, but the use of DOX is limited by a strong association with the development of severe muscle atrophy and cardiotoxicity effects. Reversion or neutralization of the muscular atrophy can lead to a better prognosis. Recent studies have proposed that the negative effect of DOX on skeletal muscle is linked to its inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPk), a key mediator of cellular metabolism. On the basis of this, our goal was to evaluate if aerobic exercise or metformin treatment, activators of AMPk, would be able to attenuate the deleterious effects on skeletal muscle induced by the DOX treatment. C57BL6 mice received either saline (control) or DOX (2.5 mg/kg body weight) intraperitoneally, twice a week. The animals on DOX were further divided into groups that received adjuvant treatment in the form of moderate aerobic physical exercise (DOX+T) or metformin gavage (300 mg/body weight/day). Body weight, metabolism, distance run, muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), and protein synthesis and degradation were assessed. We demonstrated that aerobic training, but not metformin, associated with DOX increased the maximal aerobic capacity without changing muscle mass or fiber CSA, rescuing the muscle fatigue observed with DOX treatment alone. This improvement was associated with AMPk activation, thus surpassing the negative effects of DOX on muscle performance and bioenergetics. In conclusion, aerobic exercise increases AMPk activation and improved the skeletal muscle function, reducing the side effects of DOX."
29953588," Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), as the foremost pathophysiological change of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), contributes to continued deterioration in renal function. Nucleotide-binding domain like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that triggers innate immune responses to infection and cell stress through activation of caspase-1 and maturation of inflammatory pro-interleukin-1β cytokine. Emerging evidence indicates that inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome ameliorates renal injury. Nevertheless, it is uncertain whether NLRP3 inflammasome participates in CIH-induced renal injury. The molecular mechanisms modulating NLRP3 inﬂammasome activation remain to be elucidated. Compared with wild-type mice, NLRP3 knockout mice dramatically protected them from kidney injury, as indicated by the restoration of creatinine levels, lessened histopathological alterations, and the suppression of macrophages inﬁltration stained with F4/80. NLRP3 deﬁciency notably reversed CIH-induced oxidative stress (malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase), concomitantly with the abrogated apoptosis-related proteins and proinflammatory signaling pathway. Consistently, NLRP3-deﬁcient tubular cells remarkably inhibited reactive oxygen species generation and NLRP3 inﬂammasome activation. Furthermore, our study revealed that microRNA-155 (miR-155) was augmented in the renal tissue and HK-2 cells exposed to CIH. In addition, we investigated the role of miR-155 in the regulation of NLRP3 inﬂammasome. Inhibition of miR-155 suppressed the CIH-induced NLRP3 inﬂammasome activation in renal tubular cells, whereas overexpression of miR-155 promoted oxidation and enhanced NLRP3 pathway. Collectively, we demonstrated that miR-155 might be a positive-regulator of NLRP3 pathway by inhibiting the targeted FOXO3a gene. These results established a link between the miR-155/FOXO3a pathway and the NLRP3 inﬂammasome, suggesting pharmacological blockage of NLRP3 as a potential therapeutic strategy for OSA-associated chronic kidney disease."
29953587," Pharmacoresistance is a problem affecting ∼30% of chronic epilepsy patients. An understanding of the mechanisms of pharmacoresistance requires a precise understanding of how antiepileptic drugs interact with their targets in control and epileptic tissue. Although the effects of (S)-licarbazepine (S-Lic) on sodium channel fast inactivation are well understood and have revealed maintained activity in epileptic tissue, it is not known how slow inactivation processes are affected by S-Lic in epilepsy. We have used voltage clamp recordings in isolated dentate granule cells (DGCs) and cortical pyramidal neurons of control versus chronically epileptic rats (pilocarpine model of epilepsy) and in DGCs isolated from hippocampal specimens from temporal lobe epilepsy patients to examine S-Lic effects on sodium channel slow inactivation. S-Lic effects on entry into and recovery from slow inactivation were negligible, even at high concentrations of S-Lic (300 μmol/L). Much more pronounced S-Lic effects were observed on the voltage dependence of slow inactivation, with significant effects at 100 μmol/L S-Lic in DGCs from control and epileptic rats or temporal lobe epilepsy patients. For none of these effects of S-Lic could we observe significant differences either between sham-control and epileptic rats, or between human DGCs and the two animal groups. S-Lic was similarly effective in cortical pyramidal neurons from sham-control and epileptic rats. Finally, we show in expression systems that S-Lic effects on slow inactivation voltage dependence are only observed in Na From these data, we conclude that a major mechanism of action of S-Lic is an effect on slow inactivation, primarily through effects on slow inactivation voltage dependence of Na"
29953586," Detection of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is of paramount importance in epilepsy presurgical evaluation. Our study aims at utilizing quantitative positron emission tomography (QPET) analysis to complement magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) postprocessing by a morphometric analysis program (MAP) to facilitate automated identification of subtle FCD. We retrospectively included a consecutive cohort of surgical patients who had a negative preoperative MRI by radiology report. MAP was performed on T1-weighted volumetric sequence and QPET was performed on PET/computed tomographic data, both with comparison to scanner-specific normal databases. Concordance between MAP and QPET was assessed at a lobar level, and the significance of concordant QPET-MAP A total of 104 patients were included. When QPET thresholds of SD = -1, -2, and -3 were used, complete resection of the QPET-MAP Our study demonstrates a practical and effective approach to combine quantitative analyses of functional (QPET) and structural (MAP) imaging data to improve identification of subtle epileptic abnormalities. This approach can be readily adopted by epilepsy centers to improve postresective seizure outcomes for patients without apparent lesions on MRI."
29953585," Amphibians are among the most threatened vertebrates in the world and this is also true for those inhabiting the Atlantic Forest hotspot, living in ecosystems that are highly degraded and threatened by anthropogenic activities. We present a data set containing information about amphibian communities sampled throughout the Atlantic Forest Biome in South America. The data were extracted from 389 bibliographic references (articles, books, theses, and dissertations) representing inventories of amphibian communities from 1940 to 2017. The data set includes 17,619 records of 528 species with taxonomic certainty, from 1,163 study sites. Of all the records, 14,450 (82%) were classified using the criterion of endemism; of those, 7,787 (44%) were considered endemic and 6,663 (38%) were not. Historically, multiple sampling methods were used to survey amphibians, the most representative methods being active surveys (82.1%), surveys at breeding sites (20%), pitfall traps (15.3%), and occasional encounters (14.5%). Species richness averaged 15.2 ± 11.3 (mean ± SD), ranging from 1 to 80 species per site. We found a low dominance in the communities, with 10 species occurring in about 26% of communities: Physalaemus cuvieri (4.1%), Dendropsophus minutus (3.8%), Boana faber (3.1%), Scinax fuscovarius (2.8%), Leptodactylus latrans (2.7%), Leptodactylus fuscus (2.6%), Boana albopunctata (2.3%), Dendropsophus nanus (1.6%), Rhinella ornata (1.6%), and Leptodactylus mystacinus (1.6%). This data set represents a major effort to compile inventories of amphibian communities for the Neotropical region, filling a large gap in the data on the Atlantic Forest hotspot. We hope this data set can be used as a credible tool in the proposal of new studies on amphibian sampling and even in the development of conservation planning for these taxa. This information also has great relevance for macroecological studies, being foundational for both conservation and restoration strategies in this biodiversity hotspot. No copyright or proprietary restrictions are associated with the use of this data set. Please cite this data paper when the data are used in publications or teaching events."
29953584," This article reviews the profile of perampanel, a novel noncompetitive α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) receptor antagonist, and its role as a potential broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug in the treatment of epilepsy. For this narrative review, data were collected using specified search criteria. Articles reporting the evidence for perampanel's efficacy from preclinical models, phase 3 clinical studies, observational studies, and descriptive evidence were included. AMPA receptors play a key role in mediating the action of glutamate at the excitatory synapse. Preclinical research showed the AMPA receptor blockade to constitute a promising target for antiepileptic drug therapy. In animal models, perampanel proved to be protective against seizures and reduce seizure severity and duration. Four phase-3 randomized controlled trials (3 in patients with focal seizures and one in primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in idiopathic generalized epilepsy) have been completed. In focal (partial) onset seizures, perampanel (4, 8, and 12 mg) significantly reduced seizure frequency per 28 days (23.3%-28.8% vs 12.8%; P < .01) and responder rates (≥50% reduction in seizures) (28.5%-35.3% vs 19.3%; P < .05) compared with placebo. In primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, perampanel 8 mg resulted in greater reduction in seizure frequency per 28 days (-76.5% vs -38.4%; P < .0001) and responder rate (64.2% vs 39.5%; P = .0019) than placebo. The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of perampanel have been reproduced in real-world clinical practice, and the agent has been shown to be effective in other epilepsy syndromes. Perampanel is a potentially broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug with a novel mechanism of action that may be a useful addition for patients with epilepsy with various seizure types. The availability of novel antiepileptic drugs for epilepsy treatment enables more individualized treatment for these patients."
29953583," Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA expression in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is associated with an unmutated immunoglobulin profile and poor clinical outcome. We evaluated the subcellular localization of LPL protein in CLL cells that did or did not express LPL mRNA. Our results show that LPL protein is differently located in CLL cells depending on whether it is incorporated from the extracellular medium in mutated CLL or generated de novo by leukaemic cells of unmutated patients. The specific quantification of endogenous LPL protein correlates with mRNA expression levels and mutational IGHV status, suggesting LPL protein as a possible reliable prognostic marker in CLL."
29953582," Application of deep-learning technology to skin cancer classification can potentially improve skin cancer screening sensitivity and specificity, but the number of training images required for such system is thought to be extremely large. To determine if deep-learning technology could be used to develop an efficient skin cancer classifying system with a relatively small dataset of clinical images. A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) was trained using a dataset of 4867 clinical images obtained from 1842 patients diagnosed with skin tumors at the University of Tsukuba Hospital from 2003 to 2016. The images consisted of 14 diagnoses, including both malignant and benign conditions. Its performance was tested against 13 board-certified dermatologists and 9 dermatology trainees. Overall classification accuracy of the trained DCNN was 76.5%. The DCNN achieved 96.3% sensitivity (correctly classified malignant as malignant) and 89.5% specificity (correctly classified benign as benign). Although the accuracy of malignant or benign classification by the board-certified dermatologists was statistically higher than that of the dermatology trainees (85.3% ± 3.7% and 74.4% ± 6.8%, P < .01), the DCNN achieved greater accuracy, as high as 92.4% ± 2.1% (P < .0001). We developed an efficient skin tumor classifier using a DCNN trained on a relatively small dataset. The DCNN could classify images of skin tumors more accurately than board-certified dermatologists. Collectively, the current system may have capabilities for screening purposes in general medical practice, particularly because it only requires a single clinical image for classification.

29953581," Mendelian randomization studies and ""human knock-out"" studies of rare loss-of-function coding variants suggest that plasma levels of LDL-C, triglycerides and Lp(a) are causally associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease, and therefore therapies directed against these targets should reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. However, several therapies directed against these targets have failed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in large-scale randomized trials, thus suggesting that causality is not sufficient evidence to establish genetic target validation. Instead, the critical question that needs to be answered to improve drug discovery and development is how much a causal biomarker needs to be changed to produce a clinically meaningful benefit in a short-term trial. This review describes how to use naturally randomized genetic evidence to accurately anticipate the results of randomized trials evaluating current and future lipid lowering therapies, inform the design of randomized trials, and transform the drug discovery and development process.

29953580," Macropinocytosis has been implicated in cardiovascular disorders, cancer, allergic diseases, viral and bacterial infections, and other pathologies. Unfortunately, the currently available pharmacological inhibitors of macropinocytosis interrupt other endocytic processes and have non-specific endocytosis-independent effects. The goal of the present study was to identify new, clinically relevant inhibitors of macropinocytosis using an FDA-approved drug library. In the present study, 640 FDA-approved compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit macropinocytosis. A series of secondary assays were performed to confirm inhibitory activity, determine IC The primary screen identified 14 compounds that at ~10 μM concentration inhibit >95% of macropinocytotic solute internalization. Our results demonstrated that three lead compounds, namely imipramine, phenoxybenzamine, and vinblastine, potently inhibit (IC The current findings identify imipramine as a new pharmacological tool to study macropinocytosis in cellular and biological systems. This study also suggests that imipramine might be a compelling candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent in pathological processes involving macropinocytosis."
29953579," This article reviews the burden of epilepsy in Asia, the challenges faced by people with epilepsy, and the management of epilepsy. Comparison is made with other parts of the world. For this narrative review, data were collected using specified search criteria. Articles investigating the epidemiology of epilepsy, diagnosis, comorbidities and associated mortality, stigmatization, and treatment were included. Epilepsy is a global health care issue affecting up to 70 million people worldwide. Nearly 80% of people with epilepsy live in low- and middle-income countries with limited resources. People with epilepsy are prone to physical and psychological comorbidities, including anxiety and depression, which can negatively impact their quality of life. Furthermore, people with epilepsy are at higher risk of premature death than people without epilepsy. Discrimination or stigmatization of people with epilepsy is common in Asia and can affect their education, work, and marriage opportunities. Access to epilepsy treatment varies throughout Asia. Although highly advanced treatment is available in some countries, up to 90% of people with epilepsy are not adequately treated or are not treated with conventional antiepileptic therapy in resource-limited countries. People in remote areas often do not receive any epilepsy care. First-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are available, but usually only in urban areas, and second-generation AEDs are not available in all countries. Newer AEDs tend to have more favorable safety profiles than first-generation AEDs and provide options to tailor therapy for individual patients, especially those with comorbidities. Active epilepsy surgery centers are present in some countries, although epilepsy surgery is often underutilized given the number of patients who could benefit. Further epidemiologic research is needed to provide accurate epilepsy data across the Asian region. Coordinated action is warranted to improve access to treatment and care."
29953578," Information gap in drug labelingamong countries create challenges in therapeutic use of drugs.We aimed to evaluate the consistency ofdrug interaction information in drug labels among five countries. The studydrugs were chosen fromthe commonly approved drug list inthe United States, United Kingdom, China, Japan, and Korea. The degree of agreement of drug interaction data wasevaluated by kappa coefficient.Thirty-eight drugs wereevaluated, and moderate degree of agreement was observed among all countries' labeling (κ = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.41-0.46).

29953577," AHA is an extremely rare disorder, with annual incidence of 1.5 cases per million population. This clinical entity is caused by autoantibodies directed against coagulation factor VIII, what leads to decreased serum activity of thereof, and is characterized by spontaneous or induced by trauma, or invasive procedure bleeding. Approximately 50% of cases are idiopathic in origin, affecting both sexes, with median age at diagnosis of 74 years. We present a case report of a patient diagnosed with acquired haemophilia A (AHA) in the perioperative period."

29953575," Significant fluid retention is common after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of hypertonic saline-hydroxyethyl starch (HS-HES) solution on fluid accumulation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG). Fifty adult male patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery were enrolled in this interventional, randomized, double-blinded study to compare HS-HES with saline solution. The study fluid (250 mL) was given into the venous reservoir of the CPB circuit at the time of aortic declamping. Body mass change from the baseline to the first postoperative morning was significantly less in the HS-HES group compared with the control group (3.3 ± 1.5 kg vs. 4.4 ± 1.5 kg, P = 0.022). In the extracellular water (ECW) or ECW-balance, there were no significant differences between the groups. The need for fluids and diuretic medication did not differ between the groups during the perioperative period. Our study shows that 250 mL of HS-HES solution can reduce perioperative fluid accumulation to some degree in patients undergoing CABG surgery with CPB."
29953574," Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) detects the inflammatory response to surgical trauma in hip surgery. It corresponds to the type of surgery, with a higher level of CRP being found in surgery techniques with greater tissue damage. The aim of our study was to analyze the CRP level in serum and drainage blood after hip surgery in patients with coxarthrosis depending on the method of anaesthesia and post-operative analgesia. 65 patients, 58 ± 12 years old, were included in the study. All patients underwent hip replacement surgery due to coxarthrosis. Serum CRP was measured before surgery and on the 1st, 3rd and 7th postoperative days. The CRP level in drainage blood was detected on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd postoperative days. Patients were divided into six groups according to the techniques of intraoperative anaesthesia and postoperative analgesia. Before surgery, plasma CRP did not differ significantly among the groups. The smallest increase in plasma CRP was found in patients operated on under regional anaesthesia compared with those operated on under general anaesthesia. Postoperatively, the plasma CRP level was higher in patients treated with the systemic administration of opioids+NSAID, than in patients treated with regional analgesia. A significant increase in CRP levels in drainage blood for three days postoperatively was seen in all groups. In patients operated on under general anaesthesia and receiving systemic opioids+NSAID postoperatively, CRP in drainage blood was higher in comparison with those operated on under regional anaesthesia and treated with regional methods of postoperative analgesia. C-reactive protein levels in plasma and drainage blood depends on the method of anaesthesia and postoperative analgesia after hip surgery. Regional anaesthesia/analgesia methods limit one's inflammatory response to surgical trauma detected by CRP."
29953573," Ultrasonography-assessed hyomental distance (HMD) ratio has been found to discriminate between obese patients with Cormack-Lehane grades 1 or 2 vs. those with grades 3 or 4. The aim of our study is to evaluate the performance of the HMD evaluated ultrasonographically in neutral, ramped, and maximum hyperextended positions, as well as for the ratios obtained by dividing the HMD in the ramped position to that in the neutral position (HMDR1) and by dividing the HMD in maximum hyperextension to that in the neutral position (HMDR2), in order to predict the occurrence of Cormack-Lehane grades 3 or 4 during direct laryngoscopy. Ultrasound measurements were performed preoperatively in 25 patients with morbid obesity, measuring the HMD in the neutral, ramped, and maximum hyperextended positions. Pre-epyglotic soft tissue thickness, Mallampati and upper lip bite test scores were recorded. Cormack-Lehane grading was considered as an outcome variable in the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve analysis. HMD in the neutral, ramped and maximum hyperextended positions presented similar sensitivities, 100% [39.8-100.0]. For HMD, specificity was 42.86% [21.8-66.0] in the neutral position, 61.9% [38.4-81.9] in the ramped postion, and 71.4% [47.8-88.7] in the maximum hyperextended position. For HMDR1, the cut-off value was 1.12. This threshold provides 75% [19.4-99.4] sensitivity and 76.2% [52.8-91.8] specificity. For HMDR2, a cut-off value of 1.23 provides 100% [39.8-100.0] sensitivity and 90.5% [69.6-98.8] specificity. HMDR2 seems to have superior diagnostic accuracy in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in the obese population compared to HMDR1, as well as compared to the HMD in the neutral, ramped, and maximum hyperextended positions."
29953572," In nearly all cases of general anaesthesia with a volatile agent, the anaesthetic concentration has to be increased. Since the anaesthetic affects both the factors determining intracranial homeostasis and the systemic circulation, it is crucial that cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is protected. The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of gradually increased concentrations of desflurane on the cerebral and systemic circulations based on CPP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), intracranial pressure (ICP) and their correlations. The study was carried out on 25 rabbits of the same gender (male) randomly assigned to two groups: control (n = 10) and group I (n = 15). Over three 15-minute periods, the animals were exposed to increase concentrations of desflurane so as to achieve 1/3, 2/3 and 1 MAC Minimal Alveolar Concentration (3, 6, 9 vol%) of the effective end-tidal concentration of desflurane (Et) at the end of each period, respectively. Intragroup analysis of CPP changes demonstrated decreases in its successive values from minute 18, compared with baseline values. The mean values of ICP did not differ throughout the experiment. From minute 19 on, all successive values of MAP decreased compared with baseline values. A weak correlation (r = -0.2179) was found between ICP and CPP and a strong correlation between MAP and CPP (r = 0.98829). Moreover, there was a strong correlation between Etdesflurane vs. CPP (r = -0.8769) and MAP (r = -0.8224) and a weak correlation versus ICP (r = 0.15755). A decrease in CPP induced by desflurane was associated with a decrease in MAP but not an increase in ICP. The depressive effect of desflurane on the cerebral and systemic circulations is a consequence of its effector site concentration."
29953571," As organ transplantation science continues to mature, both physicians and the public face challenges defining death and, subsequently, caring for an individual when they are deemed eligible for organ procurement. This paper revisits the anaesthesiologist's role with respect to the provision of analgesic medication at the time of organ procurement. It provides a historical overview of the ethics of organ procurement, explaining how the definition of brain death and the ethical principle of the 'dead donor rule' have shaped the practice of organ procurement. It concludes by suggesting that a re-framing of the ethics of organ procurement may be necessary in order for anaesthesiologists to meet their ethical obligation of preventing harm to organ donors while maintaining public trust in the medical profession."
29953570," To evaluate the long-term effects of preventive measures against denture fracture using clinical surveys of denture fracture cases from 1984 and 2009. This study included 128 patients who presented with a chief complaint of denture fracture and received denture repair treatment in 2009. The following data were collected: denture repair procedure; location of denture base fracture (with or without reinforcement); and period of denture use from insertion to repair. Significant differences in characteristics between patients treated in 1984 and 2009 were determined using the chi-square test (P < .05). In 2009, denture fractures comprised 55.5% of all repair cases. The most frequent location of denture fracture was around the clasp and metal in the denture base. Approximately 45% of all dentures were reinforced. The mean period from denture insertion to repair was 37 months. The number of denture fractures significantly decreased between 1984 and 2009 (P < .05), and the number of dentures with reinforcement significantly increased (P < .05). The mean period from denture insertion to repair also increased. These findings suggest that denture reinforcement as a preventive measure is effective against denture fracture, allowing patients to use their dentures more effectively."
29953569," To clarify the relationship between residual ridge morphology and pressure distribution of the alveolar bone surface during dental impression procedures. Seven experimental models of the mandibular posterior residual ridge with the same ridge morphology but different mucosa (ie, silicone material) thicknesses and bone (ie, plaster) shapes and sizes were fabricated. The pressure on the bone surface was recorded using a pressure sensor sheet. The data from each model were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and P < .05 was considered statistically significant. Even with the same ridge morphology, the distribution of the impression pressure on the bone surface differed according to the mucosal thickness and bone shape and size. Pressure tended to concentrate on sharp edges and prominences of a slope and became more widely distributed as the mucosal thickness increased. Within the limitations of this experimental study, the morphology of the residual alveolar ridge (bone and mucosa) appears to be a significant influencing factor for the pressure distribution during impression procedures."
29953568, To evaluate the influence of cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) casting alloys' melting temperatures on the cast-to Co-Cr implant cylinders' marginal fit. Co-Cr alloys with different melting ranges were cast into 20 Co-Cr cylinders: 10 in a high-melting temperature (HMT) group and 10 in a low-melting temperature (LMT) group. Ten cylinders were used as received as a control group. Cylinders' marginal misfit and dimensional stability were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (×500). HMT cylinders showed significant differences in marginal misfit (2.48 ± 1.07 μm
29953567," To assess the efficacy of two experimental denture adhesive gels (adhesives 1 and 2) compared to a commercially available denture adhesive cream (positive control) and no adhesive (negative control). This was a single-center, randomized, four-treatment, examiner-blind, crossover study in participants with well-made and at least moderately well-fitting maxillary complete dentures. Incisal bite force until denture dislodgment was measured before application (baseline) and over the following 12 hours for each of the treatments. Between-treatment differences in the area over baseline (AOB) for the bite force at each time point were analyzed using an analysis of covariance model. The efficacy and safety analyses were based on results from 48 participants. Compared to the negative control, adhesive 1 showed a statistically significantly higher bite force AOB over 12 hours (AOB Only adhesive 1 was significantly better than the negative control, and its performance did not match that of the positive control. Adhesives 1 and 2 showed the largest number of oral adverse events."
29953566," To assess the marginal fit of provisional polylactic acid (PLA) crowns obtained via three-dimensional (3D) printing using a profile projector. A stone cast was scanned, and 15 provisional dental crowns were designed and printed in PLA using a 0.2-mm nozzle and 135-degree build angle. The marginal fit was measured at six points on each crown using a profile projector. Within the limitations of this study, the marginal fit of PLA provisional restorations was clinically acceptable, and the results were comparable to those observed with polymethyl methacrylate provisional restorations."
29953565," To analyze the marginal adaptation of computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufactured (CAD/CAM) porcelain laminate veneers. A total of 25 three-dimensional (3D) machine-milled laminate veneers were divided into five groups of five each according to fabrication material (E-max; Empress; Lava Ultimate; Suprinity; and Vita Mark II) and cemented in 25 prepared acrylic central incisors. Digital microscopy images (×7.5 magnification) were analyzed for gaps in the mesial/distal surfaces of the prepared tooth and in the cervical, medial, and incisal thirds. All CAD/CAM laminate veneers except for Empress and Suprinity in the middle and incisal thirds showed good results (ie, gaps < 120 μm in the cervical, middle, and incisal thirds)."
29953564," To propose a revised Lekholm and Zarb classification that takes into account all possible combinations of compact and trabecular bone and to provide guidelines for increased reproducibility of the classification. Three new classes were added to the previous classification. The new classes have been designated as subclasses of bone types 2 and 3, as follows: Type 2b: Thick layer of compact bone surrounding a core of medium-density trabecular bone; Type 2c: Thick layer of compact bone surrounding a core of low-density trabecular bone; and Type 3b: Thin layer of compact bone surrounding a core of medium-density trabecular bone. Three interpretation guidelines were recommended to increase the reproducibility of the revised classification. Three experienced examiners were trained using the revised classification and provided with computed tomography (CT) sectional images of edentulous jawbones for classification. Each examiner classified the images twice with at least a 1-week interval. The intra-observer agreement was measured. The kappa statistic for the intra-observer agreement of the examiners ranged from 0.835 to 0.919 (P < .001). The high reproducibility of the proposed revised CT-based Lekholm and Zarb classification obtained in the current study suggests its efficacy in distinguishing between the various combinations of compact and trabecular bone."
29953563, Utilizing intraoral bite blocks can aid in stabilizing the mandible during radiation treatment (RT) and minimizing side effects to healthy tissues. This report describes a technique to fabricate a customized acrylic repositioning immobilization bite block that was integrated into the clinical workflow of radiation appointments with no delay in starting RT and with increased patient comfort.
29953562," To investigate the mechanical properties and wear of nylon inserts and abutments in Locator-retained, implant-supported overdentures (L-IODs). Clinical wear of inserts and abutments was qualitatively rated in a group of 16 patients with L-IODs. The inserts were also subjected to microscopic analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Wear was identified in almost all inserts and abutments. These results were corroborated by DSC and TGA analyses, which showed significant mechanical deterioration of the inserts. Nylon inserts and Locator abutments show relevant signs of deterioration in clinical use, indicating that regular maintenance is an issue that should be addressed with the patients prior to treatment."
29953561," To evaluate plaque accumulation, peri-implant soft tissue inflammation, and bone resorption in patients with immediately loaded implants supporting fixed full-arch prostheses. A convenience sample of 72 patients treated with fixed full-arch prostheses supported by four to six immediately loaded implants was selected. Bleeding on probing (BOP), Plaque Index (PI), and peri-implant bone loss were measured. The Sixth European Workshop on Periodontology definitions of mucositis and peri-implantitis were used, and collected data were analyzed using a nonparametric test (Spearman's rank correlation). Correlation coefficients (ρ) were defined as follows: < 0.2 = very weak; 0.2 to 0.39 = weak; 0.4 to 0.59 = moderate; 0.6 to 0.79 = strong; 0.8 to 1.0 = very strong. A total of 331 implants were analyzed. The mean follow-up observation time was 5.8 years (range: 1 to 14 years); mean PI and BOP were 61.7% and 21.1%, respectively; and mean bone loss was 0.89 mm (standard deviation [SD] 1.09). The mean probing depth was 1.8 mm (range: 0.5 to 5 mm). Five patients presented with one implant each affected by peri-implantitis (6.9%), and 15 patients presented with at least one implant affected by mucositis (20.8%). No correlation was found between PI and bone resorption (P = .08). Very weak correlations were found between BOP and bone resorption (ρ = 0.18; P = .001) and between PI and BOP (ρ = 0.13, P = .019). The results suggest that plaque accumulation is correlated with peri-implant mucositis; however, plaque accumulation alone does not appear to be associated with bone resorption."

29953559," We examined late Holocene (ca. 3300 yr BP to present-day) climate variability in the central Northwest Territories (Canadian Subarctic) using a diatom and sedimentological record from Danny's Lake (63.48ºN, 112.54ºW), located 40 km southwest of the modern-day treeline. High-resolution sampling paired with a robust age model (25 radiocarbon dates) allowed for the examination of both lake hydroecological conditions (30-year intervals; diatoms) and sedimentological changes in the watershed (12-year intervals; grain size records) over the late Holocene. Time series analysis of key lake ecological indicators (diatom species Aulacoseira alpigena, Pseudostaurosira brevistriata and Achnanthidium minutissimum) and sedimentological parameters, reflective of catchment processes (coarse silt fraction), suggests significant intermittent variations in turbidity, pH and light penetration within the lake basin. In the diatom record, we observed discontinuous periodicities in the range of ca. 69, 88-100, 115-132, 141-188, 562, 750 and 900 years (>90% and >95% confidence intervals), whereas the coarse silt fraction was characterized by periodicities in the >901 and <61-year range (>95% confidence interval). Periodicities in the proxy data from the Danny's Lake sediment core align with changes in total solar irradiance over the past ca. 3300 yr BP and we hypothesize a link to the Suess Cycle, Gleissberg Cycle and Pacific Decadal Oscillation via occasional inland propagation of shifting air masses over the Pacific Ocean. This research represents an important baseline study of the underlying causes of climate variability in the Canadian Subarctic and provides details on the long-term climate variability that has persisted in this region through the past three thousand years."
29953557," A quantitative basis for the use of dipstick urinalysis for risk assessment of all-cause mortality is scarce. Therefore, we investigated the association between dipstick proteinuria and all-cause mortality in a general population and evaluated the effect of confounders on this association. The study population included 17,342,956 adults who underwent health examinations between 2005 and 2008 under the National Health Insurance System. Proteinuria was determined using a single dipstick urinalysis, and the primary outcome of this study was all-cause mortality. The prognostic impact of proteinuria was assessed by constructing a multivariable Cox model. The mean age of the study population (53.24% male) was 46.06 years; 724,681 deaths from all causes occurred over a median follow-up period of 9.34 years (interquartile range 8.17-10.16), and the maximum follow-up was 12.12 years. After full adjustment for covariates, a higher level of dipstick proteinuria indicated a higher risk of all-cause death [Hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals); 1.22 (1.20-1.24), 1.47 (1.45-1.49), 1.81 (1.77-1.84), 2.32 (2.24-2.41), 2.74 (2.54-2.96); trace to 4+, respectively], and various subgroup analyses did not affect the main outcome for the total population. ≥1+ proteinuria in the group without metabolic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, or obesity) resulted in higher hazard ratios than those in the group with metabolic diseases and negative or trace proteinuria. Our study showed a strong association between dipstick proteinuria and all-cause mortality in this nationwide population-based cohort in South Korea."
29953556," The propagation of concepts in a population of agents is a form of influence spread, which can be modelled as a cascade from a set of initially activated individuals. The study of such influence cascades, in particular the identification of influential individuals, has a wide range of applications including epidemic control, viral marketing and the study of social norms. In real-world environments there may be many concepts spreading and interacting. These interactions can affect the spread of a given concept, either boosting it and allowing it to spread further, or inhibiting it and limiting its capability to spread. Previous work does not consider how the interactions between concepts affect concept spread. Taking concept interactions into consideration allows for indirect concept manipulation, meaning that we can affect concepts we are not able to directly control. In this paper, we consider the problem of indirect concept manipulation, and propose heuristics for indirectly boosting or inhibiting concept spread in environments where concepts interact. We define a framework that allows for the interactions between any number of concepts to be represented, and present a heuristic that aims to identify important influence paths for a given target concept in order to manipulate its spread. We compare the performance of this heuristic, called maximum probable gain, against established heuristics for manipulating influence spread."
29953555," Despite remarkable progress in the reduction of under-five mortality, childhood diarrhea is still the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in this highly susceptible and vulnerable population. In Ethiopia, study findings regarding prevalence and determinants of diarrhea amongst under-five children have been inconsistent. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis estimates the pooled prevalence of diarrhea and its determinants among under-five children in Ethiopia. International databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and the Cochrane Library, were systematically searched. All identified observational studies reporting the prevalence and determinants of diarrhea among under-five children in Ethiopia were included. Two authors independently extracted all necessary data using a standardized data extraction format. STATA Version 13 statistical software was used. The Cochrane Q test statistics and I2 test were used to assess the heterogeneity of the studies. A random effects model was computed to estimate the pooled prevalence of diarrhea. Moreover, the associations between determinant factors and childhood diarrhea were examined using the random effect model. After reviewing of 535 studies, 31studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The findings from the 31 studies revealed that the pooled prevalence of diarrhea among under-five children in Ethiopia was 22% (95%CI: 19, 25%). Subgroup analysis of this study revealed that the highest prevalence was observed in Afar region (27%), followed by Somali and Dire Dawa regions (26%), then Addis Abeba (24%). Lack of maternal education (OR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.3, 2.1), lack of availability of latrine (OR: 2.0, 95%CI: 1.3, 3.2), urban residence (OR: 1.9, 95%CI: 1.2, 3.0), and maternal hand washing (OR: 2.2, 95%CI: 2.0, 2.6) were significantly associated with childhood diarrhea. In this study, diarrhea among under-five children in Ethiopia was significantly high. Lack of maternal education, lack of availability of latrine, urban residence, and lack of maternal hand washing were significantly associated with childhood diarrhea."
29953554," Pheromones are known to play an important role in butterfly courtship and may influence both individual reproductive success and reproductive isolation between species. Recent studies have focused on courtship in Hipparchia butterflies (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae) emphasizing morphological and behavioural traits, as well as genetic differences. Behavioural observations suggested a role for chemical cues in mate and species recognition, where the androconial scales on the forewings of these species may be involved in chemical communication between individuals. Cchemical-mediated signals have received relatively little attention in this genus. Here, we report the results of a three-year investigation of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by Hipparchia fagi and H. hermione in order to identify differences in VOCs between these species where they live in syntopy. Our study was carried out using an array of cross-selective sensors known as an ""Electronic Nose"" (EN) that operates by converting chemical patterns into patterns of sensor signals. While the identity of volatile compounds remained unknown, sensor signals can be compared to identify similar or dissimilar chemical patterns. Based on the EN signals, our results showed that: 1) the two sexes have a similar VOCs pattern in H. fagi, while they significantly diverge in H. hermione; 2) VOCs patterns were different between females of the two species, while those of males were not."
29953553," Tools to aid in the prognosis assessment of colon cancer patients in terms of risk of mortality are needed. Goals of this study are to develop and validate clinical prediction rules for 1- and 2-year mortality in these patients. This is a prospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with colon cancer who underwent surgery at 22 hospitals. The main outcomes were mortality at 1 and 2 years after surgery. Background, clinical parameters, and diagnostic tests findings were evaluated as possible predictors. Multivariable multilevel logistic regression and survival models were used in the analyses to create the clinical prediction rules. Models developed in the derivation sample were validated in another sample of the study. American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System (ASA), Charlson comorbidity index (> = 4), age (>75 years), residual tumor (R2), TNM stage IV and log of lymph nodes ratio (> = -0.53) were predictors of 1-year mortality (C-index (95% CI): 0.865 (0.792-0.938)). Adjuvant chemotherapy was an additional predictor. Again ASA, Charlson Index (> = 4), age (>75 years), log of lymph nodes ratio (> = -0.53), TNM, and residual tumor were predictors of 2-year mortality (C-index:0.821 (0.766-0.876). Chemotherapy was also an additional predictor. These clinical prediction rules show very good predictive abilities of one and two years survival and provide clinicians and patients with an easy and quick-to-use decision tool for use in the clinical decision process while the patient is still in the index admission."
29953552," Nontyphoidal Salmonella infections contribute to approximately 1.2 million annual illnesses in the United States. Historical and recent outbreaks have been associated with dairy products, ground beef, and direct contact with cattle. Salmonella antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious concern that can reduce successful treatment of infections, increasing recovery time, medical costs, and mortality rates in humans and animals. This highlights the need to track AMR in Salmonella isolated from cattle to improve treatment plans, manage trends in AMR, and prevent future AMR development. A total of 242 Salmonella isolates were retrieved from 9,162 cattle fecal samples submitted to the University of California, Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital from 2002 to 2016. These isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using a standardized broth dilution panel. Multidrug resistance (MDR) to three or more classes of antimicrobials was observed in 50.8% of isolates, and the most common MDR pattern was amoxicillin-ampicillin-cefoxitin-ceftiofur-ceftriaxone-chloramphenicol-streptomycin-tetracycline (23.2%). There were significantly greater odds for antimicrobial resistance to aminoglycosides (OR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.1-3.7), penicillins (OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.007-3.5), and tetracyclines (OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.017-3.4) for the 2002-2009 period when compared to the 2010-2016 period. The most prevalent MDR serotypes were Newport (100% MDR, n = 52), Typhimurium (100%, n = 20), and Dublin (71% MDR, n = 46). Risk factors associated with higher odds for isolating MDR Salmonella included isolates from calves when compared to adult cattle (OR: 22.0; 95% C.I.: 3.9-125.7), and isolates obtained from cattle suspect of having salmonellosis versus from the infectious disease control surveillance program (OR:13.7; 95%C.I.: 2.8-66.8). Despite a temporal trend for reduced AMR to most antimicrobial drug classes, a lack of this observed in the 2002-2009 period when compared to the 2010-2016 period for important drug classes such as cephalosporins (OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 0.87-3.1), and a trend for temporal increase in resistant to quinolones drugs (P value 0.004) highlight the relevance of AMR surveillance in cattle with Salmonella infections with the aim of targeting future prophylactic interventions."
29953551," Cytochromes P450 are enzymes that participate in a wide range of functions in plants, from hormonal signaling and biosynthesis of structural polymers, to defense or communication with other organisms. They represent one of the largest gene/protein families in the plant kingdom. The manual annotation of cytochrome P450 genes in the genome of Vitis vinifera PN40024 revealed 579 P450 sequences, including 279 complete genes. Most of the P450 sequences in grapevine genome are organized in physical clusters, resulting from tandem or segmental duplications. Although most of these clusters are small (2 to 35, median = 3), some P450 families, such as CYP76 and CYP82, underwent multiple duplications and form large clusters of homologous sequences. Analysis of gene expression revealed highly specific expression patterns, which are often the same within the genes in large physical clusters. Some of these genes are induced upon biotic stress, which points to their role in plant defense, whereas others are specifically activated during grape berry ripening and might be responsible for the production of berry-specific metabolites, such as aroma compounds. Our work provides an exhaustive and robust annotation including clear identification, structural organization, evolutionary dynamics and expression patterns for the grapevine cytochrome P450 families, paving the way to efficient functional characterization of genes involved in grapevine defense pathways and aroma biosynthesis."
29953550," The calorific value (CAL, KJ g-1) of different plant organs are important plant traits. Variation in CAL among different plant organs reflects the energy utilization and distribution strategy of plant. Here, we explored how the CAL of different plant organs varies at the species and regional level in relation to vegetation type (3697 forests samples, 430 grasslands samples, and 146 deserts samples). The results showed that, in the forests and grasslands, CAL significantly differed among the different organs and functional types of plants. The CAL of different organs in forests was ordered as: leaf (19.71 ± 1.82 KJ g-1) > branch (19.33 ± 1.32 KJ g-1) > trunk (19.09 ± 1.44 KJ g-1) > root (19.02 ± 1.11 KJ g-1). For forests, the CAL of plant organs, except for the leaves of trees and shrubs, increased with increasing latitude (P < 0.01). In comparison, the CAL in the roots of shrubs and herbs decreased with increasing longitude (P < 0.01). Through delineating systematic references of CAL among different plant organs, our findings provide key parameters to improve estimates of biomass energy at regional and global scales."
29953549," We undertook a comparative survey of gastric emptying (GE) kinetics after two variants of bypass surgery for upper bowel obstruction. In 10 dogs with experimental upper bowel obstruction, five were randomized to obtain gastrojejunal anastomosis (GA), and the other five received Roux-en-Y duodenojejunal anastomosis (DA). Duplicate scintigraphic measurements of GE of a solid meal were accomplished in every animal before surgery and during the early (2-3 weeks), medium (3 months), and late (6 months) post-operative period. The GE curves were fitted with a power-exponential function to derive the GE half time T½, and the curve shape parameter S. Early after surgery T½ slightly decreased by -18±21 min in the DA group and lengthened by 91±37 min in the GA group (p = 0.042). In both groups an increase in the S parameter was found then. In either group T½ gradually declined towards the basal value during the medium and late post-operative period. On the other hand, net differences relative to the basal situation in the S values appeared to be positive in the GA group (0.32±0.11 at 3 months; 0.64±0.19 at six months), and negative in the DA group (-0.30±0.09 at 3 months; -0.01±0.20 at six months). Hence a statistically significant contrast was found between those differences: p = 0.0022 at 3 months, and p = 0.045 at six months after the surgery. Roux-en-Y duodenojejunal anastomosis appears to be superior to the classical gastrojejunal anastomosis while restoring patency of the gastrointestinal passage in the case of upper bowel obstruction."
29953548," Uncaria macrophylla Wall. is an important Chinese medicinal herb. Rhynchophylline (RIN) and isorhynchophylline (IRN) are its major active compounds. We investigated the influence of genetic differentiation and environmental factors on the RIN and IRN to find the main influencing factors of their contents and lay the foundation for the following cultivation and breeding. We used inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers to investigate the genetic diversity, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to measure the contents of RIN and IRN in 200 samples of U. macrophylla obtained from nine natural populations, and then to analyze the correlation between genetic differentiation, environmental factors of sampling sites and the contents of RIN and IRN. We found that High intra-population (80.05%) and low inter-population (19.95%) genetic diversity existed in the samples of U. macrophylla. To some extent, genetic differentiation and the contents of RIN and IRN had correlation in individual populations (such as JH, MH, XM, and ML). The RIN and IRN contents were significant negatively correlated with the precipitation in May (RIRN = -0.771, p = 0.015) and June (RRIN = -0.814, p = 0.008; RIRN = -0.921, p = 0.000), indicating that precipitation was the main affecting factor of their contents. Interestingly, the analysis results showed that the RIN content had a significant positive correlation (r = 0.585, p = 0.000) with the IRN content (they are isomers); the proportion of RIN had a significant negative correlation with the sum of the two (r = -0.390, p<0.0001), while the proportion of IRN had a significant positive correlation (r = 0.390, p<0.0001). It meant that, with the total quantity of the two compounds increased, the proportion of RIN decreased and the proportion of IRN increased, illustrating that their conversion exist some regularity. Moreover, the content ratio of RIN and IRN was significant positively correlated with the January precipitation (r = 0.716, p = 0.030), implying that January may be the key period for the mutual transformation of RIN and IRN."
29953547," To prevent the global health burdens of human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] and unintended/mistimed pregnancies, we developed an intravaginal ring [IVR] that delivers tenofovir [TFV] at ~10mg/day alone or with levonorgestrel [LNG] at ~20μg/day for 90 days. We present safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, acceptability and drug release data in healthy women. CONRAD A13-128 was a randomized, placebo controlled phase I study. We screened 86 women; 51 were randomized to TFV, TFV/LNG or placebo IVR [2:2:1] and 50 completed all visits, using the IVR for approximately 15 days. We assessed safety by adverse events, colposcopy, vaginal microbiota, epithelial integrity, mucosal histology and immune cell numbers and phenotype, cervicovaginal [CV] cytokines and antimicrobial proteins and changes in systemic laboratory measurements, and LNG and TFV pharmacokinetics in multiple compartments. TFV pharmacodynamic activity was measured by evaluating CV fluid [CVF] and tissue for antiviral activity using in vitro models. LNG pharmacodynamic assessments were timed based on peak urinary luteinizing hormone levels. All IVRs were safe with no significant colposcopic, mucosal, immune and microbiota changes and were acceptable. Among TFV containing IVR users, median and mean CV aspirate TFV concentrations remained above 100,000 ng/mL 4 hours post IVR insertion and mean TFV-diphosphate [DP] concentrations in vaginal tissue remained above 1,000 fmol/mg even 3 days post IVR removal. CVF of women using TFV-containing IVRs completely inhibited [94-100%] HIV infection in vitro. TFV/LNG IVR users had mean serum LNG concentrations exceeding 300 pg/mL within 1 hour, remaining high throughout IVR use. All LNG IVR users had a cervical mucus Insler score <10 and the majority [95%] were anovulatory or had abnormal cervical mucus sperm penetration. Estimated in vivo TFV and LNG release rates were within expected ranges. All IVRs were safe with the active ones delivering sustained high concentrations of TFV locally. LNG caused changes in cervical mucus, sperm penetration, and ovulation compatible with contraceptive efficacy. The TFV and TFV/LNG rings are ready for expanded 90 day clinical testing. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT02235662."
29953546," Numerous studies have evaluated the efficacy of interventions to reduce risk for sexually transmitted infections in adolescents in recent years, but their global effects remain unknown since 2008, the last date of a comprehensive review of prior studies. This study aims at evaluating the efficacy of interventions to promote sexual health, reduce STIs and unplanned pregnancies targeted to adolescents available after 2008; and analyzing the moderators of their global efficacy. We searched electronic databases and manual searches of some journals focused on STIs in May 2016. The studies evaluated the efficacy of interventions to reduce sexual risk in adolescents (age range: 11-19) anywhere in the world. Effect size of the relevant outcomes for sexual risk was calculated for every study. Analyses incorporated random-effect assumptions for each outcome. The homogeneity in the results was examined with the I2 statistic and its associated 95% confident interval. Data from 63 studies (59,795 participants) were analyzed for behavioral and non-behavioral outcomes. In the short term, interventions had a positive impact in sexual health-related knowledge (Hedges'g = 1.01), attitudes (g = 0.29), self-efficacy toward condom use (g = 0.22), intention to refuse sex (g = 0.56), condom use intention (g = 0.46), and condom use (g = 0.38). In the medium term, positive effects observed at the short-term were maintained, although effect size significantly decreased in all variables. In the long term, interventions improved condom use (g = 0.47). Moderators of the efficacy are discussed. Sexual health promotion interventions are effective to promote sexual health through increasing condom use. Effects on non-behavioral variables tend to decrease over time, while condom use increased in the long-term. Interventions should focus on the long-term efficacy, especially in behavioral and biological measures."

29953544," While schistosomiasis remains a significant health problem in low to middle income countries, it also represents a recently recognised threat to more economically-developed regions. Until a vaccine is developed, this neglected infectious disease is primarily controlled by praziquantel, a drug with a currently unknown mechanism of action. By further elucidating how Schistosoma molecular components cooperate to regulate parasite developmental processes, next generation targets will be identified. Here, we continue our studies on schistosome epigenetic participants and characterise the function of a DNA methylation reader, the Schistosoma mansoni methyl-CpG-binding domain protein (SmMBD2/3). Firstly, we demonstrate that SmMBD2/3 contains amino acid features essential for 5-methyl cytosine (5mC) binding and illustrate that adult schistosome nuclear extracts (females > males) contain this activity. We subsequently show that SmMBD2/3 translocates into nuclear compartments of transfected murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and recombinant SmMBD2/3 exhibits 5mC binding activity. Secondly, using a yeast-two hybrid (Y2H) screen, we show that SmMBD2/3 interacts with the chromo shadow domain (CSD) of an epigenetic adaptor, S. mansoni chromobox protein (SmCBX). Moreover, fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) mediated co-localisation of Smmbd2/3 and Smcbx to mesenchymal cells as well as somatic- and reproductive- stem cells confirms the Y2H results and demonstrates that these interacting partners are ubiquitously expressed and found within both differentiated as well as proliferating cells. Finally, using RNA interference, we reveal that depletion of Smmbd2/3 or Smcbx in adult females leads to significant reductions (46-58%) in the number of proliferating somatic stem cells (PSCs or neoblasts) as well as in the quantity of in vitro laid eggs. Collectively, these results further expand upon the schistosome components involved in epigenetic processes and suggest that pharmacological inhibition of SmMBD2/3 and/or SmCBX biology could prove useful in the development of future schistosomiasis control strategies."
29953543," KCa3.1 (also known as SK4 or IK1) is a mammalian intermediate-conductance potassium channel that plays a critical role in the activation of T cells, B cells, and mast cells, effluxing potassium ions to maintain a negative membrane potential for influxing calcium ions. KCa3.1 shares primary sequence similarity with three other (low-conductance) potassium channels: KCa2.1, KCa2.2, and KCa2.3 (also known as SK1-3). These four homotetrameric channels bind calmodulin (CaM) in the cytoplasmic region, and calcium binding to CaM triggers channel activation. Unique to KCa3.1, activation also requires phosphorylation of a single histidine residue, His358, in the cytoplasmic region, which relieves copper-mediated inhibition of the channel. Near the cytoplasmic C-terminus of KCa3.1 (and KCa2.1-2.3), secondary-structure analysis predicts the presence of a coiled-coil/heptad repeat. Here, we report the crystal structure of the C-terminal coiled-coil region of KCa3.1, which forms a parallel four-helix bundle, consistent with the tetrameric nature of the channel. Interestingly, the four copies of a histidine residue, His389, in an 'a' position within the heptad repeat, are observed to bind a copper ion along the four-fold axis of the bundle. These results suggest that His358, the inhibitory histidine in KCa3.1, might coordinate a copper ion through a similar binding mode."

29953539," OpenSim musculoskeletal models of the head and neck can provide information about muscle activity and the response of the head and neck to a variety of situations. Previous models report weak flexion strength, which is partially due to lacking moment generating capacity in the upper cervical spine. Previous models have also lacked realistic hyoid muscles, which have the capability to improve flexion strength and control in the upper cervical spine. Suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles were incorporated in an OpenSim musculoskeletal model of the head and neck. This model was based on previous OpenSim models, and now includes hyoid muscles and passive elements. The moment generating capacity of the model was tested by simulating physical experiments in the OpenSim environment. The flexor and extensor muscle strengths were scaled to match static experimental results. Models with and without hyoid muscles were used to simulate experimentally captured motions, and the need for reserve actuators was evaluated. The addition of hyoid muscles greatly increased flexion strength, and the model is the first of its kind to have realistic strength values in all directions. Less reserve actuator moment was required to simulate real motions with the addition of hyoid muscles. Several additional ways of improving flexion strength were investigated. Hyoid muscles add control and strength to OpenSim musculoskeletal models of the head and neck and improve simulations of head and neck movements."
29953538," Cholestatic patients exhibiting high bile acid serum levels were reported to be more susceptible to bacterial and viral infections. Animal studies in bile duct ligated (BDL) mice suggest that cholestasis leads to an aggravation of hepatic bacterial infections. We have investigated the impact of cholestasis on mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-induced immune responses and viral replication. While MCMV did not aggravate BDL-induced liver damage, BDL markedly reduced MCMV-triggered chemokine expression and immune cell recruitment to the liver. MCMV-infected BDL mice showed diminished trafficking of Ly6C+/F4/80+ myeloid cells and NK1.1+ NK cells to the liver compared to MCMV infected control mice. Moreover, virus-driven expression of CCL7, CCL12, CXCL9 and CXCL10 was clearly impaired in BDL- compared to sham-operated mice. Furthermore, production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was massively augmented in infected BDL mice. In contrast, intra- and extrahepatic virus replication was unaltered in BDL-MCMV mice when compared to sham-MCMV mice. Cholestasis in the BDL model severely impaired pathogen-induced chemokine expression in the liver affecting CCR2- and CXCR3-dependent cell trafficking. Cholestasis resulted in reduced recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and NK cells to the liver."
29953537," Perceived social support relates to infertility-related distress in couples undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment. Studies examining the effect of other support types on both positive and negative adjustment among infertile couples are scarce or non-existent. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of support receipt, provision, invisibility (the discrepancy between one partner's received and the other partner's provided support), and equity (the discrepancy between each partner's received and provided support) on the positive (life purpose) and negative (depressive symptoms) indices of well-being in couples undergoing ART treatment. Depressive symptoms (CES-D), life purpose (PIL), and social support (BSSS) were assessed among 31 married couples (mean age 32.67 years) undergoing ART treatment. Data were analyzed by applying the Actor-Partner-Interdependence Model (APIM) using multilevel modeling. Both receiving and providing support had beneficial effects in women and men. However, sub-analysis showed differences according to gender and the support exchange effects. Women reported higher depression and lower life purpose but benefited more from support, and their well-being was more dependent on their own perception of support provision and receipt. Men demonstrated higher adjustment to infertility but benefited less from support, and their well-being was mostly correlated with supportive behaviors of their wives. Adjustment mechanisms of women and men undergoing ART treatment vary considerably; thus, gender should be taken into consideration in interventions. Future studies should focus on costs/benefits and gender differences of visible and invisible support in infertility settings."
29953536," Whether statins and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) / angiotensin receptor blockors (ARBs) are associated with reduced risks of infection events is still inconclusive. This study aimed to explore the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia among patients who had received treatment with ACEIs/ARBs and/or statins using a population-based dataset. This study included 19,281 patients as cases who were hospitalized for pneumonia and 19,281 controls. We used a logistic regression to compute the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for having previously used statins or an ACEI/ ARB between patients who were hospitalized for pneumonia treatment and controls. We found there were significant associations between hospitalization for pneumonia and statin-only users (p<0.001), ACEI/ARB-only users (p<0.001), and statin and ACEI/ARB users (p<0.001). The logistic regression analysis suggested that statin-only users (adjusted OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.34~0.43), ACEI/ARB-only users (adjusted OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.82~0.91), and statin and ACEI/ARB users (adjusted OR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.44~0.50) were all less likely to be hospitalized for pneumonia treatment than were non-users. Furthermore, we found that statin-only users (adjusted OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.40~0.50) and statin and ACEI/ARB users (adjusted OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.52~0.58) were less likely to be hospitalized for pneumonia treatment compared to ACEI-only users. However, combined statin and ACEI/ARB users (adjusted OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.10~1.40) were more likely to have been hospitalized for pneumonia treatment compared to statin-only users. Although we found use of both statins and ACEI/ARB were significantly associated with a lower risk of pneumonia, the combination of the two medications did not provide additional protection against pneumonia risk."
29953535," In the context of colorectal cancer screening, we aimed to compare the effectiveness of different emotion-laden narratives, to investigate the specific emotions elicited at both subjective and physiological levels, and to test the effects of emotions explicitly expressed by the narrative character. Study 1 used a between-participants design comparing four conditions: relief-based narrative, regret-based narrative, control (test-uptake only) narrative, and standard invitation material (no-narrative condition). Study 2 used a mixed design, with the narrative content as a within-participants factor and whether emotions were expressed by the narrative character or not as between-participants factor. The main outcome measures were: intention to undergo testing (Studies 1 and 2), knowledge, risk perception, proportion of informed choices (Study 1), subjective emotional responses, changes in skin conductance, heart rate, and corrugator muscle activity (Study 2). In Study 1, relative to the non-narrative condition (51%), only the relief-based narrative significantly increased intention to undergo testing (86%). Relative to the standard invitation material, the narrative conditions did not decrease knowledge, alter risk perception, or decrease the proportion of informed choices. In Study 2, the relief-based narrative elicited the lowest self-reported negative affect, and received greater implicit attention, as suggested by the larger heart rate decrease. Making the emotions experienced by the narrative character explicit decreased negative affect, as indicated by the lower skin conductance and corrugator responses during reading. Our findings provide support for the use of a relief-based narrative with emotions expressed by the character in addition to the standard information material to promote colorectal cancer screening."
29953534," Here we provide new technology for generating human peptidergic nociceptive sensory neurons in a straightforward and efficient way. The cellular source, human epidermal neural crest stem cells (hEPI-NCSC), consists of multipotent somatic stem cells that reside in the bulge of hair follicles. hEPI-NCSC and primary sensory neurons have a common origin, the embryonic neural crest. For directed differentiation, hEPI-NCSC were exposed to pertinent growth factors and small molecules in order to modulate master signalling networks involved in differentiation of neural crest cells into postmitotic peptidergic sensory neurons during embryonic development. The neuronal populations were homogenous in regard to antibody marker expression. Cells were immunoreactive for essential master regulatory genes, including NGN1/2, SOX10, and BRN3a among others, and for the pain-mediating genes substance P (SP), calcitonin gene related protein (CGRP) and the TRPV1 channel. Approximately 30% of total cells responded to capsaicin, indicating that they expressed an active TRPV1 channel. In summary, hEPI-NCSC are a biologically relevant and easily available source of somatic stem cells for generating human peptidergic nociceptive neurons without the need for genetic manipulation and cell purification. As no analgesics exist that specifically target TRPV1, a ready supply of high-quality human peptidergic nociceptive sensory neurons could open the way for new approaches, in a biologically relevant cellular context, to drug discovery and patient-specific disease modelling that is aimed at pain control, and as such is highly desirable."

29953532," Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in children. This study investigated the use of rehabilitation treatment in Taiwan. We selected children aged 3-12 years from the National Health Insurance Research Database from 2008 to 2012 and included them in the analysis. The children who received a diagnosis according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification were divided into two groups: ADHD and non-ADHD. We used the chi-squared test, independent sample t test, and multiple regression analysis to conduct the analysis. The utilisation of rehabilitation resources was higher in the ADHD group than in the non-ADHD group. The number of school-aged children with ADHD was higher than the number of preschool-aged children (p < 0.001). The highest utilisation of rehabilitation resources was observed in clinics (p < 0.001). In terms of region, Taipei exhibited the highest utilisation of rehabilitation resources, and the East exhibited the lowest resource utilisation (p < 0.001). Prediction of the use of rehabilitation resources, average cost, average frequency of visits, and total annual cost was affected by factors such as the average frequency of rehabilitation use, demographic characteristics, and the hospital characteristics and location (p < 0.001). The number of children with ADHD and rehabilitation use are increasing yearly; however, limitations in payment restrict the growth of rehabilitation resource use in hospitals. Supplementation of rehabilitation resources at clinics accounts for more than 60%, however, the total annual cost is less than what is observed for hospitals (p < 0.001). Policies should be established to aid in the early detection and treatment of children with ADHD to improve treatment outcomes and reduce the family burden and treatment expenditure in the future."
29953531," Phytotoxic effects of phenolic compounds have been extensively studied, but less attention has been given to the effects of these compounds on soil microbial communities, which are crucial to the productivity of agricultural systems. Responses of cucumber rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities to syringic acid (SA), a phenolic compound with autotoxicity to cucumber, were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer amplicons. SA at the concentration of 0.1 μmol g-1 soil changed rhizosphere bacterial and fungal community compositions, decreased bacterial community diversity but increased fungal community richness and diversity (P<0.05). Moreover, SA increased the relative abundances of bacterial phylum Proteobacteria and fungal classes Leotiomycetes, Pezizomycetes, Tremellomycetes and Eurotiomycetes, but decreased the relative abundances of bacterial phylum Firmicutes and fungal class Sordariomycetes (P<0.05). At the genus level, SA decreased the relative abundances of microbial taxa with pathogen-antagonistic and/or plant growth promoting potentials, such as Pseudomonas spp. (P<0.05). Real-time PCR validated that SA decreased cucumber rhizosphere Pseudomonas spp. abundance (P<0.05). In vitro study showed that SA (0.01 to 10 mM) inhibited the growth of a strain of Pseudomonas spp. with pathogen-antagonistic activities to cucumber pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cucumerinum Owen (P<0.05). Overall, SA changed cucumber rhizosphere bacterial and fungal community compositions, which may exert negative effects on cucumber seedling growth through inhibiting plant-beneficial microorganisms."
29953530," Little is known regarding consequences of climate change on riparian plant functional types (PFTs) related to leaf traits, with putative domino effects on stream food webs, plausible even if the tipping point of stream-desiccation is not reached. We hypothesized that, as stream food-webs are highly dependent on riparian subsidies, climate change might alter PFTs to the point of weakening terrestrial-aquatic linkages. We conducted a gradient analysis to assess the relative effects of climate, soil and riparian physical characteristics on PFTs. If PFTs differ significantly in leaf traits and climate had major influences on them, we could assume space-for-time interchangeability forward in time to predict leaf traits changes, and consequences for stream food webs under future climate change scenarios. Results indicated a clear distinction in leaf traits among PFTs: woody deciduous plants showed leaf traits associated to high decomposability and nutritional value for invertebrate shredders compared to evergreen woody and giant graminoid groups. We found a prime role of climate predicting changes in abundance and diversity of PFTs: 1) a warming and precipitation-decline scenario, coupled with soil characteristics related to aridification, would have detrimental effects on deciduous plants, while fostering giant graminoids; 2) in a scenario of no precipitation-reduction in wetter areas, warming might promote the expansion of evergreen to the detriment of deciduous plants. In both scenarios the net outcome implies increasing recalcitrance of leaf litter inputs, potentially weakening terrestrial-aquatic linkages in headwater streams."
29953529," New York City has had a long history of implementing local policies to reduce air pollution. Enacted as a part of PlaNYC, the Clean Heat policies aim to lower wintertime ambient air pollution by phasing out dirty No. 6 heating fuel oil and transitioning to comparatively cleaner No. 4, No. 2, or natural gas. This study evaluates the impacts of policies on ambient air pollution and, given that people spend the majority of their time inside, importantly, indoor air pollution. Using a natural experiment, we evaluate the effects of the policies by measuring average two-week levels of indoor and outdoor black carbon (BC) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in 48 upper Manhattan apartments in successive winter heating seasons before and after mandated fuel transition. We failed to observe systematic improvements in indoor BC and PM2.5 concentrations in follow-up. However, outdoor levels of PM2.5 did improve, with statistical differences observed among buildings converting to the cleanest fuels. Non-statistical improvements were observed for outdoor BC. However, when accounting for meteorological differences, apartment characteristics, and behavioral patterns that may have influenced air pollution measurements, these differences were not significant. The study results have important policy and equity implications considering the differential improvements in air quality by conversion to No. 4 oil as compared to the cleaner No. 2 oil and natural gas."
29953528," Heparin therapy and prophylaxis may be accompanied by bleeding and thrombotic complications due to individual responses to treatment. Dosage control based on standard laboratory assays poorly reflects the effect of the therapy. The aim of our work was to compare the heparin sensitivity of new thrombodynamics (TD) assay with sensitivity of other standard and global coagulation tests available to date. A total of 296 patients with high risk of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis (DVT), early postoperative period, hemoblastosis) were enrolled in the study. We used a case-crossover design to evaluate the sensitivity of new thrombodynamics assay (TD) to the hemostatic state before and after unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) therapy/prophylaxis and to compare it with the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), anti-Xa activity test, thrombin generation test (TGT) and thromboelastography (TEG). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate changes before and after heparin prophylaxis and therapy. Blood was sampled before heparin injection, at the time of maximal blood heparin concentration and before the next injection. Hypercoagulation before the start of heparin treatment was detected by TD, TGT and TEG but not by APTT. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was maximal for TD and anti-Xa, intermediate for TGT and TEG and minimal for APTT. These results indicate that TD has a high sensitivity to the effects of UFH and LMWH after both prophylactic and therapeutic regimes and may be used for heparin monitoring."
29953527," Considering that there is a lack of evidence regarding the contribution of library and information services to evidence-based medicine in actual clinical practice in Japan, the purpose of the study is to explore the current status of use and value of library and information services in clinical settings to examine the usefulness of information in implementing evidence-based medicine (EBM) into practice. A Web-based survey was conducted at seven sites (hospitals with 300-1,200 beds) and interviews conducted at five sites to investigate information behavior among health professionals (physicians, residents, and nurses) in 2016, replicating the Value Study carried out in the United States in 2010 and 2011. Using a critical incident technique, respondents answered questions about their information topics, information resources used, search location, access points, and evaluation of the information. Analysis from 598 valid responses (275 physicians, 55 residents, and 268 nurses) revealed the characteristics of information use and recognition of the value of information. Physicians and residents showed their information needs regarding clinical care using PubMed (80.4%, 65.5%), Ichushi-Web (61.8%, 63.6%), and UpToDate (40.4%, 65.5%). While physicians rely more on electronic journals (37.8%), residents use more hybrid resources including Japanese print books (38.2%) and online books (30.9% for Japanese, 32.7% for English) to confirm their knowledge. Nurses need more information close to patients and explore a wider variety of information resources such as Japanese print books (60.4%), Ichushi -Web (40.3%), Japanese online books (20.5%), and websites of academic organizations (19.0%). Although the overall recognition of the value of information was relatively modest, concrete changes in clinical practice were found in some areas. Environments with insufficient information and availability of electronic resources should be improved to increase the use of library and information services for implementing EBM."
29953526," The increasing focus of healthcare systems worldwide on long-term care highlights the need for culturally sensitive Health-Related Quality of Life instruments to accurately capture perceived health of various populations. Such instruments require a contextualized conceptual framework of health domains, which is lacking in some socio-cultural contexts. We developed a comprehensive and culturally sensitive conceptual framework of health domains relevant to the Singaporean population. We recruited Singaporeans/ permanent residents, English/ Chinese-speaking, with/ without chronic illnesses to participate in focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs). We elicited health areas participants perceived to be important for them to be happy and satisfied with life. To encourage spontaneous emergence of themes, we did not specify any aspect beyond the broad domains of Physical, Mental, and Social health so as not to limit the emergence of new themes. Themes from the transcripts were distilled through open coding (two independent coders), then classified into more abstract domains (each transcript coded independently by two coders from a pool of six coders). From October 2013 to August 2014, 121 members of the general public participated in 18 FGDs and 13 IDIs (44.6% males, mean age: 53.3 years 77% Chinese, 9% Malay, 12% Indian, 63% with chronic illness) while 13 healthcare workers participated as patient-proxies in three FGDs. Thematic analysis identified 27 domains. The 15 physical domains included physical appearance, energy, physical fitness, and health and resistance to illness. The nine mental domains included emotions, self-esteem, and personal freedom. The three social domains were social contact, social relationships, and social roles. This conceptual framework reflected physical, mental, and social dimensions of well-being, suggesting that the Singapore population's views on health support the World Health Organization's definition of health as ""a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity""."
29953525," Magneto-inductive (MI) communication is a viable technology for wireless communications in underwater and underground environments. In this paper, a new design for an MI transmitter is presented. Unlike conventional MI transmitters that utilize coiled loops or solenoids to generate magnetic fields, we demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of using a rotating permanent magnet. We also present and experimentally verify a modulation technique that does not involve changing the rotational speed of the magnet. By electrically changing the permeability of a surrounding shield, the fields from the rotating magnet are amplitude modulated. Our findings suggest that increased efficiency and bandwidth can be realized compared to conventional MI transmitters."
29953524," Dysregulation of the stress response is implicated in drug addiction; therefore, polymorphisms in stress-related genes may be involved in this disease. An analysis was performed to identify associations between variants in 11 stress-related genes, selected a priori, and heroin addiction. Two discovery samples of American subjects of European descent (EA, n = 601) and of African Americans (AA, n = 400) were analyzed separately. Ancestry was verified by principal component analysis. Final sets of 414 (EA) and 562 (AA) variants were analyzed after filtering of 846 high-quality variants. The main result was an association of a non-coding SNP rs255105 in the CRH (CRF) receptor 2 gene (CRHR2), in the discovery EA sample (Pnominal = .00006; OR = 2.1; 95% CI 1.4-3.1). The association signal remained significant after permutation-based multiple testing correction. The result was corroborated by an independent EA case sample (n = 364). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that SNP rs255105 is associated with the expression of a downstream long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) gene AC005154.6. AC005154.6 is highly expressed in the pituitary but its functions are unknown. LincRNAs have been previously associated with adaptive behavior, PTSD, and alcohol addiction. Further studies are warranted to corroborate the association results and to assess the potential relevance of this lincRNA to addiction and other stress-related disorders."
29953523," Chlamydia pecorum is a mucosal infection, which causes debilitating disease of the urinary tract, reproductive tract and ocular sites of koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus). While antibiotics are available for treatment, they are detrimental to the koalas' gastrointestinal tract microflora leaving the implementation of a vaccine as an ideal option for the long-term management of koala populations. We have previously reported on the successes of an anti-chlamydial recombinant major outer membrane protein (rMOMP) vaccine however, recombinant protein based vaccines are not ideal candidates for scale up from the research level to small-medium production level for wider usage. Peptide based vaccines are a promising area for vaccine development, because peptides are stable, cost effective and easily produced. In this current study, we assessed, for the first time, the immune responses to a synthetic peptide based anti-chlamydial vaccine in koalas. Five healthy male koalas were vaccinated with two synthetic peptides derived from C. pecorum MOMP and another five healthy male koalas were vaccinated with full length recombinant C. pecorum MOMP (genotype G). Systemic (IgG) and mucosal (IgA) antibodies were quantified and pre-vaccination levels compared to post-vaccination levels (12 and 26 weeks). MOMP-peptide vaccinated koalas produced Chlamydia-specific IgG and IgA antibodies, which were able to recognise not only the genotype used in the vaccination, but also MOMPs from several other koala C. pecorum genotypes. In addition, IgA antibodies induced at the ocular site not only recognised recombinant MOMP protein but also, whole native chlamydial elementary bodies. Interestingly, some MOMP-peptide vaccinated koalas showed a stronger and more sustained vaccine-induced mucosal IgA antibody response than observed in MOMP-protein vaccinated koalas. These results demonstrate that a synthetic MOMP peptide based vaccine is capable of inducing a Chlamydia-specific antibody response in koalas and is a promising candidate for future vaccine development."
29953522," NF-κB is an important mediator of immune activity and its activation is essential in mounting immune response to pathogens. Here, we describe the optimization and implementation of a high-throughput screening platform that utilizes high content imaging and analysis to monitor NF-κB nuclear translocation. We screened 38,991 compounds from three different small molecule libraries and identified 103 compound as hits; 31% of these were active in a dose response assay. Several of the molecules lacked cytotoxicity or had a selectivity index of more than 2-fold. Our image-based approach provides an important first step towards identifying small molecules with immunomodulatory activity."
29953521," Radioresistance is one of the main determinants of treatment outcome in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), but its prediction is difficult. Several authors aimed to establish radioresistant OSCC cell lines to identify genes with altered expression in response to radioresistance. The development of OSCC is a multistep carcinogenic process that includes activation of several oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes. TGM-3 is a tumour suppressor gene and contributes to carcinogenesis process. The aim of this study was to estimate serum and tissue expression of TGM-3 and its correlation with clinico-pathological factors and overall survival in patients of OSCC undergoing chemo-radiotherapy. Tissue expression was observed in formalin fixed tissue biopsies of 96 cases of OSCC and 32 healthy controls were subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC) by using antibody against TGM-3 and serum level was estimated by ELISA method. mRNA expression was determined by using Real-Time PCR. Patients were followed for 2 year for chemo radiotherapy response. In OSCC, 76.70% cases and in controls 90.62% were positive for TGM-3 IHC expression. TGM-3 expression was cytoplasmic and nuclear staining expressed in keratinized layer, stratum granulosum and stratum spinosum in controls and tumour cells. Mean serum TGM-3 in pre chemo-radiotherapy OSCC cases were 1304.83±573.55, post chemo-radiotherapy samples were 1530.64±669.33 and controls were 1869.16±1377.36, but difference was significant in pre chemo-radiotherapy samples as compared to controls (p<0.018). This finding was also confirmed by real- time PCR analysis in which down regulation (-7.92 fold change) of TGM-3 in OSCC as compared to controls. TGM-3 expression was significantly associated with response to chemo-radiotherapy treatment (p<0.007) and overall survival (p<0.015). Patents having higher level of TGM-3 expression have good response to chemo-radiotherapy and also have better overall survival. TGM-3 may serve as a candidate biomarker for responsiveness to chemo-radiotherapy treatment in OSCC patients."
29953520," Infection with, and treatment of HIV is associated with effects on glycaemia and renal function. The purpose of this study was therefore to compare glycaemic control and albuminuria in HIV-positive and HIV-negative type 2 diabetic patients. Diabetic patients with and without HIV infection were recruited from a diabetic clinic at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, South Africa. Data was collected on weight, height, HbA1c, fasting glucose, urine albumin:creatinine ratio, HIV status, CD4 counts, viral load and concomitant therapies. Multivariable regression analysis was used to isolate the determinants of fasting glucose and HbA1c levels and risk factors for albuminuria. Data were collected from 106 HIV-positive and 214 HIV-negative diabetics. All HIV infected subjects were receiving anti-retroviral therapy. The determinants of fasting glucose levels (log) were HIV infection (β = 0.04, p = 0.01) and use of anti-hypertensive agents (β = 0.07, p = 0.0006), whilst for HbA1c levels (log) they were HIV infection (β = -0.03, p = 0.03), BMI (β = 0.004, p = 0.0005), statin use (β = 0.04, p = 0.002) and glucose levels (β = 0.01, p<0.0005). In HIV-positive subjects, CD4 counts were negatively associated with glucose levels (β = -0.0002, p = 0.03). The risk factors for albuminuria were (odds ratio [95% CIs]) dyslipidaemia (1.94 [1.09, 3.44], p = 0.02) and HbA1c levels (1.24 [1.12, 1.38], p<0.0001). These data suggest that glycaemic control is worse in type 2 diabetic subjects with HIV infection and that HbA1c underestimates glycaemia in these patients. Albuminuria was not associated with HIV-positivity. The negative relationship of CD4 counts with glucose levels may reflect viral removal and easing of the associated inflammatory response. It is possible that the association of statin and anti-hypertensive therapies with high HbA1c and glucose levels, respectively, is due to such therapies being given largely to subjects with poor glycaemic control."
29953519," To solve the hidden danger of high methane and low permeability gas in the coal mining process, potentially affecting the safety production in an orderly way, we propose the use of deep hole blasting technology to improve the permeability of the coal seam gas drainage, increase the quantity and rate of extraction, and reduce methane output. Taking the geological conditions of the 201 working surface of Tingnan Coal Mine as an example, it is calculated that the single drilled fracture crack extension range is 3.11~5.24 m according to the coal seam deep-hole pre-splitting blasting joint mechanism and fracture propagation mechanics model, providing a theoretical basis for choosing the appropriate hole spacing. Using COMSOL simulation software to simulate the effective gas drainage radius of a coal seam from a two-dimensional perspective on a single borehole radial, the least squares fitting method was used to analyze the simulated data, and obtained the effective drilling extraction radius after pre-split blasting in a deep hole that is 3.6 m, which is in accordance with the theoretical calculations. In order to obtain accurate and scientific calculations, Fast lagrangian analysis of continua (FLAC3D) numerical simulation software was used. After simulating the distribution of plastic zone between two blast holes at different intervals from a three-dimensional angle, and evaluating the development of cracks in the blasting hole, the white zone of the blasting space was completely eliminated when the interval between blasting holes was 7 m, and the cracks could be propagated throughout the surroundings. Therefore, a blasting hole spacing of 7 m is optimal. On-site monitoring in the Nanting coal mine showed that the quantity and rate of extraction of the single hole after pre-splitting blasting were 2.36 times and 1.62 times as much as before. By integrating the borehole drainage amount and the optimized calculation equation, it could be concluded that the permeability coefficient of the coal seam after blasting was 7.78 times as much as before. The function of time-variated drilling methane emission was obtained using multivariate statistical regressions based on the on-site monitored borehole methane emission (qt), and the drilling limit after pre-splitting blasting revealed that the limitation of methane extraction volume was 5.27 times as much as before."
29953518," The aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) are commonly used compound surrogates for advanced fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. However, the use of APRI and FIB-4 entails a risk of overestimating the fibrosis stage due to the impact of necroinflammatory activity on transaminases. We sought to investigate the optimal cutoff values of the two compound surrogates for predicting cirrhosis stratified by AST level. This retrospective study enrolled 1716 treatment-naive CHC patients who underwent liver biopsy prior to interferon therapy from 1997-2010. Fibrosis was scored according to the modified Knodell classification. The upper limit for normal AST in our hospital is 37 IU/L. We stratified the enrolled patients into the categories of AST≤37 IU/L (N = 132), 37<AST≤74, (N = 501), 74<AST≤148 IU/L (N = 737), and AST>148 IU/L (N = 346). 436 patients had cirrhosis (F4). The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) analysis results distinguishing cirrhosis (F4) from non-cirrhosis (F0-F3) were 0.81 for APRI and 0.85 for FIB-4 in patients with AST≤37 IU/L; 0.71 for APRI and 0.72 for FIB-4 in patients with 37<AST≤74IU/L; 0.72 for APRI and 0.73 for FIB-4 in patients with 74<AST≤148 IU/L; and 0.68 for APRI and 0.70 for FIB-4 in patients with AST>148 IU/L. The optimal cutoff values of APRI and FIB-4 for the diagnosis of cirrhosis were 0.6 and 1.4, respectively, in patients with AST≤37 IU/L; 1.1 and 2.2, respectively, in patients with 37<AST≤74 IU/L; 2.2 and 3.4, respectively, in patients with 74<AST≤148 IU/L; and 3.4 and 5.5, respectively, in patients with AST>148 IU/L. We provide optimal cutoff values of both APRI and FIB-4 to predict cirrhosis stratified by AST levels, which should be more feasible compared with the single cutoff values proposed in previous studies."
29953517," The interest in the promotion of entrepreneurship is significantly increasing, particularly in those countries, such as Italy, that suffered during the recent great economic recession and subsequently needed to revitalize their economy. Entrepreneurial intention (EI) is a crucial stage in the entrepreneurial process and represents the basis for consequential entrepreneurial actions. Several research projects have sought to understand the antecedents of EI. This study, using a situational approach, has investigated the personal and contextual determinants of EI, exploring gender differences. In particular, the mediational role of general self-efficacy between internal locus of control (LoC), self-regulation, and support from family and friends, on the one hand, and EI, on the other hand, has been investigated. The study involved a sample of 658 Italian participants, of which 319 were male and 339 were female. Data were collected with a self-report on-line questionnaire and analysed with SPSS 23 and Mplus 7 to test a multi-group structural equation model. The results showed that self-efficacy totally mediated the relationship between internal LoC, self-regulation and EI. Moreover, it partially mediated the relationship between support from family and friends and EI. All the relations were significant for both men and women; however, our findings highlighted a stronger relationship between self-efficacy and EI for men, and between support from family and friends and both self-efficacy and EI for women. Findings highlighted the role of contextual characteristics in addition to personal ones in influencing EI and confirmed the key mediational function of self-efficacy. As for gender, results suggested that differences between men and women in relation to the entrepreneur role still exist. Practical implications for trainers and educators are discussed."
29953516," Yonaguni Island is a remote and isolated westernmost island in Japan, which is the fastest aging country in the world. This study evaluated the current status of medical supply-and-demand on the island and compared these results with previous surveys carried out in rural parts of Japan. This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at the Yonaguni Municipal Clinic, the only medical facility in Yonaguni Island. The participants were patients who visited the clinic over one year, between July 2015 and June 2016. We calculated the rate per 1,000 persons per month of clinic visits, referrals to off-island medical facilities (e.g., hospitals and specialist clinics), referrals to off-island emergency departments, off-island hospitalizations after referral, home visits, and overnight observations at the clinic. In total, 6,197 patients (males, 46.3%) visited the clinic. The rate of clinic visits per 1,000 persons per month was 516.4 (Standard deviation [SD] 28.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 500.5-532.3). The rate per 1,000 persons per month was 14.0 (SD 3.9, 95% CI: 11.8-16.2) for off-island referrals, 3.8 (SD 2.1, 95% CI: 2.6-5.0) for referrals to emergency departments, 4.8 (SD 2.6, 95% CI: 3.3-6.2) for hospitalizations, and 3.2 (SD 1.7, 95% CI: 2.2-4.1) for home visits. The rate of clinic visits was higher in Yonaguni Island than in other rural areas, although the rate of off-island referrals was lower. There were no significant differences between the number of referrals to emergency departments, hospitalizations, and home visits in Yonaguni Island, in comparison to other studies. Our study showed that patients presenting with emergencies had similar rates of healthcare-seeking behavior to those reported in previous studies in Japan; however, the referral rate was lower. We assessed the ecology of medical care in this district by evaluating patient behavior on an isolated island where access to medical care is geographically limited."
29953515," Here high-speed Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) records sperm flagellar waveforms and swimming paths in 4 dimensions (X, Z, and t). We find flagellar excursions into the Z-plane nearly as large as the envelope of the flagellar waveform projected onto the XY-plane. These Z-plane excursions travel as waves down the flagellum each beat cycle. DHM also tracks the heads of free-swimming sperm and the dynamics and chirality of rolling of sperm around their long axis. We find that mouse sperm roll CW at the maximum positive Z-plane excursion of the head, then roll CCW at the subsequent maximum negative Z-plane excursion. This alternating chirality of rolling indicates sperm have a chiral memory. Procrustes alignments of path trajectories for sequences of roll-counterroll cycles show that path chirality is always CW for the cells analyzed in this study. Human and bull sperm lack distinguishable left and right surfaces, but DHM still indicates coordination of Z-plane excursions and rolling events. We propose that sperm have a chiral memory that resides in a hypothetical elastic linkage within the flagellar machinery, which stores some of the torque required for a CW or CCW roll to reuse in the following counter-roll. Separate mechanisms control path chirality."
29953514," Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common adverse effect of opioid-based intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA). Nefopam has been considered as a good candidate for inclusion in multimodal analgesia because of its opioid sparing effect, but it can be emetic. This study aims to examine whether the use of nefopam combined with fentanyl in IV PCA was associated with the higher incidence of PONV in patients receiving prophylactic ramosetron after gynecological surgery. Data from 296 patients who underwent gynecological surgery were retrospectively reviewed. The patients received IV PCA containing either fentanyl 1500 μg and ketorolac 90 mg (Group K) or fentanyl 1500 μg and nefopam 80 mg (Group N). All patients in both groups received 0.3 mg of ramosetron at the end of surgery. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of PONV during the 3-day postoperative period. No difference was observed in the incidence of PONV during the 3-day postoperative period between the two groups. However, the incidence of nausea on postoperative day 2 was significantly higher in Group N (10.3%) than in Group K (2.8%) (P = 0.016). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the use of nefopam was not associated with a higher incidence of PONV (adjusted odds ratio, 1.616; 95% confidence interval, 0.952-2.743, P = 0.076). There were no differences in postoperative pain scores between the two groups. The combined use of nefopam with fentanyl in IV PCA was not associated with the higher incidence of PONV compared with the use of ketorolac and fentanyl combination in patients who received ramosetron as PONV prophylactic agent. However, prospective trials are required for a confirmative conclusion."
29953513," The gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is frequently mutated in several tumor types including gliomas. The most prevalent mutation in gliomas is a missense mutation leading to a substitution of arginine with histidine at the residue 132 (R132H). Wild type IDH1 catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) whereas mutant IDH1 converts α-KG into D2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG). Unfortunately, there are few in vivo model systems for IDH-mutated tumors to study the effects of IDH1 mutations in tumor development. We have therefore created transgenic zebrafish lines that express various IDH1 mutants. IDH1 mutations (IDH1R132H, IDH1R132C and loss-of-function mutation IDH1G70D), IDH1wildtype or eGFP were cloned into constructs with several brain-specific promoters (Nestin, Gfap or Gata2). These constructs were injected into fertilized zebrafish eggs at the one-cell stage. In total more than ten transgenic zebrafish lines expressing various brain-specific IDH1 mutations were created. A significant increase in the level of D2HG was observed in all transgenic lines expressing IDH1R132C or IDH1R132H, but not in any of the lines expressing IDH1wildtype, IDH1G70D or eGFP. No differences in 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine and mature collagen IV levels were observed between wildtype and mutant IDH1 transgenic fish. To our surprise, we failed to identify any strong phenotype, despite increased levels of the oncometabolite D2HG. No tumors were observed, even when backcrossing with tp53-mutant fish which suggests that additional transforming events are required for tumor formation. Elevated D2HG levels could be lowered by treatment of the transgenic zebrafish with an inhibitor of mutant IDH1 activity. We have generated a transgenic zebrafish model system for mutations in IDH1 that can be used for functional analysis and drug screening. Our model systems help understand the biology of IDH1 mutations and its role in tumor formation."
29953512," For better outcomes of the primary correction of cleft lip nasal deformity, it is important to clarify the specific morphological and biomechanical consequences of major surgical maneuvers during cleft lip nose correction. In this study, a finite element model was established basing on the micro-MRI imaging of an infant specimen with unilateral complete cleft lip deformity. Alar base adduction was simulated as a medially-directed force on the lateral crus (F1); columella straightening was simulated as a laterally-directed force on the medial crus (F2); and nasal tip enhancement was simulated as an anteriorly-directed force on the intermediate crus (F3). The deformation and stress distribution consequent to each force vector or different force combinations were analyzed in details. Our biomechnical analyses suggested that W\when loaded alone, the three forces generated disparate morphological changes. The combination of different force loadings generated obviously different outcomes. F3 generated the most intensive stress when compared to F1 and F2. When F2 was loaded on top of F1-F3 combination, it further relieved nasal deviation without incurring significant increase in stress. Our simulation suggested that alar base adduction, columella straightening, and nasal tip elevation should all be included in a competent cleft lip nose correction."
29953511," Sexual aggression is prevalent and damaging in our culture, and sources of support or blame following an attack of this kind can be important influences on the recovery process. This pair of studies investigate the nature of women's blame reactions towards survivors of sexual aggression, as well as the potential for provision of sympathy and support. Specifically, we focused on the previously neglected role of female self-objectification. It was expected that increased self-objectification would lead to decreased sympathy and support, and more rape victim blame. However, results of Study 1 showed that chronic self-objectification was actually related to higher levels of sympathy and support for a rape victim. Study two built upon the limitations of study one, and examined similar questions. It was expected that women who engaged in greater self-objectification would again show greater sympathy and support for the victim, replicating study one's results, and this was supported with a different scale. The overall relationship between self-objectification and sympathy and support was driven by body-relevant control beliefs. Implications and future directions are discussed."
29953510," Quality improvement in healthcare has often been promoted as different from and more valuable than peer review and other professional self-regulation processes. In spite of attempts to harmonize these two approaches, the perception of dichotomous opposition has persisted. A sequence of events in the troubled California prison system fortuitously isolated workforce interventions from more typical quality improvement interventions. Our objectives were to (1) evaluate the relative contributions of professional accountability and quality improvement interventions to an observed decrease in population mortality and (2) explore the organizational dynamics that potentiated positive outcomes. Our retrospective mixed-methods case study correlated time-series analysis of mortality with the timing of reform interventions. Quantitative and qualitative evidence was drawn from court documents, public use files, internal databases, and other archival documents. Change point analysis reveals with 98% confidence that a significant improvement in age-adjusted natural mortality occurred in 2007, decreasing from 138.7 per 100,000 in the 1998-2006 period to 106.4 in the 2007-2009 period. The improvement in mortality occurred after implementation of accountability processes, prior to implementation of quality improvement interventions. Archival evidence supports the positive impact of physician competency assessments, robust peer review, and replacement of problem physicians. Our analysis suggests that workforce accountability provides a critical quality safeguard, and its neglect in scholarship and practice is unjustified. As with quality improvement, effective professional self-regulation requires systemic implementation of enabling policies, processes, and staff resources. The study adds to evidence that the distribution of physician performance contains a heterogeneous left skew of dyscompetence that is associated with significant harm and suggests that professional self-regulation processes such as peer review can reduce that harm. Beyond their responsibility for direct harm, dyscompetent professionals can have negative impacts on group performance. The optimal integration of professional accountability and quality improvement systems merits further investigation."
29953509," A recent analysis showed an association with new onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) and incident cancer among women. We aimed to examine the risk of cancer among patients with NOAF in general population. A retrospective cohort of 5130 patients with NOAF was identified from a random sample of one million subjects between 2005 and 2010 from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The standard incidence ratio of incident cancer and hazard ratios were calculated by modeling cumulative incidence with competing risk of death. During a mean follow-up duration of 3.4 years, 330 patients developed cancer. The standard incidence ratio of all malignancies was 1.41 (95% confidence interval 1.26-1.57), suggesting a 41% increase in cancer risk compared with the general population. The risk of cancer was higher among men or the elderly with NOAF after adjusting for confounding factors and after considering the competing risk of death. The risk of cancer was not associated with CHA2DS2-VASc score (p = 0.32) among patients with NOAF. In conclusion, patients with NOAF were associated with a higher risk of cancer. Within this group, the risk of ischemic stroke (in terms of CHADS2-VASc score) did not reflect the risk of incident cancer."
29953508," Pro-inflammatory cytokines cause pancreatic beta cell failure during the development of type 2 diabetes. This beta cell failure associates with mitochondrial dysfunction, but the precise effects of cytokines on mitochondrial respiration remain unclear. To test the hypothesis that pro-inflammatory cytokines impair glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by inhibiting oxidative ATP synthesis, we probed insulin release and real-time mitochondrial respiration in rat INS-1E insulinoma cells that were exposed to a combination of 2 ng/mL interleukin-1-beta and 50 ng/mL interferon-gamma. We show that 24-h exposure to these cytokines dampens both glucose- and pyruvate-stimulated insulin secretion (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.05, respectively), but does not affect KCl-induced insulin release. Mirroring secretory defects, glucose- and pyruvate-stimulated mitochondrial respiration are lowered after cytokine exposure (P < 0.01). Further analysis confirms that cytokine-induced mitochondrial respiratory defects occur irrespective of whether fuel oxidation is coupled to, or uncoupled from, ATP synthesis. These observations demonstrate that pro-inflammatory cytokines attenuate GSIS by restricting mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation capacity. Interleukin-1-beta and interferon-gamma also increase mitochondrial superoxide levels (P < 0.05), which may reinforce the inhibition of pyruvate oxidation, and cause a modest (20%) but significant (P < 0.01) loss of INS-1E cells. Cytokine-induced INS-1E cell failure is insensitive to palmitoleate and linoleate, which is at odds with the cytoprotection offered by unsaturated fatty acids against harm caused by nutrient excess. Our data disclose a mitochondrial mechanism for cytokine-impaired GSIS in INS-1E cells, and suggest that inflammatory and nutrient-related beta cell failure emerge, at least partly, through distinct paths."
29953507," Pre-procedural TAVI planning requires highly sophisticated and time-consuming manual measurements performed by experienced readers. Semi-automatic software may assist with partial automation of assessment of multiple parameters. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences between manual and semi-automatic measurements in terms of agreement and time. One hundred and twenty TAVI candidates referred for the retrospectively ECG-gated CTA (2nd and 3rd generation dual source CT) were evaluated. Fully manual and semi-automatic measurements of fourteen aortic root parameters were assessed in the 20% phase of the R-R interval. Reading time was compared using paired samples t-test. Inter-software agreement was calculated using the Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in a 2-way mixed effects model. Differences between manual and semi-automatic measurements were evaluated using Bland-Altman analysis. The time needed for evaluation using semi-automatic assessment (3 min 24 s ± 1 min 7 s) was significantly lower (p<0.001) compared to a fully manual approach (6 min 31 sec ± 1 min 1 sec). Excellent inter-software agreement was found (ICC = 0.93 ± 0.0; range:0.90-0.95). The same prosthesis size from manual and semi-automatic measurements was selected in 92% of cases, when sizing was based on annular area. Prosthesis sizing based on annular short diameter and perimeter agreed in 99% and 96% cases, respectively. Use of semi-automatic software in pre-TAVI evaluation results in comparable results in respect of measurements and selected valve prosthesis size, while necessary reading time is significantly lower."
29953506," Plant species disjunctions have attracted the interest of ecologists for decades. We investigated Trichloris crinita, a native C4 perennial grass with disjunct distribution between subtropical regions of North and South America, testing the hypothesis that the species has a similar realized climatic niche in both subcontinents. The climatic niche of T. crinita in North and South America was characterized and compared using presence records and five uncorrelated bioclimatic variables selected according to their ecological importance for the species. We used reciprocal modeling to make geographic projections of the realized niche within each subcontinent. Niche overlap between T. crinita distributions in North and South America was intermediate for the individual climatic variables and the multivariate space. In all cases the test of equivalence between climates inhabited by T. crinita indicated that the realized niche of the species differ significantly between subcontinents. Also, the similarity test showed that in the majority of cases the realized niche in both subcontinents was significantly different than that expected by chance. T. crinita occupied a greater diversity of environments in South than in North America, while in the latter its distribution was displaced to drier and warmer environments. The modeled geographic distribution using the actual occurrences of the species in North America did not accurately predict the distribution in South America, and vice versa. Together, these results led us to reject the hypothesis of similar niche of T. crinita in both subcontinents. This information may be useful to manage restoration efforts by presenting the suitable areas and climates for the species, and suggesting that translocation of individuals between subcontinents could only be recommended with caution because introduced genotypes can be potentially maladaptive, and could colonize sites actually not occupied by the species within each subcontinent."
29953505," Peptides that exhibit enzymatic or hormonal activities are regulatory factors and desirable therapeutic drugs because of their high target specificity and minimal side effects. Unfortunately, these drugs are susceptible to enzymatic degradation, leading to their rapid elimination and thereby demanding frequent dosage. Structurally modified forms of some peptide drugs have shown enhanced pharmacokinetics, improving their oral bioavailability. Here, we discuss a novel glycomimetic approach to modify lysine residues in peptides. In a model system, the ε-amine of Ts-Lys-OMe was reductively alkylated with a glucose derivative to afford a dihydroxylated piperidine in place of the amine. A similar modification was applied to H-KPV-NH2, a tripeptide derived from the α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) reported to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Antimicrobial assays, under a variety of conditions, showed no activity for Ac-KPV-NH2 or the α- or ε-glycoalkylated analogs. Glycoalkylated peptides did, however, show stability toward proteolytic enzymes."
29953504," Neutrophil functions have long been regarded as limited to acute inflammation and the defense against microbes. The role(s) of neutrophils in cancer remain poorly understood. Neutrophils infiltrate tumors and are key effector cells in the orchestration of inflammatory responses. Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most recurrent endocrine malignant tumor and is responsible for 70% of deaths due to endocrine cancers. No studies are so far available on the role of neutrophils in TC. Our purpose was to study the involvement of tumor-associated neutrophils in TC. Highly purified human neutrophils (>99%) from healthy donors were stimulated in vitro with conditioned media derived from TC cell lines TPC1 and 8505c (TC-CMs). Neutrophil functions (e.g., chemotaxis, activation, plasticity, survival, gene expression, and protein release) were evaluated. TC-derived soluble factors promoted neutrophil chemotaxis and survival. Neutrophil chemotaxis toward a TC-CM was mediated, at least in part, by CXCL8/IL-8, and survival was mediated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In addition, each TC-CM induced morphological changes and activation of neutrophils (e.g., CD11b and CD66b upregulation and CD62L shedding) and modified neutrophils' kinetic properties. Furthermore, each TC-CM induced production of reactive oxygen species, expression of proinflammatory and angiogenic mediators (CXCL8/IL-8, VEGF-A, and TNF-α), and a release of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). Moreover, in TC patients, tumor-associated neutrophils correlated with larger tumor size. TC cell lines produce soluble factors able to ""educate"" neutrophils toward an activated functional state. These data will advance the understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of innate immunity in TC."
29953503," Although distinct amino acid motifs containing consecutive prolines (polyP) cause ribosome stalling, which necessitates recruitment of the translation elongation factor P (EF-P), they occur strikingly often in bacterial proteomes. For example, polyP motifs are found in more than half of all histidine kinases in Escherichia coli K-12, which raises the question of their role(s) in receptor function. Here we have investigated the roles of two polyP motifs in the osmosensor and histidine kinase EnvZ. We show that the IPPPL motif in the HAMP domain is required for dimerization of EnvZ. Moreover, replacement of the prolines in this motif by alanines disables the receptor's sensor function. The second motif, VVPPA, which is located in the periplasmic domain, was found to be required for interaction with the modulator protein MzrA. Our study also reveals that polyP-dependent stalling has little effect on EnvZ levels. Hence, both polyP motifs in EnvZ are primarily involved in protein-protein interaction. Furthermore, while the first motif occurs in almost all EnvZ homologues, the second motif is only found in species that have MzrA, indicating co-evolution of the two proteins."
29953502," This study evaluated the morphological change in aqueous humor outflow (AHO) pathways using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) volumetric scans in glaucoma patients before and after glaucoma surgery. In this prospective observational case series, 15 eyes (13 patients) with glaucoma were treated with 120-degree Trabectome or 360-degree suture trabeculotomy and followed up for 3 months. B-scan images of the posttrabecular AHO pathway were reconstructed and the pathway areas were evaluated, before and after surgery. Changes in posttrabecular AHO pathway were qualitatively classified as ""increased"", ""non-significant change"", and ""decreased"" on reconstructed B-scan images. Quantitative measurements of the posttrabecular AHO pathway areas were performed pre- and postoperatively. Factors associated with both qualitative and quantitative changes in AHO pathway were investigated. From 30 regions (15 nasal and 15 temporal regions) in the 15 eyes, AHO pathways were analyzable in 20 regions pre- and postoperatively. Qualitative assessments of the pathway changes were ""increased"" in 8 regions, ""non-significant change"" in 9 regions, and ""decreased"" in 3 regions. Quantitative assessments of the average pathway area did not change significantly (from 3155±1633 pixels preoperatively to 3212±1684 pixels postoperatively, P = 0.50). All parameters relating to intraocular pressure changes or the surgical location were not associated with postoperative AHO pathway change. The intrascleral AHO pathway could be well visualized in glaucoma patients pre- and postoperatively using swept-source optical coherence tomography. However, structural changes in the AHO pathway assessed by SS-OCT were not significant after trabecular-targeted glaucoma surgery. Functional assessments of AHO are needed in future studies."
29953501," Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) are cognitively complex activities related to independent living in the community. Robust IADL scales are needed, however the psychometric properties of instruments have been little evaluated. There is no validated instrument for Sri Lankan older populations. Sri Lanka has the highest proportion of older people in South Asia with rapid population ageing. Therefore, it is essential to have standard instruments to assess activity limitations. We aimed to cross-culturally adapt the original Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale from English to Sinhala and evaluate the psychometric properties of the Sinhala version. Cross-cultural adaptation of the instrument was performed. The instrument was validated in a sample of 702 community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years and above in Sri Lanka. Reliability (internal consistency and inter-rater reliability) was assessed. Construct validity of the scale was evaluated by performing exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and testing convergent and divergent validity. The Lawton IADL scale was successfully adapted to Sri Lankan context. Internal consistency of the scale was very high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.91). Very good inter-rater reliability was observed with very good agreement for all items. Inter-class correlations for overall IADL score ranged from 0.57 to 0.91. Results of the exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported the unidimensionality of the scale. Goodness of fit indices in confirmatory factor analysis were in acceptable range (CFI = 0.98, SRMR = 0.06, NNFI = 0.97). Strength of associations were significant and in the expected direction. Results of the known group validity were also significant, confirming the convergent and divergent validity. The Lawton IADL scale was successfully translated and culturally adapted to Sinhala language. The Sinhala version demonstrated excellent reliability and construct validity. Given good psychometric properties, this scale would be recommended for use in future research."
29953500," MicroRNA-210 (miR-210) is a robust target for hypoxia-inducible factor, and its overexpression has been detected in a variety of solid tumors. However, the role of miR-210 in the development, progression and response to therapy in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) remains undefined. We report here that high miR-210 expression was significantly correlated with the shorter survival of CCA patients. Overexpression of miR-210 inhibited CCA cell proliferation at the G2/M phase and reduced the gemcitabine sensitivity in CCA cells under CoCl2-induced pseudohypoxia. Concomitantly, inhibition of endogenous miR-210 activity using miRNA sponges increased cell proliferation under CoCl2-induced pseudohypoxia, resulting in an increase in gemcitabine sensitivity in CCA cells. We showed that HIF-3α, a negative controller of HIF-1α, was a target of miR-210 constituting a feed-forward hypoxic regulatory loop. Our data suggest an important role of miR-210 in sustaining HIF-1α activity via the suppression of HIF-3α, regulating cell growth and chemotherapeutic drug resistance in CCA."
29953499," MALT1 controls several receptors-mediated signaling to nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) through both its scaffold and protease function. MALT1 protease activity is shown to inactivate several negative regulators of NF-κB signaling and augment NF-κB activation ability. In this study, MALT1 was demonstrated to autoprocess itself in the presence of oligomerization-competent BCL10. Cleavage occurred after Arginine 781 located in the C-terminus of MALT1. Shortened MALT1 cleavage products showed attenuated binding ability with TRAF6. Its NF-κB activation ability was also weakened. Various MALT1 constructs including wild type, catalytically-inactive (MALT1_C464A), cleavage-defective (MALT1_R781L), or truncated (MALT1_1-781) form of MALT1 was introduced into MALT1-knocked-down-Jurkat T cells. Cleavage-defective MALT1_R781L retained its proteolytic and initial IκBα phosphorylation activity as MALT1. Truncated MALT1_1-781 mutant showed weakness in IκBα phosphorylation and the expression of NF-κB targets IL-2 and IFN-γ. Cleavage at R781 was detectable but marginal after activation with TPA/ionomycin or anti-CD3 antibody in lymphocytes. However, cleavage at R781 was evident in ABC-DLBCL cells such as OCI-Ly3, HBL-1. HBL-1 cells with induced expression of catalytically-inactive MALT1_C464A or cleavage-defective MALT1_R781L exhibited characteristic of retarded-growth. These findings suggested that cleavage at R781 of MALT1 played a role in the survival of ABC-DLBCL cells."
29953498," Drought is the most important constraint that effects chickpea production globally. RNA-Seq has great potential to dissect the molecular mechanisms of tolerance to environmental stresses. Transcriptome profiles in roots and shoots of two contrasting Iranian kabuli chickpea genotypes (Bivanij and Hashem) were investigated under water-limited conditions at early flowering stage using RNA-Seq approach. A total of 4,572 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Of these, 261 and 169 drought stress responsive genes were identified in the shoots and the roots, respectively, and 17 genes were common in the shoots and the roots. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed several sub-categories related to the stress, including response to stress, defense response and response to stimulus in the tolerant genotype Bivanij as compared to the sensitive genotype Hashem under drought stress. In addition, several Transcription factors (TFs) were identified in major metabolic pathways such as, ABA, proline and flavonoid biosynthesis. Furthermore, a number of the DEGs were observed in ""QTL-hotspot"" regions which were reported earlier in chickpea. Drought tolerance dissection in the genotypes revealed that the genes and the pathways involved in shoots of Bivanij were the most important factor to make a difference between the genotypes for drought tolerance. The identified TFs in the experiment, particularly those which were up-regulated in shoots of Bivanij during drought stress, were potential candidates for enhancing tolerance to drought."
29953497," Forensic odontology (FO) is regarded in the literature as one of the most reliable and economical scientific methods for victim identification in mass disasters (MDs). The present paper systematically reviews the role of forensic odontologists in various global MDs. A comprehensive search of the literature databases (PubMed, Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar), along with cross-referencing published peer-reviewed articles, was conducted. The search included full texts, abstracts or titles, had no inclusion year limit (searched until September 2017) and was limited to the English language. Keywords included a combination of 'Forensic odontology', 'Dental records', 'Victim identification', 'Natural mass disaster', 'Criminal mass disaster', 'Accidental mass disaster' and 'Victim disaster'. Of the included disasters (20), 12 (57.14%) were accidental, 5 (23.80%) natural and 3 (19.04%) were criminal. The maximum number of victims was associated with the Japan tsunami (15892), followed by the Thailand tsunami (4280) and the Estonia ferry disaster (852). A total of 23654 victims were reported, of which 20569 (86.96%) were positively identified. Reports from 17 MDs included the use of FO in victim identification [3025 (14.70%) cases]. In addition, 1094 victims (5.31%; from 7 papers) were identified using FO in combination with other methodologies. The highest percentage of victims was identified using FO following the Kentucky air crash (47; 100%), followed by the Newark air crash (38; 76%), the Nepal air crash (10; 71.42%), the France air crash (56; 65.88%), the Australian bushfire (14; 63.63%), and the Estonia ferry disaster (57; 60.63%). FO has played a significant role in victim identification in several MDs around the world. The success of FO-based identification is heavily dependent on the availability of ante-mortem records from general dental practitioners. Hence, adequate knowledge about FO and appropriate dental record keeping among general dental practitioners are critical."
29953496," High levels of sedentary behaviours have been independently associated with several negative health indicators, including obesity. Screen time (ST) is often used as a contributing measure of sedentary time. It is recommended that children spend no more than 2 hours on recreational sedentary screen-based activities daily. We describe screen-based sedentary time of urban school children and examine the associations between body mass index (BMI) and percent Body Fat (%BF) with ST levels. Data were collected from 563 children aged 9 to 11 years attending 29 non-boarding primary schools in Nairobi, Kenya, as part of the International Study of Childhood Obesity, Lifestyle and the Environment (ISCOLE). Data were analysed to test for associations between ST and sex, type of school attended (public verses private), Socioeconomic status, adiposity, and access to electronic devices. We also assessed participants' ST on school and weekend days. Of the participants recruited, 15.5% had high ST levels, 67.9% spent no more than 2 hours in recreational screen activities on school days while 74.2% did not meet the guidelines on weekend days. Participants sex was associated with daily ST (t = 3.5, p<0.001), ST on the weekend (t = 3.9, p <0.001) and total ST per week (t = 3.5, p<0.001) with males having higher ST than females. ST was associated with type of school for daily ST (t = 3.6, p <0.001), ST on the weekend (t = 4.5, p<0.001) and total ST per week (t = 3.6, p<0.001) where private schools pupils had higher ST. ST was not associated with BMI. ST was not associated with %BF except on weekend days (p = 0.038) where those classified as overfat/obese (fat) had higher ST. A large proportion of children spend more time than recommended on screen activities particularly on weekend days. Strategies to improve healthy living should focus on the reduction of sedentary ST for school-aged children."
29953495," Poverty and human capital development are inextricably linked and therefore research on human capital typically incorporates measures of economic well-being. In the context of randomized trials of health interventions, for example, such measures are used to: 1) assess baseline balance; 2) estimate covariate-adjusted analyses; and 3) conduct subgroup analyses. Many factors characterize economic well-being, however, and analysts often generate summary measures such as indices of household socio-economic status or wealth. In this paper, a household wealth index is developed and tested for participants in the cluster-randomized Sanitation, Hygiene, Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE) trial in rural Zimbabwe. Building on the approach used in the Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS), we combined a set of housing characteristics, ownership of assets and agricultural resources into a wealth index using principal component analysis (PCA) on binary variables. The index was assessed for internal and external validity. Its sensitivity was examined considering an expanded set of variables and an alternative statistical approach of polychoric PCA. Correlation between indices was determined using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and agreement between quintiles using a linear weighted Kappa statistic. Using the 2015 ZDHS data, we constructed a separate index and applied the loadings resulting from that analysis to the SHINE study population, to compare the wealth distribution in the SHINE study with rural Zimbabwe. The derived indices using the different methods were highly correlated (r>0.9), and the wealth quintiles derived from the different indices had substantial to near perfect agreement (linear weighted Kappa>0.7). The indices were strongly associated with a range of assets and other wealth measures, indicating both internal and external validity. Households in SHINE were modestly wealthier than the overall population of households in rural Zimbabwe. The SHINE wealth index developed here is a valid and robust measure of wealth in the sample."
29953494," Immune activating cytokines Interferon (IFN)-γ and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α are known to activate macrophages for killing of Leishmania parasite. IFN-γ provides therapeutic potential while TNF-α has been recognized to mediate protection in visceral model of infection. In the present study we investigated whether combination of IFN-γ and TNF-α has better therapeutic strength than individually using one of these cytokines in Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) patients. We performed combined blockade of IFN-γ and TNF-α in VL splenic biopsies and demonstrated it's impact on number of viable amastigotes and cytokine production. Additionally, selective depletion of splenic cell subsets was performed to establish the cellular sources of IFN-γ and TNF-α. Treatment of splenic aspirate cells with combination of anti-IFN-γ and anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibodies for 72 hours enabled no direct additive impact of these cytokines on parasite replication and IL-10 secretion, but IL-4 production was induced. Further assessment of splenic biopsies put forward CD4+ T cells as a source of IFN-γ whereas CD14+ cells contribute towards TNF-α production. Overall our results suggest, the interplay of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ derived from CD4+T lymphocytes and TNF-α from CD14+ cells has no direct additive impact on parasite replication but induces IL-4 production. Our data does not support direct targeting of IFN-γ and TNF-α for combination therapy but targeting these cytokines as an adjuvant in patients with exaggerated tissue inflammatory responses can have favourable patient outcome."
29953493," Dengue fever is a major international public health concern, with more than 55% of the world population at risk of infection. Recent climate changes related to global warming have increased the potential risk of domestic outbreaks of dengue in Korea. In this study, we develop a two-strain dengue model associated with climate-dependent parameters based on Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration. We assess the potential risks of dengue outbreaks by means of the vector capacity and intensity under various RCP scenarios. A sensitivity analysis of the temperature-dependent parameters is performed to explore the effects of climate change on dengue transmission dynamics. Our results demonstrate that a higher temperature significantly enhances the potential threat of domestic dengue outbreaks in Korea. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of countermeasures on the cumulative incidence of humans and vectors. The current main control measures (comprising only travel restrictions) for infected humans in Korea are not as effective as combined control measures (travel restrictions and vector control), dramatically reducing the possibilities of dengue outbreaks."
29953492," Small integral membrane protein of the lysosome/late endosome (SIMPLE) is a 161-amino acid cellular protein that contains a characteristic C-terminal domain known as the SIMPLE-like domain (SLD), which is well conserved among species. Several studies have demonstrated that SIMPLE localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), early endosomes, lysosomes, multivesicular bodies, aggresomes and the plasma membrane. However, the amino acid regions responsible for its subcellular localization have not yet been identified. The SLD resembles the FYVE domain, which binds phosphatidylinositol (3)-phosphate (PI3P) and determines the subcellular localization of FYVE domain-containing proteins. In the present study, we have found that SIMPLE binds specifically to PI4P through its SLD. SIMPLE co-localized with PI4P and Rab11, a marker for recycling endosomes (REs, organelles enriched in PI4P) in both the IMS32 mouse Schwann cell line and Hela cells. Sucrose density-gradient centrifugation revealed that SIMPLE co-fractionated with syntaxin-6 (a TGN marker) and Rab11. We have also found that SIMPLE knockdown impeded recycling of transferrin and of transferrin receptor. Our overall results indicate that SIMPLE may regulate protein trafficking physiologically by localizing to the TGN and/or REs by binding PI4P."
29953491," Although Sensititre Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MYCOTB) plate offers both drug susceptibility testing (DST) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results, it has not been evaluated against both Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) and Middlebrook 7H10 (MB7H10) DST methods at standard critical concentrations. We analyzed 76 M. tuberculosis isolates consisting of 54 isolates from the Uganda National TB drug resistance survey done December 2009-February 2011 and 22 isolates from the World Health Organization External Quality Assessment panel for the year 2011. All isolates were tested for LJ, MB7H10 and MYCOTB plate based DSTs for streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol anti-tuberculosis drugs. The agreement of MB7H10 with LJ and accuracy of MYCOTB plate using either LJ-DST or MB7H10 as a reference standard were determined. The agreement (kappa) of MB7H10 with LJ was; 0.687 for rifampicin, 0.498 for isoniazid, 0.275 for streptomycin and 0.082 for ethambutol which as almost similar when compared with MYCOTB plate. The sensitivity (95% confidence interval; CI) of MYCOTB plate when LJ was used as a reference standard was higher for streptomycin 87.5% (81.6-98.4) followed by isoniazid 75.9% (65.1-95.6) and rifampicin 73.1% (52.2-88.4). When MB7H10 was used as reference standard, the sensitivity of MYCOTB plate improved significantly; isoniazid 96.2% (80.3-99.9), rifampicin 94.0 (83.4-98.7) and 93.8% (69.7-99.8). There was good agreement between MYCOTB plate and MB7H10; 1.00 for ethambutol, 0.959 for streptomycin, 0.915 for rifampicin and 0.778 for isoniazid. The performance of the two culture-based reference standards for phenotypic first-line drug susceptibility testing methods, LJ and MB7H10, varied much even with acceptable MYCOTB plate MICs. There was acceptable agreement and accuracy of MYCOTB plate for drug susceptibility testing when MB7H10 was used as reference standard than with LJ-DST. Results from MIC information makes the MYCOTB plate more suitable for guiding clinicians on the choice of the most appropriate TB treatment regimen as well as limits of detection for TB drug resistance."
29953490," Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is the most common cause of non-glaucomatous optic neuropathy in older adults. Optical coherence tomographic angiography (OCT-A) is an emerging, non-invasive method to study the microvasculature of the posterior pole, including the optic nerve head. The goal of this study was to assess the vascular changes in the optic nerve head and peripapillary area associated with NAION using OCT-A. Retrospective comparative case series. We performed OCT-A in 25 eyes (7 acute and 18 non-acute) in 19 patients with NAION. Fellow, unaffected eyes were analyzed for comparison. Patent macro- and microvascular densities were quantified in the papillary and peripapillary regions of unaffected, acutely affected, and non-acutely affected eyes and compared across these groups according to laminar segment and capillary sampling region, and with respect to performance on automated visual field testing. In acutely affected eyes, OCT-A revealed a reduction in the signal from the major retinal vessels and dilation of patent superficial capillaries in the peripapillary area. By contrast, non-acutely affected eyes showed attenuation of patent capillaries. The peripapillary choriocapillaris was obscured by edema in acute cases, but was similar between non-acute and unaffected eyes. The degree of dilation of the superficial microvasculature in the acute phase and attenuation in the non-acute phase each correlated inversely with visual field performance. The region of reduced patent capillary density correlated with the location of visual field defects in 80% of acute cases and 80% of non-acute cases. OCT-A reveals a dynamic shift in the superficial capillary network of the optic nerve head with strong functional correlates in both the acute and non-acute phases of NAION. Further study may validate OCT-A as a useful adjunctive diagnostic tool in the evaluation of ischemic optic neuropathy."

29953488," Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) is a copper-dependent monoamine oxidase that contributes to the remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by cross linkage of collagen and elastin fibres and has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in cancer and fibrosis. In the skin, LOXL2 is essential for epidermal cell polarity and differentiation. However, its role in the dermis has not been evaluated. We found that Loxl2 is dispensable for mouse dermal development, maturation and homeostasis, yet affects dermal stiffness. Neither loss of Loxl2 nor increased Loxl2 expression affected dermal architecture following treatment with the phorbol ester TPA. Furthermore, Loxl2 expression did not alter the stroma of DMBA-TPA-induced tumours. We conclude that, although Loxl2 is expressed in both dermis and epidermis, its function appears largely confined to the epidermis."
29953487," FAcilitates Chromatin Transcription (FACT) is a complex of SSRP1 and SPT16 that is involved in chromatin remodeling during transcription, replication, and DNA repair. FACT has been mostly studied in cell-free or single cell model systems because general FACT knockout (KO) is embryonically lethal (E3.5). FACT levels are limited to the early stages of development and stem cell niches of adult tissues. FACT is upregulated in poorly differentiated aggressive tumors. Importantly, FACT inhibition (RNAi) is lethal for tumors but not normal cells, making FACT a lucrative target for anticancer therapy. To develop a better understanding of FACT function in the context of the mammalian organism under normal physiological conditions and in disease, we aimed to generate a conditional FACT KO mouse model. Because SPT16 stability is dependent on the SSRP1-SPT16 association and the presence of SSRP1 mRNA, we targeted the Ssrp1 gene using a CreERT2- LoxP approach to generate the FACT KO model. Here, we highlight the limitations of the CreERT2-LoxP (Rosa26) system that we encountered during the generation of this model. In vitro studies showed an inefficient excision rate of ectopically expressed CreERT2 (retroviral CreERT2) in fibroblasts with homozygous floxed Ssrp1. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that the excision efficiency could only be increased with germline expression of two alleles of Rosa26CreERT2. The expression of one germline Rosa26CreERT2 allele led to the incomplete excision of Ssrp1. The limited efficiency of the CreERT2-LoxP system may be sufficient for studies involving the deletion of genes that interfere with cell growth or viability due to the positive selection of the phenotype. However, it may not be sufficient for studies that involve the deletion of genes supporting growth, or those crucial for development. Although CreERT2-LoxP is broadly used, it has limitations that have not been widely discussed. This paper aims to encourage such discussions."
29953486," Enterococci represent one of the microbial world's most challenging enigmas. Colonization of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of high-risk/immunocompromised patients by enterococci exhibiting resistance to vancomycin (VRE) can lead to life-threating infections, including bloodstream infections and endocarditis. Decolonization of VRE from the GIT of high-risk patients represents an alternative method to suppress the risk of the infection. It could be considered as a preventative measure to protect against VRE infections in high-risk individuals. Though multiple agents (ramoplanin and bacitracin) have been evaluated clinically, no drugs are currently approved for use in VRE decolonization of the GIT. The present study evaluates ebselen, a clinical molecule, for use as a decolonizing agent against VRE. When evaluated against a broad array of enterococcal isolates in vitro, ebselen was found to be as potent as linezolid (minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% of clinical isolates tested was 2 μg/ml). Though VRE has a remarkable ability to develop resistance to antibacterial agents, no resistance to ebselen emerged after a clinical isolate of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was serially-passaged with ebselen for 14 days. Against VRE biofilm, a virulence factor that enables the bacteria to colonize the gut, ebselen demonstrated the ability to both inhibit biofilm formation and disrupt mature biofilm. Furthermore, in a murine VRE colonization reduction model, ebselen proved as effective as ramoplanin in reducing the bacterial shedding and burden of VRE present in the fecal content (by > 99.99%), cecum, and ileum of mice. Based on the promising results obtained, ebselen warrants further investigation as a novel decolonizing agent to quell VRE infection."
29953485," Although hemodynamic influence of the subprosthetic tissue, termed as pannus, may contribute to prosthetic aortic valve dysfunction, the relationship between pannus extent and hemodynamics in the prosthetic valve has rarely been reported. We investigated the fluid dynamics of pannus formation using in vitro experiments with particle image velocimetry. Subvalvular pannus formation caused substantial changes in prosthetic valve transvalvular peak velocity, transvalvular pressure gradient (TPG) and opening angle. Maximum flow velocity and corresponding TPG were mostly affected by pannus width. When the pannus width was 25% of the valve diameter, pannus formation elevated TPG to >2.5 times higher than that without pannus formation. Opening dysfunction was observed only for a pannus involvement angle of 360°. Although circumferential pannus with an involvement angle of 360° decreased the opening angle of the valve from approximately 82° to 58°, eccentric pannus with an involvement angle of 180° did not induce valve opening dysfunction. The pannus involvement angle largely influenced the velocity flow field at the aortic sinus and corresponding hemodynamic indices, including wall shear stress, principal shear stress and viscous energy loss distributions. Substantial discrepancy between the velocity-based TPG estimation and direct pressure measurements was observed for prosthetic valve flow with pannus formation."
29953484," Otitis media (OM) is a major reason for children's visits to physicians and a major cause of their being treated with antibiotics. It not only causes economic burdens but also influences hearing, speech, and education. To our knowledge, no nationwide population-based study has assessed the association between air pollution and OM. Therefore, this study evaluated the association between air pollution levels and the incidence of OM. We identified cases of OM that occurred in South Korea between January 2011 and December 2012 from the Korea National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort database, and evaluated its relationship with five air pollutants: particulate matter (PM10, particulates ≤10 μm in diameter), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. Associations between the weekly incidence of OM and the five air pollutants were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and their 99.9% Bonferroni-corrected confidence intervals after adjusting for gender, age, season, and region. We based our analysis on 160,875 hospital visits for OM by children aged <15 years. Correlations with higher concentrations of the five pollutants showed higher ORs than did the reference values at most time lags. PM10 had the largest influence on the OM incidence at a time lag of 0 weeks, whereas NO2 and O3 had the largest impacts on OM incidence at time lags of 1 and 4 weeks, respectively. These findings support the notion that the incidence of OM is associated with ambient air pollution."
29953483," Although prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) reduces offspring growth, it may increase obesity risk at adolescence. Animal models of PAE display glucose intolerance and increased adiposity, suggesting that PAE causes metabolic reprogramming. We tested this hypothesis in a mouse model of binge PAE, wherein pregnant C57Bl/6J females received 3 g/kg alcohol (ETOH) daily from gestational day 12.5 to 17.5; maltodextrin (MD) and medium chain triglycerides (MCT) served as isocaloric nutritional controls, and sham (H2O) treatment controlled for gavage stress. Our comprehensive assessment quantified body composition, energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, and cardiovascular function in offspring at age 17 weeks. Although ETOH pups were initially lighter than all other groups, they did not have a unique obesogenic phenotype. Instead, a similar obesogenic phenotype emerged in all three caloric groups (MCT, MD, ETOH), such that caloric groups had greater post-weaning weight gain (both sexes), reduced gonadal fat weight (males), and reduced glucose clearance (males) compared against H2O offspring. PAE did not affect body composition, respiratory exchange ratio, metabolic adaption to high-fat or low-fat diet, eating behavior, and blood pressure, and ETOH values did not differ from those obtained from isocaloric controls. Exposure to a higher alcohol dose (4.5 g/kg) or a high-fat (60%) diet did not exacerbate differences in body composition or glucose tolerance. ""PAE-specific"" effects on postnatal growth, glucose tolerance, adiposity, or hypertension only emerged when PAE offspring were compared just against H2O controls, or against MD controls. We conclude that prior reports of obesity and glucose intolerance in adult PAE offspring reflect the contribution of added gestational calories, and not alcohol's pharmacologic action. Results suggest that the increased adiposity risk in FASD is not caused by metabolic reprogramming, and instead originates from behavioral, medication, and/or dietary practices. This study highlights the importance of appropriate dietary controls in nutritional studies of PAE."
29953482," Skeletal muscle fatigue has been shown to be associated with hyperphosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor 1 at serine 2843 (pRyR1Ser2843), due to chronic overloading exercise. We investigated whether pRyR1Ser2843, is a mechanism relevant for muscle fatigue also under acute, in contrast to chronic, muscle loading. 24 male subjects (age: 24,8±3,8; height: 182,8±7,2 cm; weight: 82,5±9,9 kg) were evenly (n = 6) assigned to the following four different resistance exercise (RE) groups: hypertrophy- (HYP), strength endurance- (SE), maximum power- (MAX) at the subjects' 10, 25 and 3 repetition maximum, respectively, and low intensity (LI) RE with 70% of the 10 repetition maximum. Each group completed three different RE volumes (1 set, 5, and 10 sets). Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis were taken before and after exercise, analyzed for pRyR1Ser2843 and examined for association with RE-induced muscle fatigue which was determined as reduction in maximum isometric force (isoFmax) in the quadriceps femoris muscle also before and after exercise.The degree of RE-induced muscle fatigue was specific in terms of set volume as well as of RE mode. isoFmax was not reduced in any group after one set of RE. Five sets led to a significant reduction of isoFmax in HYP and SE but not in LI and MAX (p<0,05). Ten sets of RE, as compared to five sets, exclusively induced further muscle fatigue in LI. In terms of RE mode differences, isoFmax reduction was generally higher in HYP and SE than in MAX and Li after five and ten sets of RE (p<0,05). However, pRyR1Ser2843 did not show any significant regulation, regardless of exercise condition. We conclude that despite its relevance in reducing muscle contractility in chronic overloading, pRyR1Ser2843 does not reflect the degree of muscle fatigue exerted by acute hypertrophy-, strength endurance-, maximum power and low intensity-oriented exercise."
29953481," Analyzing geological drilling hole images acquired by Axial View Panoramic Borehole Televiewer (APBT) is a key step to explore the geological structure in a geological exploration. Conventionally, the borehole images are examined by technicians, which is inefficient and subjective. In this paper, three dominant types of borehole-wall images on coal-rock mass structure, namely, border images, fracture images and intact rock mass images are mainly studied. The traditional image classification methods based on unified feature extraction algorithm and single classifier is not effect for the borehole images. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel two-stage classification approach to improve the classification performance of borehole images. In the first-stage classification, the border images are identified from three kinds of images based on texture features and gray-scale histograms features. For the remaining two types of images, in the second-stage classification, Gabor filter is first applied to segment the region of interest (ROI) (such as microfracture, absciss layer and horizontal cracks, etc.) and the central interference region. Then, using the same feature vector after eliminating the central interference region, fracture images are separated from intact rock mass images. We test our two-stage classification system with real borehole images. The results of experimental show that the two-stage classification method can effectively classify three major borehole-wall images with the correction rate of 95.55% in the first stage and 95% in the second stage."
29953480," Pull-out force and insertion torque have not been generally used as intraoperative measures for the evaluation of pedicle screw stability because of their invasiveness. On the other hand, resonance frequency analysis is a non-invasive and repeatable technique that has been clinically used in dentistry to evaluate implant stability e.g. by the Osstell apparatus. In this study, the characteristics of the implant stability quotient (ISQ) value obtained by the Osstell apparatus in the field of spinal surgery were investigated. Biomechanical test materials simulating human bone were used to provide a comparative platform for evaluating each fixation strength measure, including pull-out force, insertion torque, and the ISQ value. To perform pull-out force measurement and to repeat pedicle screw insertion and removal, loosening was artificially created, and its effect was investigated. The grade of loosening was quantified on a micro-CT image after pedicle screw removal. In the comparison of the 3 fixation strength measures, the correlations of the ISQ value with the pull-out force (R2 = 0.339 p <0.0001) and the insertion torque (R2 = 0.337 p <0.0001) were lower than the correlation between pull-out force and insertion torque (R2 = 0.918 p <0.0001). On a micro-CT study, the material volume of the internal threads disappeared after destruction of its integrity due to repeated pedicle screw insertion and removal. Material integrity destruction of the internal threads decreased only the pull-out force and the insertion torque, but it did not affect the ISQ value. The ISQ value only decreased when the material volume of the internal threads disappeared, probably because the ISQ value reflects the resistance against a force in the perpendicular direction of the screw, unlike the conventional measures of fixation strength, such as pull-out force and insertion torque, which reflect axial load."
29953479," Metabolic energy expenditure during human gait is poorly understood. Mechanical energy loss during heel strike contributes to this energy expenditure. Previous work has estimated the energy absorption during heel strike as 0.8 J using an effective foot mass model. The aim of our study is to investigate the possibility of determining the energy absorption by more directly estimating the work done by the ground reaction force, the force-integral method. Concurrently another aim is to compare this method of direct determination of work to the method of an effective foot mass model. Participants of our experimental study were asked to walk barefoot at preferred speed. Ground reaction force and lower leg kinematics were collected at high sampling frequency (3000 Hz; 1295 Hz), with tight synchronization. The work done by the ground reaction force is 3.8 J, estimated by integrating this force over the foot-ankle deformation. The effective mass model is improved by dropping the assumption that foot-ankle deformation is maximal at the instant of the impact force peak. On theoretical grounds it is clear that in the presence of substantial damping that peak force and peak deformation do not occur simultaneously. The energy absorption results, due the vertical force only, corresponding to the force-integral method is similar to the results of the improved application of the effective mass model (2.7 J; 2.5 J). However the total work done by the ground reaction force calculated by the force-integral method is significantly higher than that of the vertical component alone. We conclude that direct estimation of the work done by the ground reaction force is possible and preferable over the use of the effective foot mass model. Assuming that energy absorbed is lost, the mechanical energy loss of heel strike is around 3.8 J for preferred walking speeds (≈ 1.3 m/s), which contributes to about 15-20% of the overall metabolic cost of transport."
29953478," Aim was to develop a full automatic clustering approach of the time-activity curves (TAC) from dynamic 18F-FET PET and evaluate its association with IDH1 mutation status and survival in patients with gliomas. Thirty-seven patients (mean age: 45±13 y) with newly diagnosed gliomas and dynamic 18F-FET PET before any histopathologic investigation or treatment were retrospectively included. Each dynamic 18F-FET PET was realigned to the first image and spatially normalized in the Montreal Neurological Institute template. A tumor mask was semi-automatically generated from Z-score maps. Each brain tumor voxel was clustered in one of the 3 following centroids using dynamic time warping and k-means clustering (centroid #1: slowly increasing slope; centroid #2: rapidly increasing followed by slowly decreasing slope; and centroid #3: rapidly increasing followed by rapidly decreasing slope). The percentage of each dynamic 18F-FET TAC within tumors and other conventional 18F-FET PET parameters (maximum and mean tumor-to-brain ratios [TBRmax and TBRmean], time-to-peak [TTP] and slope) was compared between wild-type and IDH1 mutant tumors. Their prognostic value was assessed in terms of progression free-survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Twenty patients were IDH1 wild-type and 17 IDH1 mutant. Higher percentage of centroid #1 and centroid #3 within tumors were positively (P = 0.016) and negatively (P = 0.01) correlated with IDH1 mutated status. Also, TBRmax, TBRmean, TTP, and slope discriminated significantly between tumors with and without IDH1 mutation (P range 0.01 to 0.04). Progression occurred in 22 patients (59%) at a median of 13.1 months (7.6-37.6 months) and 13 patients (35%) died from tumor progression. Patients with a percentage of centroid #1 > 90% had a longer survival compared with those with a percentage of centroid #1 < 90% (P = 0.003 for PFS and P = 0.028 for OS). This remained significant after stratification on IDH1 mutation status (P = 0.029 for PFS and P = 0.034 for OS). Compared to other conventional 18F-FET PET parameters, TTP and slope were associated with PFS and OS (P range 0.009 to 0.04). Based on dynamic 18F-FET PET acquisition, we developed a full automatic clustering approach of TAC which appears to be a valuable noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic marker in patients with gliomas."
29953477," Appropriate algorithms for the prediction of cardiovascular risk are strongly suggested in clinical practice, although still controversial. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the beneficial effect of phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 inhibitors is demonstrated on endothelial function but not on the estimation of cardiovascular risk. To study whether the chronic Vardenafil administration to men with T2DM influences variables correlated with the predicted long-term cardiovascular risk calculated by different validated algorithms. Per-protocol analysis of a longitudinal, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, investigator-started, clinical trial. 54 male patients affected by T2DM were assigned to study (26patients) and control-group (28patients), respectively. The study included a treatment phase (24weeks) (Vardenafil/placebo 10mg twice-daily) and a follow-up phase (24weeks). Three time points were considered: baseline(V0), end of treatment(V1) and end of the study(V2). Parameters evaluated: endothelial health-related parameters and cardiovascular risk, assessed by calculating the Framingham (coronary hart disease [CHD], myocardial infarction [MI], stroke and cardiovascular disease [CVD]), ASSIGN and CUORE equations. Predicted cardiovascular risk at ten years resulted different using the three algorithms chosen, without differences between study and control groups and among visits. IL-6 was directly related to CHD, CVD and CUORE scores at V1 and with MI and STROKE at V2. Similarly, hs-CRP was directly related to CHD, MI, STROKE and CUORE only at V1 in the study group. Testosterone serum levels were inversely related to CHD and MI at V1 in study group. The predicted cardiovascular risk is different depending on the algorithm chosen. Despite no predictive risk reduction after six months of treatment, a possible effect of Vardenafil could be hypothesized through its action on inflammation markers reduction and through restoration of normal testosterone levels."
29953476," There is no single standard chemotherapy regimen for elderly patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC). A phase III trial has confirmed that both capecitabine monotherapy and capecitabine plus oxaliplatin are well tolerated for elderly patients with AGC, but their economic influence in China is unknown. The purpose of this cost-effectiveness analysis was to estimate the effects of capecitabine monotherapy and capecitabine plus oxaliplatin in elderly patients with AGC on health and economic outcomes in China. We created a Markov model based on data from a Korean clinical phase III trial to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the treatment of elderly patients in the capecitabine monotherapy (X) group and capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) group. The costs were obtained from published reports and the local health system. The utilities were assumed on the basis of the published literature. Costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were estimated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (Monte Carlo simulations) were performed. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, X had a lower total cost ($45,731.68) and cost-effectiveness ratio ($65,918.93/QALY). The one-way sensitivity analysis suggested that the most influential parameter was the risk of requiring second-line chemotherapy in XELOX group. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis predicted that the X regimen was cost-effective 100% of the time, given a willingness-to-pay threshold of $26,598. Our findings show that the XELOX regimen is less cost-effective compared to the X regimen for elderly patients with AGC in China from a Chinese healthcare perspective."
29953475," Physical activity is an important component of type 2 diabetes management. Physical activity level among general population in Nepal is reported to vary considerably. However, knowledge on physical activity in Nepali diabetics is very limited. Engagement in physical activity could be influenced by perception of barriers against adopting the behavior and benefits of adopting it. This study explores the prevalence of physical activity and factors that promote and hinder the behavior among urban residing diabetic patients from Nepal. A descriptive cross-sectional design was adopted using a simple random sampling of type 2 diabetic patients from two diabetes clinics at Lalitpur and Kaski districts of Nepal. Two hundred and seventy participants were surveyed to obtain information on physical activity using Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. Metabolic equivalent values were calculated and categorized into high, moderate and low levels of physical activity. The information on perceived facilitators and barriers was collected by Exercise Barriers and Benefits Survey scale. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of the measures were estimated using multinomial logistic regression. The study showed relatively high prevalence of physical activity among the urban Nepali diabetic patients; 52% were moderately active and 28% highly active. Travel and work-related activities were the major contributors. Male participants, educated and those living in extended families were more motivated for physical activity than their counterparts. Physical fitness, strength and flexibility, better sleep at night, social interaction and longevity, were identified as the major facilitators. Family responsibilities, busy schedule and family discouragement were identified as barriers against being physically active. The diabetic patients were mostly moderately physically active. Future research could explore different context-specific ways of remaining physically active, apart from walking and doing household chores. More focus should also be placed on leisure time physical activity as it was found to be low. Interventions could be designed by promoting the facilitators and addressing the barriers of physical activity, which is likely to reduce the healthcare costs of management of diabetic complications."
29953474," Reverse genetics systems provide the opportunity to manipulate viral genomes and have been widely used to study RNA viruses and to develop new antiviral compounds and vaccine strategies. The recently described method called ISA (Infectious Subgenomic Amplicons) gives the possibility to rescue RNA viruses in days. We demonstrated in cell culture that the use of the ISA method led to a higher genetic diversity of viral populations than that observed using infectious clone technology. However, no replicative fitness difference was observed. In the present study, we used the chikungunya virus as a model to compare in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of viruses produced either from an infectious clone or using the ISA method. We confirmed the results found in cellulo corroborating that the use of the ISA method was associated with higher genetic diversity of viral populations in mosquitoes but did not affect the vector competence validating its use for in vivo experiments."
29953473," This study examined the prevalence, characteristic features, and complications associated with the occurrence of unerupted permanent incisors among children and adolescents attending a university dental teaching hospital. A retrospective review was performed of the clinical records of children and adolescents who attended the Prince Philip Dental Hospital, Hong Kong between 2005 and 2014. All patients who had at least one unerupted permanent incisor tooth were included. A total of 266 subjects with 320 unerupted permanent incisors were identified. The prevalence of unerupted permanent incisors among children and adolescents was 2.0%. Permanent maxillary central incisors (70.6%) were the most commonly affected teeth. The most common cause for unerupted incisors were dilacerations (n = 83, 36.7%) for maxillary central incisors; developmental dental anomalies (n = 22; 30.6%) together with unfavorable root development (n = 22; 30.6%) for maxillary laterals incisors; and abnormal tooth/tissue ratio (n = 11, 50.0%) for mandibular incisors. A majority of unerupted incisors presented with complications the most common being ectopic/displacement/rotation of the unerupted incisors (46.6%), loss of space (36.9%) and midline shift (27.5%). In conclusion, the causes were distinct for different manifestations of unerupted permanent incisors. As the majority of unerupted incisors presented with complications, a systematic and organized method of history taking as well as clinical and radiographic examinations is mandatory in the diagnosis of unerupted permanent incisors."
29953472," Retirement is a life transition involving an obligatory change in how people use their time. Because there are strong associations between use of time and health, different changes in time use following retirement may have different impacts on mental health. 105 participants were followed from 6 months before retirement to 12 months after retirement. At each time-point, use of time was quantified using a validated computerised 24-hour recall. Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS21), well-being with the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS), life satisfaction with the Australian Unity Personal Well-being Index (AUPWI), and self-esteem with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Time-use data were analysed using compositional data analysis, which treats the 24-h day as a holistic ""activity composition"" rather than as individual activity domains. Time flow analytics were used to map patterns of change in time use from pre-retirement to post-retirement. Regression analysis was used to determine whether changes in the activity composition were significantly associated with changes in mental health. Compositional isotemporal substitution models were used to illustrate dose-response relationships between changes in time use and conditional changes in mental health for individual activity domains, such as sleep, screen time and physical activity. Following retirement, time no longer spent in work flowed mainly to household chores, sleep, screen time and quiet time (e.g. reading). Mental health improved overall. Changes in the activity composition were significantly related to conditional changes in DASS21 total score, depression, stress, and self-esteem, but not to anxiety, well-being or life satisfaction. Replacing work time with physical activity or sleep was associated with positive changes in mental health. Effect sizes for 60-minute substitutions ranged from -0.15 to +0.31. Following retirement, replacing work with physical activity, and to a lesser extent sleep, is associated with better mental health."
29953471," Systematic reviews are increasingly using data from preclinical animal experiments in evidence networks. Further, there are ever-increasing efforts to automate aspects of the systematic review process. When assessing systematic bias and unit-of-analysis errors in preclinical experiments, it is critical to understand the study design elements employed by investigators. Such information can also inform prioritization of automation efforts that allow the identification of the most common issues. The aim of this study was to identify the design elements used by investigators in preclinical research in order to inform unique aspects of assessment of bias and error in preclinical research. Using 100 preclinical experiments each related to brain trauma and toxicology, we assessed design elements described by the investigators. We evaluated Methods and Materials sections of reports for descriptions of the following design elements: 1) use of comparison group, 2) unit of allocation of the interventions to study units, 3) arrangement of factors, 4) method of factor allocation to study units, 5) concealment of the factors during allocation and outcome assessment, 6) independence of study units, and 7) nature of factors. Many investigators reported using design elements that suggested the potential for unit-of-analysis errors, i.e., descriptions of repeated measurements of the outcome (94/200) and descriptions of potential for pseudo-replication (99/200). Use of complex factor arrangements was common, with 112 experiments using some form of factorial design (complete, incomplete or split-plot-like). In the toxicology dataset, 20 of the 100 experiments appeared to use a split-plot-like design, although no investigators used this term. The common use of repeated measures and factorial designs means understanding bias and error in preclinical experimental design might require greater expertise than simple parallel designs. Similarly, use of complex factor arrangements creates novel challenges for accurate automation of data extraction and bias and error assessment in preclinical experiments."
29953470," Knowledge of genetic combining ability and gene action would help breeders to choose suitable parents and devise an appropriate breeding strategy for coriander. In the present study, six diverse genotypes of coriander, their 15 F1s and 15 F2s were evaluated through randomized complete block design with three replications to study genetic combining ability for agronomic and phytochemical traits in coriander. Plants were subjected to well-watered (WW), mild water-deficit stress (MWDS) and severe water-deficit stress (SWDS) irrigation regimes. The results indicate that water-deficit stress decreased all of the measured traits in both the F1 and F2 generations. General combining ability and specific combining ability effects were highly significant for all of the traits in both the F1 and F2 generations. Additive gene action was predominant for phonology and fruit yield component traits in all irrigation regimes in both the F1 and F2 generations. For fatty acid content and total lipid yield, non-additive gene action was predominant in the F1 generation while additive gene action was predominant in the F2 generation under MWDS and SWDS conditions. The P4 parent had the highest general combining ability for fruit yield components in both the F1 and F2 generations. The P6 parent had the highest general combining ability for phenological and phytochemical traits. The P4 and P6 parents are promising material to develop early flowering and early maturing genotypes coupled with high total lipids in advanced generations of segregation."
29953469," We provide the first description of the skull, osteoderms, and hyoid apparatus of the poorly known alligator lizard Elgaria panamintina, and compare the cranial osteology of that species to the widespread and well-studied taxon Elgaria multicarinata. Patterns of morphological variation resulting from ontogenetic transformations and pathology are discussed. We employed x-ray computed tomography (CT) scans to examine two adult specimens of Elgaria panamintina and two adult specimens of Elgaria multicarinata, in addition to examining multiple traditionally prepared skeletal specimens of the latter species. CT scans provide simultaneous study of both articulated and disarticulated elements, allowing us to describe and document the morphology of the skull with exceptional precision and detail. The description of the skull of Elgaria panamintina serves as a generalization for all Elgaria; here we provide the first complete description of the skull of this genus for future uses in morphological and phylogenetic studies of both extant species and fossils."
29953468," Co-evolution between pairs of residues in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of homologous proteins has long been proposed as an indicator of structural contacts. Recently, several methods, such as direct-coupling analysis (DCA) and MetaPSICOV, have been shown to achieve impressive rates of contact prediction by taking advantage of considerable sequence data. In this paper, we show that prediction success rates are highly sensitive to the structural definition of a contact, with more permissive definitions (i.e., those classifying more pairs as true contacts) naturally leading to higher positive predictive rates, but at the expense of the amount of structural information contributed by each contact. Thus, the remaining limitations of contact prediction algorithms are most noticeable in conjunction with geometrically restrictive contacts-precisely those that contribute more information in structure prediction. We suggest that to improve prediction rates for such ""informative"" contacts one could combine co-evolution scores with additional indicators of contact likelihood. Specifically, we find that when a pair of co-varying positions in an MSA is occupied by residue pairs with favorable statistical contact energies, that pair is more likely to represent a true contact. We show that combining a contact potential metric with DCA or MetaPSICOV performs considerably better than DCA or MetaPSICOV alone, respectively. This is true regardless of contact definition, but especially true for stricter and more informative contact definitions. In summary, this work outlines some remaining challenges to be addressed in contact prediction and proposes and validates a promising direction towards improvement."
29953467," Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a kind of brain disease that arises due to the aggregation and fibrillation of amyloid β-peptides (Aβ). The peptide Aβ17-42 forms U-shape protofilaments of amyloid mature fibrils by cross-β strands, detected in brain cells of individuals with AD. Targeting the structure of Aβ17-42 and destabilizing its β-strands by natural compounds could be effective in the treatment of AD patients. Therefore, the interaction features of monomeric U-shape Aβ17-42 with natural flavonoids including myricetin, morin and flavone at different mole ratios were comprehensively studied to recognize the mechanism of Aβ monomer instability using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We found that all flavonoids have tendency to interact and destabilize Aβ peptide structure with mole ratio-dependent effects. The interaction free energies of myricetin (with 6 OHs) and morin (with 5 OHs) were more negative compared to flavone, although the total binding energies of all flavonoids are favorable and negative. Myricetin, morin and flavone penetrated into the core of the Aβ17-42 and formed self-clusters of Aβ17-42-flavonoid complexes. Analysis of Aβ17-42-flavonoids interactions identified that the hydrophobic interactions related to SASA-dependent energy are weak in all complexes. However, the intermolecular H-bonds are a main binding factor for shifting U-shape rod-like state of Aβ17-42 to globular-like disordered state. Myricetin and morin polyphenols form H-bonds with both peptide's carbonyl and amine groups whereas flavone makes H-bonds only with amine substitution. As a result, polyphenols are more efficient in destabilizing β-sheet structures of peptide. Accordingly, the natural polyphenolic flavonoids are useful in forming stable Aβ17-42-flavonoid clusters to inhibit Aβ17-42 aggregation and these compounds could be an effective candidate for therapeutically targeting U-shape protofilaments' monomer in amyloid mature fibrils."
29953466," Gray leaf spot is a maize foliar disease with worldwide distribution and can drastically reduce the production in susceptible genotypes. Published works indicate that resistance to gray leaf spot is a complex trait controlled by multiple genes, with additive effect and influenced by environment. The aim of this study was to identify genomic regions, including putative genes, associated with resistance to gray leaf spot under natural conditions of disease occurrence. A genome wide association study was conducted with 355,972 single nucleotide polymorphism markers on a phenotypic data composed by 157 tropical maize inbred lines, evaluated at Maringá -Brazil. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms were significantly associated with gray leaf spot, some of which were localized to previously reported quantitative trait loci regions. Three gene models linked to the associated single nucleotide polymorphism were expressed at flowering time and tissue related with gray leaf spot infection, explaining a considerable proportion of the phenotypic variance, ranging from 0.34 to 0.38. The gene model GRMZM2G073465 (bin 10.07) encodes a cysteine protease3 protein, gene model GRMZM2G007188 (bin 1.02) expresses a rybosylation factor-like protein and the gene model GRMZM2G476902 (bin 4.08) encodes an armadillo repeat protein. These three proteins are related with plant defense pathway. Once these genes are validated in next studies, they will be useful for marker-assisted selection and can help improve the understanding of maize resistance to gray leaf spot."
29953465," T-wave alternans (TWA), a marker of electrical instability, can be modulated by cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). The relationship between TWA and heart failure response to CRT has not been clearly defined. In 40-patients (age 65±11 years, left ventricular ejection-fraction [LVEF] 23±7%), TWA was evaluated prospectively at median of 2 months (baseline) and 8 months (follow-up) post-CRT implant. TWA-magnitude (Valt >0μV, k≥3), its duration (d), and burden (Valt ·d) were quantified in moving 128-beat segments during incremental atrial (AAI, native-TWA) and atrio-biventricular (DDD-CRT) pacing. The immediate and long-term effect of CRT on TWA was examined. Clinical response to CRT was defined as an increase in LVEF of ≥5%. Native-TWA was clinically significant (Valt ≥1.9μV, k≥3) in 68% of subjects at baseline. Compared to native-TWA at baseline, DDD-CRT pacing at baseline and follow-up reduced the number of positive TWA segments, peak-magnitude, longest-duration and peak-burden of TWA (44±5 to 33±5 to 28±4%, p = 0.02 and 0.002; 5.9±0.8 to 4.1±0.7 to 3.8±0.7μV, p = 0.01 and 0.01; 97±9 to 76±8 to 67±8sec, p = 0.004 and <0.001; and 334±65 to 178±58 to 146±54μV.sec, p = 0.01 and 0.004). In addition, the number of positive segments and longest-duration of native-TWA diminished during follow-up (44±5 to 35±6%, p = 0.044; and 97±9 to 81±9sec, p = 0.02). Clinical response to CRT was observed in 71% of patients; the reduction in DDD-CRT paced TWA both at baseline and follow-up was present only in responders (interaction p-values <0.1). Long-term CRT reduces the prevalence and magnitude of TWA. This CRT induced beneficial electrical remodeling is a marker of clinical response after CRT."
29953464," We assess the epidemiology and risk factors for mortality of bloodstream infection (BSI) in patients with acute leukemia (AL). Prospectively collected data of a cohort study from July 2004 to February 2016. Multivariate analyses were performed. 589 episodes of BSI were documented in 357 AL patients, 55% caused by gram-positive bacteria (coagulase-negative staphylococci 35.7%, Enterococcus spp 10.8%) and 43.5% by gram-negative bacteria (E. coli 21%, PA 12%). We identified 110 (18.7%) multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms, especially MDR-Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (7%). The 30-day mortality was 14.8%. Age (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.7-5.7); chronic lung disease (4.8; 1.1-21.8); fatal prognosis according to McCabe index (13.9; 6.4-30.3); shock (3.8; 1.9-7.7); pulmonary infection (3.6; 1.3-9.9); and MDR-PA infections with inappropriate treatment (12.8; 4.1-40.5) were related to mortality. MDR-PA BSI was associated to prior antipseudomonal cephalosporin use (9.31; 4.38-19.79); current use of betalactams (2.01; 1.01-4.3); shock (2.63; 1.03-6.7) and pulmonary source of infection (9.6; 3.4-27.21). MDR organisms were commonly isolated in BSI in AL. Inappropriate empiric antibiotic treatment for MDR-PA is the primary factor related to mortality that can be changed. New treatment strategies to improve the coverage of MDR-PA BSI should be considered in those patients with risk factors for this infection."
29953463," Triclosan and triclocarban (TCs) are broad-spectrum antimicrobials that, until recently, were found in a wide variety of household and personal wash products. Popular with consumers, TCs have not been shown to protect against infectious diseases. To determine whether use of TC-containing wash products reduces incidence of infection in children less than one year of age. Starting in 2011, we nested a randomized intervention of wash products with and without TCs within a multiethnic birth cohort. Maternal reports of infectious disease symptoms and antibiotic use were collected weekly by automated survey; household visits occurred every four months. Antibiotic prescriptions were identified by medical chart review. Urinary triclosan levels were measured in a participant subset. Differences by intervention group in reported infectious disease (primary outcome) and antibiotic use (secondary outcome) were assessed using mixed effects logistic regression and Fisher's Exact tests, respectively. Infectious illness occurred in 6% of weeks, with upper respiratory illness the predominant syndrome. Among 60 (45%) TC-exposed and 73 (55%) non-TC-exposed babies, infectious disease reports did not differ in frequency between groups (likelihood ratio test: p = 0.88). Medical visits with antibiotic prescriptions were less common in the TC group than in the non-TC group (7.8% vs. 16.6%, respectively; p = 0.02). Although randomization to TC-containing wash products was not associated with decreased infectious disease reports by mothers, TCs were associated with decreased antibiotic prescriptions, suggesting a benefit against bacterial infection. The recent removal of TCs from consumer wash products makes further elucidation of benefits and risks impracticable."
29953462," Soil tillage can affect the stability and formation of soil aggregates by disrupting soil structure. Frequent tillage deteriorates soil structure and weakens soil aggregates, causing them to be susceptible to decay. Different types of tillage systems affect soil physical properties and organic matter content, in turn influencing the formation of aggregates. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of long-term tillage on soil aggregates and aggregate-associated carbon in a black soil of Northeast China and to identify the optimal conservation tillage in this system. This research was conducted on a long-term tillage experimental field established in 1983 at the Jilin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Gongzhuling, China. Plots were treated with four tillage systems including no tillage (NT), spacing tillage (ST), moldboard plowing (MP), and conventional tillage (CT). We took samples every 10cm from 0-60cm depth and demonstrated that water-stable soil aggregates >0.25mm in diameter accounted for over 66.0% of total aggregates for all tillage treatments, and the percentage for the ST treatment was 34.5% higher than in the other treatments. The NT treatment had the highest effect at 0-10cm depth, while the effect for the ST treatment was highest at 0-30cm. SOC storage decreased with soil depth, with a significant accumulation at 0-20cm depth. Across treatments, aggregate-associated C at a depth of 0-10cm was higher in the NT and ST treatments than in the MP and CT treatments. The advantage of the NT treatment weakened with soil depth, while the amount of aggregate-associated C remained higher for the ST treatment. There were more macro-aggregates in the ST and NT treatments than in the MP and CT treatments, while the MP and CT treatments had more micro-aggregates. The sum of macro-aggregate contributing rates for soil organic C (SOC) was significantly superior to that of the micro-aggregates. Water-stable aggregates increased by 34.5% in the ST treatment, effectively improving the soil structure. Furthermore, 0.25-1.00 and 1-2mm aggregates had the highest SOC storage and responded rapidly to the various tillage treatments. Hence, they can serve as indicators for the long-term influence of different tillage treatments on the distribution of aggregates and SOC."
29953461," Several million gastropods are collected each year for the marine ornamental trade to graze on algae detrimental to aquarium species, however, little is known about popular species' suitability to perform this clean-up crew role. Three commonly traded gastropods, Turbo bruneus, Tectus fenestratus, and Tegula eiseni were assessed on their performance. Their survival was quantified as was their movement, and positioning with respect to water level and growth rates were calculated from the start and end weights. Nitrocellulose-coated slides were impregnated with an algal extract and the amount of grazing by each species was also compared. After 53 days final mortality levels of species were significantly different with all T. bruneus individuals surviving, whilst all T. fenestratus individuals apart from two and 35% of the T. eiseni had died by the end of the experiment. T. bruneus grazed significantly more than individuals of T. eiseni, and T. fenestratus. Both T. bruneus and T. eiseni were heavier after one month with T. bruneus gaining significantly more weight than T. eiseni. Greater percentages of algae were grazed by T. bruneus of increasing weight, although this relationship was not found for T. eiseni and T. fenestratus. All three species were generally active and remained within the water for the vast majority of time, although a small, but significant amount of time was spent out of the water for T. eiseni. T. fenestratus were significantly less active than T. bruneus, although the mean activity of T. eiseni was not significantly different from either species. T. bruneus out performs the other two species as a cleaning organism especially in the context of fluctuating water quality, thus highlighting the varying suitability of organisms for this task. Preference in the ornamental trade should be given to T. bruneus over the other topshells, but accurate species identification is critical."
29953460," We hypothesized (1) that gastrointestinal (GI) and renal adverse events (AE) would occur more often in infants first prescribed ibuprofen before rather than after six months of age and (2) that ibuprofen would be associated with more adverse effects than acetaminophen in infants younger than six months. We created two partly overlapping retrospective cohorts of infants aged less than six months when California Medicaid first paid for ibuprofen or acetaminophen between 2004 and 2010. In the first cohort we compared the incidence rate ratio (RR) of GI and renal AE between those infants first prescribed ibuprofen before six months of age with those first prescribed ibuprofen after six months of age. In the second cohort we compared the RR of GI and renal AE between infants younger than six months prescribed ibuprofen (+/-acetaminophen) with those prescribed only acetaminophen. We identified 41,669 prescriptions for ibuprofen and 176,991 prescriptions for acetaminophen in 180,333 eligible infants (median age 2.1 months). We did not observe higher RR of any AE in infants first prescribed ibuprofen before rather than after six months of age. Most infants prescribed ibuprofen were also prescribed acetaminophen. Any GI (adjusted (a)RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13-1.38) and moderate or severe GI AE (aRR 1.24, 95% CI 1.09-1.40) were more common in infants younger than six months who were prescribed ibuprofen versus acetaminophen alone. Severe GI (aRR 0.63, 95% CI 0.27-1.45) and renal AE (aRR 1.84 95% CI 0.66-5.19) were not different between the ibuprofen (+/-acetaminophen) and acetaminophen-only groups. GI and renal AEs were not higher in infants younger than six months who were prescribed ibuprofen compared with those aged six to 12 months. AEs were increased in infants younger than six months who were prescribed ibuprofen compared with infants who were prescribed acetaminophen alone."
29953459," In MRI, subject motion results in image artifacts. High-resolution 3D scans, like MPRAGE, are particularly susceptible to motion because of long scan times and acquisition of data over multiple-shots. Such motion related artifacts have been shown to cause a bias in cortical measures extracted from segmentation of high-resolution MPRAGE images. Prospective motion correction (PMC) techniques have been developed to help mitigate artifacts due to subject motion. In this work, high-resolution MPRAGE images are acquired during intentional head motion to evaluate the effectiveness of navigator-based PMC techniques to improve both the accuracy and reproducibility of cortical morphometry measures obtained from image segmentation. The contribution of reacquiring segments of k-space affected by motion to the overall performance of PMC is assessed. Additionally, the effect of subject motion on subcortical structure volumes is investigated. In the presence of head motion, navigator-based PMC is shown to improve both the accuracy and reproducibility of cortical and subcortical measures. It is shown that reacquiring segments of k-space data that are corrupted by motion is an essential part of navigator-based PMC performance. Subcortical structure volumes are not affected by motion in the same way as cortical measures; there is not a consistent underestimation."
29953458," The role of intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC) during cholecystectomy is debated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility, benefit and risk of performing systematic IOC in patients undergoing cholecystectomy for acute gallstone-related disease. Between July 2013 and January 2015, all patients admitted for an acute gallstone-related condition and undergoing same-hospital-stay cholecystectomy were prospectively followed. IOC was systematically attempted and predictors of IOC failure were analyzed. Among the 581 enrolled patients, IOC was deliberately not performed in 3 cases. IOC was successful in 509/578 patients (88.1%). The main predictors of IOC failure were age, body mass index, male gender and associated acute cholecystitis. Thirty-two patients with suspected common bile duct stone on IOC underwent 38 unnecessary negative postoperative common bile duct investigations (32/509, 6.3%). There was one IOC-related adverse outcome (mild pancreatitis, 1/578, 0.2%). IOC can be successfully and safely performed in the majority of patients undergoing cholecystectomy for acute gallstone-related disease. Although its positive predictive value is suboptimal and results in a number of unnecessary postoperative common bile duct investigations, IOC accurately rules out common bile duct stones in patients with acute gallstone-related conditions."
29953457," Both household food insecurity and household dietary diversity have been found reliable in describing the dietary intake of a population. However, it had not been proven as reliable instrument for assessing nutritional status of individuals in a clinical context. There has been a need for evidence on the validity of using proxy and easy dietary indicators for nutritional status. A facility based cross sectional study design was employed on 423 people with HIV infection visiting all ART clinics in Bahir Dar, North Ethiopia. Nutritional status was determined by computing BMI. Food insecurity was assessed using household food insecurity access scale. Dietary diversity was measured using a tool adopted from Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance Project. Data were entered to Epidata version 3.1and analyzed by SPSS version 20. Reliability analysis, sensitivity and specificity analysis were determined. The sensitivity of the household food insecurity access scale and dietary diversity score was 87.9% and 79.8%, respectively, while their specificity was 56.2% and 70.2%. The AUC at 95% CI for the household food insecurity access scale and household dietary diversity score were 73.4 (68.4-78.4) and 73.1 (68.1-78.2) while their cut of point that maximized their sensitivity and specificity was 1 and 6 respectively. Household food insecurity access scale and household dietary diversity score were found to be reliable tools with a Cronbach's Alpha of 0.926 and 0.799, respectively. In assessing under nutrition among PLHIV especially in limited resource settings, both the household food insecurity access scale and household dietary diversity score were found valid and reliable proxy indicators for measuring nutritional status."
29953456," The Triple Code Model (TCM) of numerical cognition argues for the existence of three representational codes for number: Arabic digits, verbal number words, and analog nonsymbolic magnitude representations, each subserved by functionally dissociated neural substrates. Despite the popularity of the TCM, no study to date has explored all three numerical codes within one fMRI paradigm. We administered three tasks, associated with each of the aforementioned numerical codes, in order to explore the neural correlates of numerosity processing in a sample of adults (N = 46). Independent task-control contrast analyses revealed task-dependent activity in partial support of the model, but also highlight the inherent complexity of a distributed and overlapping fronto-parietal network involved in all numerical codes. The results indicate that the TCM correctly predicts the existence of some functionally dissociated neural substrates, but requires an update that accounts for interactions with attentional processes. Parametric contrasts corresponding to differences in task difficulty revealed specific neural correlates of the distance effect, where closely spaced numbers become more difficult to discriminate than numbers spaced further apart. A conjunction analysis illustrated overlapping neural correlates across all tasks, in line with recent proposals for a fronto-parietal network of number processing. We additionally provide tentative results suggesting the involvement of format-independent numerosity-sensitive retinotopic maps in the early visual stream, extending previous findings of nonsymbolic stimulus selectivity. We discuss the functional roles of the components associated with the model, as well as the purported fronto-parietal network, and offer arguments in favor of revising the TCM."
29953455," Fluid resuscitation is the cornerstone of treatment in hemorrhagic shock. Despite increasing doubts, several guidelines recommend to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 mmHg as the most frequent indication of fluid therapy. Our aim was to investigate the effects of a MAP-guided management in a bleeding-resuscitation animal experiment. After anesthesia and instrumentation (tbsl) animals were bled till the initial stroke volume index dropped by 50% (t0). Fluid replacement was performed in 4 equivalent steps (t1-4) with balanced crystalloid solution to reach the baseline values of MAP. Invasive hemodynamic measurements and blood gas analyses were performed after each step. Mean arterial pressure dropped from tbsl to t0 (114±11 vs 76.9±16.9 mmHg, p<0.001) and returned to baseline by t4 (101.4±14.4 mmHg). From tbsl-t0 stroke volume index (SVI), cardiac index (CI) decreased (SVI: 40±8.6 vs 19.3±3.6 ml/m2, p<0.001; CI: 3.4±0.3 vs 1.9±0.3 l/min/m2, p<0.001), pulse pressure variation (PPV) increased (13.2±4.3 vs 22.1±4.3%, p<0.001). There was a decrease in oxygen delivery (464±45 vs 246±26.9 ml/min, p<0.001), central venous oxygen saturation (82.8±5.4 vs 53.6±12.1%, p<0.001) and increase in lactate levels (1.6±0.4 vs 3.5±1.6 mmol/l, p<0.005). SVI, CI and PPV returned to their initial values by t2. To normalize MAP fluid therapy had to be continued till t4, with the total infused volume of 4.5±0.8 l. In the current experiment bleeding led to hemorrhagic shock, while MAP remained higher than 65 mmHg. Furthermore, MAP was unable to indicate the normalization of SVI, CI and PPV that resulted in unnecessary fluid administration. Our data give further evidence that MAP may be an inappropriate parameter to follow during fluid resuscitation."
29953453," Mutation rates can evolve through genetic drift, indirect selection due to genetic hitchhiking, or direct selection on the physicochemical cost of high fidelity. However, for many systems, it has been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their extremely high mutation rates are advantageous because they may allow for increased adaptability. This argument has profound implications because it suggests that pathogenesis in many viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here, we present data for an alternative model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3DG64S, has a significant replication defect and that wild-type (WT) and 3DG64S populations have similar adaptability in 2 distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3DG64S under selection for replicative speed led to reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3DG64S exhibited delayed morbidity at doses well above the lethal level, consistent with attenuation by slower growth as opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3DG64S growth defect restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more important than accuracy. In contrast with what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find that within-host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic diversity."
29953452," Spatial distribution is an important topic in community ecology and a key to understanding the structure and dynamics of populations and communities. However, the available information related to the spatial patterns of soil mite communities in long-term tillage agroecosystems remains insufficient. In this study, we examined the spatial patterns of soil mite communities to explain the spatial relationships between soil mite communities and soil parameters. Soil fauna were sampled three times (August, September and October 2015) at 121 locations arranged regularly within a 400 m × 400 m monitoring plot. Additionally, we estimated the physical and chemical parameters of the same sampling locations. The distribution patterns of the soil mite community and the edaphic parameters were analyzed using a range of geostatistical tools. Moran's I coefficient showed that, during each sampling period, the total abundance of the soil mite communities and the abundance of the dominant mite populations were spatially autocorrelated. The soil mite communities demonstrated clear patchy distribution patterns within the study plot. These patterns were sampling period-specific. Cross-semivariograms showed both negative and positive cross-correlations between soil mite communities and environmental factors. Mantel tests showed a significant and positive relationship between soil mite community and soil organic matter and soil pH only in August. This study demonstrated that in the cornfield, the soil mite distribution exhibited strong or moderate spatial dependence, and the mites formed patches with sizes less than one hundred meters. In addition, in this long-term tillage agroecosystem, soil factors had less influence on the observed pattern of soil mite communities. Further experiments that take into account human activity and spatial factors should be performed to study the factors that drive the spatial distribution of soil microarthropods."
29953451," There is a paucity of data on the epidemiology of sepsis in outborn neonates being referred to level-3 units in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The objective of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of sepsis and outcomes of outborn neonates with sepsis, and to characterize the pathogen profile and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of common isolates in them. In this prospective observational cohort study (2011-2015), a dedicated research team enrolled all neonates admitted to an outborn level-3 neonatal unit and followed them until discharge/death. Sepsis work-up including blood culture(s) was performed upon suspicion of sepsis. All the isolates were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Gram-negative pathogens resistant to any three of the five antibiotic classes (extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and piperacillin-tazobactam) were labeled multi-drug resistant. Of the total of 2588 neonates enrolled, culture positive sepsis and total sepsis-i.e. culture positive and/or culture negative sepsis-was diagnosed in 13.1% (95% CI 11.8% to 14.5%) and 54.7% (95% CI 52.8% to 56.6%), respectively. The case fatality rates were 23.4% and 11.0% in culture-positive and total sepsis, respectively. Sepsis accounted for two-thirds of total neonatal deaths (153/235, 63.0%). Bacterial isolates caused about three-fourths (296/401; 73.8%) of the infections. The two common pathogens-Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 50, 12.5%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 46, 11.5%)-showed high degree of multi-drug resistance (78.0% and 91.3%, respectively) and carbapenem resistance (84.0% and 91.3%, respectively). About a quarter of infections were caused by Candida spp. (n = 91; 22.7%); almost three-fourths (73.7%) of these infections occurred in neonates born at or after 32 weeks' gestation and about two-thirds (62.1%) in those weighing 1500 g or more at birth. In this large outborn cohort, we report high burden of sepsis, high prevalence of systemic fungal infections, and alarming rates of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens."
29953450," Studies on monolayer cultures and whole-animal models for the prediction of the response of native human tissue are associated with limitations. Therefore, more and more laboratories are tending towards multicellular spheroids grown in vitro as a model of native tissues. In addition, they are increasingly used in a wide range of biofabrication methodologies. These 3D microspheroids are generated through a self-assembly process that is still poorly characterised, called cellular aggregation. Here, a system is proposed for the automated, non-invasive and high throughput monitoring of the morphological changes during cell aggregation. Microwell patterned inserts were used for spheroid formation while an automated microscope with 4x bright-field objective captured the morphological changes during this process. Subsequently, the acquired time-lapse images were automatically segmented and several morphological features such as minor axis length, major axis length, roundness, area, perimeter and circularity were extracted for each spheroid. The method was quantitatively validated with respect to manual segmentation on four sets of ± 60 spheroids. The average sensitivities and precisions of the proposed segmentation method ranged from 96.67-97.84% and 96.77-97.73%, respectively. In addition, the different morphological features were validated, obtaining average relative errors between 0.78-4.50%. On average, a spheroid was processed 73 times faster than a human operator. As opposed to existing algorithms, our methodology was not only able to automatically monitor compact spheroids but also the aggregation process of individual spheroids, and this in an accurate and high-throughput manner. In total, the aggregation behaviour of more than 700 individual spheroids was monitored over a duration of 16 hours with a time interval of 5 minutes, and this could be increased up to 48,000 for the described culture format. In conclusion, the proposed system has the potential to be used for unravelling the mechanisms involved in spheroid formation and monitoring their formation during large-scale manufacturing protocols."
29953449," HIV has a high mutation rate, which contributes to its ability to evolve quickly. However, we know little about the fitness costs of individual HIV mutations in vivo, their distribution and the different factors shaping the viral fitness landscape. We calculated the mean frequency of transition mutations at 870 sites of the pol gene in 160 patients, allowing us to determine the cost of these mutations. As expected, we found high costs for non-synonymous and nonsense mutations as compared to synonymous mutations. In addition, we found that non-synonymous mutations that lead to drastic amino acid changes are twice as costly as those that do not and mutations that create new CpG dinucleotides are also twice as costly as those that do not. We also found that G→A and C→T mutations are more costly than A→G mutations. We anticipate that our new in vivo frequency-based approach will provide insights into the fitness landscape and evolvability of not only HIV, but a variety of microbes."
29953448," Both in DNA and protein contexts, an important method for modelling motifs is to utilize position weight matrix (PWM) in biological sequences. With the development of genome sequencing technology, the quantity of the sequence data is increasing explosively, so the faster searching algorithms which have the ability to meet the increasingly need are desired to develop. In this paper, we proposed a method for speeding up the searching process of candidate transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), and the users can be allowed to specify p threshold to get the desired trade-off between speed and sensitivity for a particular sequence analysis. Moreover, the proposed method can also be generalized to large-scale annotation and sequence projects."
29953447," Previous research has documented that incidentally processed action-words can produce corresponding behavior and that affective-motivational processes modulate these effects. The present study aimed to (1) replicate earlier work showing that behavioral effects of exposure to social affiliation related action-words (e.g., socialize, party, going-out) cease when these action-words are co-activated with negative stimuli, (2) probe moderation effects of individual differences in the affiliation motive, and (3) examine whether action-word priming effects on behavior rely on specific-word associations rather than the activation of a broad concept. Results of an experimental study (N = 191) showed that exposure-effects of affiliation related words on behavior instrumental in attaining affiliation goals cease when these words were co-activated with negative affect, but this cessation effect was relatively weak and non-significant. Subsequent analyses revealed that the effect was moderated by the affiliation motive: The cessation effect mainly occurred for individuals with a strong affiliation motive. Further, we found no evidence that word priming effects do merely occur via specific-word associations."
29953446," Complications arising from infection with the carcinogenic liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini cause substantial morbidity and mortality in Thailand and adjacent lower Mekong countries. In parallel, the incidence rate of diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing in this same region, and indeed worldwide. Many residents in opisthorchiasis-endemic regions also exhibit DM, but the hepatobiliary disease arising during the co-occurrence of these two conditions remains to be characterized. Here, the histopathological profile during co-occurrence of opisthorchiasis and DM was investigated in a rodent model of human opisthorchiasis in which diabetes was induced with streptozotocin. The effects of excretory/secretory products from the liver fluke, O. viverrini (OVES) on hepatocyte and cholangiocyte responses during hyperglycemic conditions also were monitored. Both the liver fluke-infected hamsters (OV group) and hamsters with DM lost weight compared to control hamsters. Weight loss was even more marked in the hamsters with both opisthorchiasis and DM (OD group). Hypertrophy of hepatocytes, altered biliary canaliculi, and biliary hyperplasia were more prominent in the OD group, compared with OV and DM groups. Profound oxidative DNA damage, evidenced by 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and periductal fibrosis characterized the OD compared to OV and DM hamsters. Upregulation of expression of cytokines in response to infection and impairment of the pathway for insulin receptor substrate (IRS)/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling attended these changes. In vitro, OVES and glucose provoked time- and dose-dependent effects on the proliferation of both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. In overview, the co-occurrence of opisthorchiasis and diabetes exacerbated pathophysiological damage to the hepatobiliary tract. We speculate that opisthorchiasis and diabetes together aggravate hepatobiliary pathogenesis through an IRS/PI3K/AKT-independent pathway."
29953445," The effect of plant population density (PPD) and root-induced leaf cytokinin on the compensatory growth of potted corn seedlings during post-drought rewatering was investigated. The study design comprised four treatments: (1) wetness with low PPD, (2) wetness with high PPD, (3) rewatering with low PPD, and (4) rewatering with high PPD. Results showed that drought stress restrained the growth of corns. By contrast, rewatering enhanced the net photosynthetic rate and growth of corns. During the 8 days of rewatering, compensatory growth during post-drought rewatering occurred in corns with high PPD; however, such compensatory growth did not occur in corns with low PPD. Zeatin riboside concentrations in leaves and xylem saps were significantly higher under rewatering treatment than those under wet treatment. High leaf cytokinin concentration accelerated corn growth. The coefficients of variation and Gini-coefficient of wet treatment were significantly higher than those of rewatering treatment under high PPD, demonstrating that intense intraspecific competition occurred in the wet treatment. Extreme intraspecific competition negatively affected net photosynthetic rate. In brief, the interactions between root-induced leaf cytokinin and weak intraspecific competition promoted the compensatory growth under high PPD."
29953444," African Americans, East Asians, and Hispanics with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) are more likely to develop lupus nephritis (LN) than are SLE patients of European descent. The etiology of this difference is not clear, and this study was undertaken to investigate how genetic variants might explain this effect. In this cross-sectional study, 1244 SLE patients from multiethnic case collections were genotyped for 817,810 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. Continental genetic ancestry was estimated utilizing the program ADMIXTURE. Gene-based testing and pathway analysis was performed within each ethnic group and meta-analyzed across ethnicities. We also performed candidate SNP association tests with SNPs previously established as risk alleles for SLE, LN, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Association testing and logistic regression models were performed with LN as the outcome, adjusted for continental ancestries, sex, disease duration, and age. We studied 255 North European, 263 South European, 238 Hispanic, 224 African American and 264 East Asian SLE patients, of whom 606 had LN (48.7%). In genome-wide gene-based and candidate SNP analyses, we found distinct genes, pathways and established risk SNPs associated with LN for each ethnic group. Gene-based analyses showed significant associations between variation in ZNF546 (p = 1.0E-06), TRIM15 (p = 1.0E-06), and TRIMI0 (p = 1.0E-06) and LN among South Europeans, and TTC34 (p = 8.0E-06) was significantly associated with LN among Hispanics. The SNP rs8091180 in NFATC1 was associated with LN (OR 1.43, p = 3.3E-04) in the candidate SNP meta-analysis with the highest OR among African-Americans (OR 2.17, p = 0.0035). Distinct genetic factors are associated with the risk of LN in SLE patients of different ethnicities. CKD risk alleles may play a role in the development of LN in addition to SLE-associated risk variants. These findings may further explain the clinical heterogeneity of LN risk and response to therapy observed between different ethnic groups."
29953443," Mandibular distraction is a surgical process that progressively lengthens bone. To improve the distraction procedure and devices, the load of distraction and the mechanical strain of soft tissues during the process must be determined. We tested the assumption that it could be the periosteum primarily opposing distraction. Therefore we assessed the mechanical properties of the human mandibular periosteum and compared the stress-strain data with the torque measured on the activator during a cadaveric mandibular distraction. A 20 mm horizontal mandibular distraction was performed in 7 cadavers using standard distractors. Torque was measured with a torquemeter placed on the activation rods of the devices, providing a load (Lt) for each millimeter of distraction. In parallel, 18 periosteum samples were harvested from 9 cadaver mandibles. Uniaxial tensile tests were performed on the specimens and an estimated load (Lc) was calculated using periosteal stress-strain data and mandibular dimensions. During the distraction process, we observed an increase of the load Lt from 11.6 to 50.6 N. The periosteum exhibited a nonlinear viscoelastic stress-strain relationship, typical of biological tissues composed of collagen and elastin. The median Lc and Lt were not significantly different for the first millimeter of distraction. We demonstrated the periosteum is primarily responsible for opposing the distraction load."
29953442," Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is the most common hereditary disorder in adults, but is under-recognized. In Spain, the number of patients diagnosed with AATD is much lower than expected according to epidemiologic studies. The objectives of this study were to assess the frequency and determinants of testing serum α1-antitrypsin (AAT) levels in COPD patients, and to describe factors associated with testing. EPOCONSUL is a cross-sectional clinical audit, recruiting consecutive COPD cases over one year. The study evaluated serum AAT level determination in COPD patients and associations between individual, disease-related, and hospital characteristics. A total of 4,405 clinical records for COPD patients from 57 Spanish hospitals were evaluated. Only 995 (22.5%) patients had serum AAT tested on some occasion. A number of patient characteristics (being male [OR 0.5, p < 0.001], ≤55 years old [OR 2.38, p<0.001], BMI≤21 kg/m2 [OR 1.71, p<0.001], FEV1(%)<50% [OR 1.35, p<0.001], chronic bronchitis [OR 0.79, p < 0.001], Charlson index ≥ 3 [OR 0.66, p < 0.001], or history or symptoms of asthma [OR 1.32, p<0.001]), and management at a specialized COPD outpatient clinic [OR 2.73,p<0.001] were identified as factors independently associated with ever testing COPD patients for AATD. Overall, 114 COPD patients (11.5% of those tested) had AATD. Of them, 26 (22.8%) patients had severe deficiency. Patients with AATD were younger, with a low pack-year index, and were more likely to have emphysema (p<0.05). Testing of AAT blood levels in COPD patients treated at outpatient respiratory clinics in Spain is infrequent. However, when tested, AATD (based on the serum AAT levels ≤100 mg/dL) is detected in one in five COPD patients. Efforts to optimize AATD case detection in COPD are needed."
29953441," Physical activity is associated with a lower risk of breast, colon, and endometrial cancer. Epigenetic mechanisms such as changes in DNA methylation may help to explain these protective effects. We assessed the impact of a one year aerobic exercise intervention on DNA methylation biomarkers believed to play a role in carcinogenesis. The Alberta Physical Activity and Breast Cancer Prevention (ALPHA) Trial was a two-armed randomized controlled trial in 320 healthy, inactive, postmenopausal women with no history of cancer. In an ancillary analysis, frozen blood samples (n = 256) were reassessed for levels of DNA methylation within LINE-1 and Alu repeats as well as within the promoter regions of APC, BRCA1, RASSF1, and hTERT genes. Differences between the exercise and control arm at 12-months, after adjusting for baseline values, were estimated within an intent-to-treat and per-protocol analysis using linear regression. No significant differences in DNA methylation between the exercise and control arms were observed. In an exploratory analysis, we found that the prospective change in estimated VO2max was negatively associated with RASSF1 methylation in a dose-response manner (p-trend = 0.04). A year-long aerobic exercise intervention does not affect LINE-1, Alu, APC, BRCA1, RASSF1, or hTERT methylation in healthy, inactive, postmenopausal women. Changes in DNA methylation within these genomic regions may not mediate the association between physical activity and cancer in healthy postmenopausal women. Additional research is needed to validate our findings with RASSF1 methylation. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00522262."
29953440," Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) is a human pathogen and the causative agent for leprosy, a chronic disease characterized by lesions of the skin and peripheral nerve damage. Zoonotic transmission of M. leprae to humans by nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus) has been shown to occur in the southern United States, mainly in Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. Nine-banded armadillos are also common in South America, and residents living in some areas in Brazil hunt and kill armadillos as a dietary source of protein. This study examines the extent of M. leprae infection in wild armadillos and whether these New World mammals may be a natural reservoir for leprosy transmission in Brazil, similar to the situation in the southern states of the U.S. The presence of the M. leprae-specific repetitive sequence RLEP was detected by PCR amplification in purified DNA extracted from armadillo spleen and liver tissue samples. A positive RLEP signal was confirmed in 62% of the armadillos (10/16), indicating high rates of infection with M. leprae. Immunohistochemistry of sections of infected armadillo spleens revealed mycobacterial DNA and cell wall constituents in situ detected by SYBR Gold and auramine/rhodamine staining techniques, respectively. The M. leprae-specific antigen, phenolic glycolipid I (PGL-I) was detected in spleen sections using a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for PGL-I. Anti-PGL-I titers were assessed by ELISA in sera from 146 inhabitants of Belterra, a hyperendemic city located in western Pará state in Brazil. A positive anti-PGL-I titer is a known biomarker for M. leprae infection in both humans and armadillos. Individuals who consumed armadillo meat most frequently (more than once per month) showed a significantly higher anti-PGL-I titer than those who did not eat or ate less frequently than once per month. Armadillos infected with M. leprae represent a potential environmental reservoir. Consequently, people who hunt, kill, or process or eat armadillo meat are at a higher risk for infection with M. leprae from these animals."
29953439," Previous research in various species has shown that granulocyte-colony stimulating factor stimulates the production and release of neutrophils from bone marrow. The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of polyethylene glycol-bound bovine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (pegbovigrastim; Imrestor, Elanco) on circulating leukocyte counts. Thirty-four Holstein cows were randomly assigned to receive 2 injections of either physiologic saline (n = 16) or pegbovigrastim (n = 18), 7 days before expected calving (d -7) and within 24 hours after calving (d 0). Cows were sampled at d -7, d -6, d 0, d +1, d +7, and d +21, relative to calving. Only cows for which the interval from the first injection to calving was ≥ 4 d and ≤ 10 d were included, such that the interval (mean ± SD) from first treatment to calving was 6.7 ± 1.9 d. Treatment effects were assessed with mixed linear regression models. After the first injection, neutrophil counts (×109/ L) in pegbovigrastim-treated cows increased from 4.3 (95% CI 3.8 to 4.8) at d -7 to 18.2 (CI 16.3 to 20.3) at d -6 (P < 0.0001). Their counts then decreased from d -6 to d 0, when the second injection was administered, at a rate of -0.31 ×109 neutrophils/L/day (P < 0.0001). After the second injection, neutrophil counts increased from 16.4 (CI 13.7 to 19.6) at d 0 to 32.8 (CI 25.2 to 42.7) at d +1 (P < 0.0001), after which counts decreased at a rate of -3.73 ×109 neutrophils/L/day until d +7 (P < 0.0001). Counts continued to decrease from d +7 to d +21 at a slower rate of -0.43 ×109 neutrophils/L/day (P < 0.0001), until baseline levels were reached. Conversely, in control cows, neutrophil counts were unchanged from d -7 to d -6 (P = 0.86) after the first injection and then decreased from 6.1 (CI 5.0-7.3) at d 0, to 3.2 (CI 2.4-4.2) at d +1 (P < 0.0001) after the second injection. Neutrophil count was greater (P < 0.001) in pegbovigrastim-treated than in control cows at days -6, 0, +1 and +7. Area under the curve (cells ×109/ L per 28 d) for neutrophil counts in the pegbovigrastim group was 429, versus 99 in the control group (P < 0.0001). The response to each injection of pegbovigrastim was additive and consisted of 95% segmented neutrophils, suggesting that the effect of the treatment was to release mature neutrophils from a substantial pool available in the bone marrow. The sustained increase in circulating neutrophil count around the time of calving may contribute to improved health during the peripartum transition period."
29953438," Dengue is a febrile illness transmitted by mosquitoes, causing disease across the tropical and sub-tropical world. Antibody prevalence data and serotype distributions describe population-level risk and inform public health decision-making. In this cross-sectional study we used data from a pediatric dengue seroprevalence study to describe historical dengue serotype circulation, according to age and geographic location. A sub-sample of 780 dengue IgG-positive sera, collected from 30 sites across urban Indonesia in 2014, were tested by the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) to measure the prevalence and concentration of serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies according to subject age and geography. PRNT results were obtained from 776 subjects with mean age of 9.6 years. 765 (98.6%) neutralized one or more dengue serotype at a threshold of >10 (1/dil). Multitypic profiles were observed in 50.9% of the samples; a proportion which increased to 63.1% in subjects aged 15-18 years. Amongst monotypic samples, the highest proportion was reactive against DENV-2, followed by DENV-1, and DENV-3, with some variation across the country. DENV-4 was the least common serotype. The highest anti-dengue antibody titers were recorded against DENV-2, and increased with age to a geometric mean of 516.5 [1/dil] in the oldest age group. We found that all four dengue serotypes have been widely circulating in most of urban Indonesia, and more than half of children had already been exposed to >1 dengue serotype, demonstrating intense transmission often associated with more severe clinical episodes. These data will help inform policymakers and highlight the importance of dengue surveillance, prevention and control."
29953437," A major goal of cancer genomics is to identify somatic mutations that play a role in tumor initiation or progression. Somatic mutations within transcription factors are of particular interest, as gene expression dysregulation is widespread in cancers. The substantial gene expression variation evident across tumors suggests that numerous regulatory factors are likely to be involved and that somatic mutations within them may not occur at high frequencies across patient cohorts, thereby complicating efforts to uncover which ones are cancer-relevant. Here we analyze somatic mutations within the largest family of human transcription factors, namely those that bind DNA via Cys2His2 zinc finger domains. Specifically, to hone in on important mutations within these genes, we aggregated somatic mutations across all of them by their positions within Cys2His2 zinc finger domains. Remarkably, we found that for three classes of cancers profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma, Colon and Rectal Adenocarcinomas, and Skin Cutaneous Melanoma-two specific, functionally important positions within zinc finger domains are mutated significantly more often than expected by chance, with alterations in 18%, 10% and 43% of tumors, respectively. Numerous zinc finger genes are affected, with those containing Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) repressor domains preferentially targeted by these mutations. Further, the genes with these mutations also have high overall missense mutation rates, are expressed at levels comparable to those of known cancer genes, and together have biological process annotations that are consistent with roles in cancers. Altogether, we introduce evidence broadly implicating mutations within a diverse set of zinc finger proteins as relevant for cancer, and propose that they contribute to the widespread transcriptional dysregulation observed in cancer cells."
29953436," ATCC HIV-1 drug resistance test kit was designed to detect HIV-1 drug resistance (HIVDR) mutations in the protease and reverse transcriptase genes for all HIV-1 group M subtypes and circulating recombinant forms. The test has been validated for both plasma and dried blood spot specimen types with viral load (VL) of ≥1000 copies/ml. We performed an in-country assessment on the kit to determine the genotyping sensitivity and its accuracy in detecting HIVDR mutations using plasma samples stored under suboptimal conditions. Among 572 samples with VL ≥1000 copies/ml that had been genotyped by ViroSeq assay, 183 were randomly selected, including 85 successful genotyped and 98 unsuccessful genotyped samples. They were tested with ATCC kits following the manufacturer's instructions. Sequence identity and HIVDR patterns were analysed with Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance HIVdb program. Of the 183 samples, 127 (69.4%) were successfully genotyped by either method. While ViroSeq system genotyped 85/183 (46.5%) with median VL of 32,971 (IQR: 11,150-96,506) copies/ml, ATCC genotyped 115/183 (62.8%) samples with median VL of 23,068 (IQR: 7,397-86,086) copies/ml. Of the 98 unsuccessful genotyped samples with ViroSeq assay, 42 (42.9%) samples with lower median VL of 13,906 (IQR: 6,122-72,329) copies/ml were successfully genotyped using ATCC. Sequence identity analysis revealed that the sequences generated by both methods were >98% identical and yielded similar HIVDR profiles at individual patient level. This study confirms that ATCC kit showed greater sensitivity in genotyping plasma samples stored in suboptimal conditions experiencing frequent and prolonged power outage. Thus, it is more sensitive particularly for subtypes A and A/G HIV-1 in resource-limited settings."
29953435," Descent of testes from a position near the kidneys into the lower abdomen or into the scrotum is an important developmental process that occurs in all placental mammals, with the exception of five afrotherian lineages. Since soft-tissue structures like testes are not preserved in the fossil record and since key parts of the placental mammal phylogeny remain controversial, it has been debated whether testicular descent is the ancestral or derived condition in placental mammals. To resolve this debate, we used genomic data of 71 mammalian species and analyzed the evolution of two key genes (relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 2 [RXFP2] and insulin-like 3 [INSL3]) that induce the development of the gubernaculum, the ligament that is crucial for testicular descent. We show that both RXFP2 and INSL3 are lost or nonfunctional exclusively in four afrotherians (tenrec, cape elephant shrew, cape golden mole, and manatee) that completely lack testicular descent. The presence of remnants of once functional orthologs of both genes in these afrotherian species shows that these gene losses happened after the split from the placental mammal ancestor. These ""molecular vestiges"" provide strong evidence that testicular descent is the ancestral condition, irrespective of persisting phylogenetic discrepancies. Furthermore, the absence of shared gene-inactivating mutations and our estimates that the loss of RXFP2 happened at different time points strongly suggest that testicular descent was lost independently in Afrotheria. Our results provide a molecular mechanism that explains the loss of testicular descent in afrotherians and, more generally, highlight how molecular vestiges can provide insights into the evolution of soft-tissue characters."
29953434," In South Africa, access to second-trimester abortion services, which are generally performed using medical induction with misoprostol alone, is challenging for many women. We aimed to estimate the costs and cost effectiveness of providing three safe second-trimester abortion services (dilation and evacuation (D&E)), medical induction with mifepristone and misoprostol (MI-combined), or medical induction with misoprostol alone (MI-misoprostol)) in Western Cape Province, South Africa to aid policymakers with planning for service provision in South Africa and similar settings. We derived clinical outcomes data for this economic evaluation from two previously conducted clinical studies. In 2013-2014, we collected cost data from three public hospitals where the studies took place. We collected cost data from the health service perspective through micro-costing activities, including discussions with site staff. We used decision tree analysis to estimate average costs per patient interaction (e.g. first visit, procedure visit, etc.), the total average cost per procedure, and cost-effectiveness in terms of the cost per complete abortion. We discounted equipment costs at 3%, and present the results in 2015 US dollars. D&E services were the least costly and the most cost-effective at $91.17 per complete abortion. MI-combined was also less costly and more cost-effective (at $298.03 per complete abortion) than MI-misoprostol (at $375.31 per complete abortion), in part due to a shortened inpatient stay. However, an overlap in the plausible cost ranges for the two medical procedures suggests that the two may have equivalent costs in some circumstances. D&E was most cost-effective in this analysis. However, due to resistance from health care providers and other barriers, these services are not widely available and scale-up is challenging. Given South Africa's reliance on medical induction, switching to the combined regimen could result in greater access to second-trimester services due to shorter inpatient stays without increasing costs."
29953431," Chronic conditions and disorders (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, and depression) are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Healthy behaviors (e.g., physical activity, avoiding cigarette use, and refraining from binge drinking) and preventive practices (e.g., visiting a doctor for a routine check-up, tracking blood pressure, and monitoring blood cholesterol) might help prevent or successfully manage these chronic conditions. Monitoring chronic diseases, health-risk behaviors, and access to and use of health care are fundamental to the development of effective public health programs and policies at the state and local levels. January-December 2015. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an ongoing, state-based, random-digit-dialed landline- and cellular-telephone survey of noninstitutionalized adults aged ≥18 years residing in the United States. BRFSS collects data on health-risk behaviors, chronic diseases and conditions, access to and use of health care, and use of preventive health services related to the leading causes of death and disability. This report presents results for all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico), and Guam and for 130 metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas (MMSAs) (N = 441,456 respondents) for 2015. The age-adjusted prevalence estimates of health-risk behaviors, self-reported chronic health conditions, access to and use of health care, and use of preventive health services varied substantially by state, territory, and MMSA in 2015. Results are summarized for selected BRFSS measures. Each set of proportions refers to the median (range) of age-adjusted prevalence estimates for health-risk behaviors, self-reported chronic diseases or conditions, or use of preventive health care services by geographic jurisdiction, as reported by survey respondents. Adults with good or better health: 84.6% (65.9%-88.8%) for states and territories and 85.2% (66.9%-91.3%) for MMSAs. Adults with ≥14 days of poor physical health in the past 30 days: 10.9% (8.2%-17.2%) for states and territories and 10.9% (6.6%-19.1%) for MMSAs. Adults with ≥14 days of poor mental health in the past 30 days: 11.3% (7.3%-15.8%) for states and territories and 11.4% (5.6%-20.5%) for MMSAs. Adults aged 18-64 years with health care coverage: 86.8% (72.0%-93.8%) for states and territories and 86.8% (63.2%-95.7%) for MMSAs. Adults who received a routine physical checkup during the preceding 12 months: 69.0% (58.1%-79.8%) for states and territories and 69.4% (57.1%-81.1%) for MMSAs. Adults who ever had their blood cholesterol checked: 79.1% (73.3%-86.7%) for states and territories and 79.5% (65.1%-87.3%) for MMSAs. Current cigarette smoking among adults: 17.7% (9.0%-27.2%) for states and territories and 17.3% (4.5%-29.5%) for MMSAs. Binge drinking among adults during the preceding 30 days: 17.2% (11.2%-26.0%) for states and territories and 17.4% (5.5%-24.5%) for MMSAs. Adults who reported no leisure-time physical activity during the preceding month: 25.5% (17.6%-47.1%) for states and territories and 24.5% (16.1%-47.3%) for MMSAs. Adults who reported consuming fruit less than once per day during the preceding month: 40.5% (33.3%-55.5%) for states and territories and 40.3% (30.1%-57.3%) for MMSAs. Adults who reported consuming vegetables less than once per day during the preceding month: 22.4% (16.6%-31.3%) for states and territories and 22.3% (13.6%-32.0%) for MMSAs. Adults who have obesity: 29.5% (19.9%-36.0%) for states and territories and 28.5% (17.8%-41.6%) for MMSAs. Adults aged ≥45 years with diagnosed diabetes: 15.9% (11.2%-26.8%) for states and territories and 15.7% (10.5%-27.6%) for MMSAs. Adults aged ≥18 years with a form of arthritis: 22.7% (17.2%-33.6%) for states and territories and 23.2% (12.3%-33.9%) for MMSAs. Adults having had a depressive disorder: 19.0% (9.6%-27.0%) for states and territories and 19.2% (9.9%-27.2%) for MMSAs. Adults with high blood pressure: 29.1% (24.2%-39.9%) for states and territories and 29.0% (19.7%-41.0%) for MMSAs. Adults with high blood cholesterol: 31.8% (27.1%-37.3%) for states and territories and 31.4% (23.2%-42.0%) for MMSAs. Adults aged ≥45 years who have had coronary heart disease: 10.3% (7.2%-16.8%) for states and territories and 10.1% (4.7%-17.8%) for MMSAs. Adults aged ≥45 years who have had a stroke: 4.9% (2.5%-7.5%) for states and territories and 4.7% (2.1%-8.4%) for MMSAs. The prevalence of health care access and use, health-risk behaviors, and chronic health conditions varied by state, territory, and MMSA. The data in this report underline the importance of continuing to monitor chronic diseases, health-risk behaviors, and access to and use of health care in order to assist in the planning and evaluation of public health programs and policies at the state, territory, and MMSA level. State and local health departments and agencies and others interested in health and health care can continue to use BRFSS data to identify groups with or at high risk for chronic conditions, unhealthy behaviors, and limited health care access and use. BRFSS data also can be used to help design, implement, monitor, and evaluate health-related programs and policies."
29953430," Approximately 15,000 persons aged <20 years receive a cancer diagnosis each year in the United States (1). National surveillance data could provide understanding of geographic variation in occurrence of new cases to guide public health planning and investigation (2,3). Past research on pediatric cancer incidence described differences by U.S. Census region but did not provide state-level estimates (4). To adequately describe geographic variation in cancer incidence among persons aged <20 years in the United States, CDC analyzed data from United States Cancer Statistics (USCS) during 2003-2014 and identified 171,432 cases of pediatric cancer during this period (incidence = 173.7 cases per 1 million persons). The cancer types with the highest incidence rates were leukemias (45.7), brain tumors (30.9), and lymphomas (26.2). By U.S. Census region, pediatric cancer incidence was highest in the Northeast (188.0) and lowest in the South (168.0), whereas by state (including the District of Columbia [DC]), rates were highest in New Hampshire, DC, and New Jersey. Among non-Hispanic whites (whites) and non-Hispanic blacks (blacks), pediatric cancer incidence was highest in the Northeast, and the highest rates among Hispanics were in the South. The highest rates of leukemia were in the West, and the highest rates of lymphoma and brain tumors were in the Northeast. State-based differences in pediatric cancer incidence could guide interventions related to accessing care (e.g., in states with large distances to pediatric oncology centers), clinical trial enrollment, and state or regional studies designed to further explore variations in cancer incidence."
29953429," Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is critical to the control and elimination of tuberculosis disease (TB) in the United States. In 2011, CDC recommended a short-course combination regimen of once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine for 12 weeks (3HP) by directly observed therapy (DOT) for treatment of LTBI, with limitations for use in children aged <12 years and persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (1). CDC identified the use of 3HP in those populations, as well as self-administration of the 3HP regimen, as areas to address in updated recommendations. In 2017, a CDC Work Group conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of the 3HP regimen using methods adapted from the Guide to Community Preventive Services. In total, 19 articles representing 15 unique studies were included in the meta-analysis, which determined that 3HP is as safe and effective as other recommended LTBI regimens and achieves substantially higher treatment completion rates. In July 2017, the Work Group presented the meta-analysis findings to a group of TB experts, and in December 2017, CDC solicited input from the Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis (ACET) and members of the public for incorporation into the final recommendations. CDC continues to recommend 3HP for treatment of LTBI in adults and now recommends use of 3HP 1) in persons with LTBI aged 2-17 years; 2) in persons with LTBI who have HIV infection, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and are taking antiretroviral medications with acceptable drug-drug interactions with rifapentine; and 3) by DOT or self-administered therapy (SAT) in persons aged ≥2 years."
29953428," During August 2017, two separate clusters of platelet transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis were reported in Utah and California. In Utah, two patients died after platelet transfusions from the same donation. Clostridium perfringens isolates from one patient's blood, the other patient's platelet bag, and donor skin swabs were highly related by whole genome sequencing (WGS). In California, one patient died after platelet transfusion; Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from the patient's blood and platelet bag residuals and a nontransfused platelet unit were matched using WGS. Investigation revealed no deviations in blood supplier or hospital procedures. Findings in this report highlight that even when following current procedures, the risk for transfusion-related infection and fatality persists, making additional interventions necessary. Clinicians need to be vigilant in monitoring for platelet-transmitted bacterial infections and report adverse reactions to blood suppliers and hemovigilance systems. Blood suppliers and hospitals could consider additional evidence-based bacterial contamination risk mitigation strategies, including pathogen inactivation, rapid detection devices, and modified screening of bacterial culture protocols."
29953427," Since 2006, CDC has recommended routine, provider-initiated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening (i.e., HIV screening at least once in lifetime) for all patients aged 13-64 years in all health care settings (1). Whereas evidence related to the frequency of HIV testing is available, less is known about the prevalence and predictors of providers' HIV test offers to patients (2). National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) data from Virginia were used to examine the prevalence and predictors of provider-initiated HIV test offers to heterosexual adults aged 18-60 years at increased risk for HIV acquisition. In a sample of 333 persons who visited a health care provider in the 12 months before their NHBS interview, 194 (58%) reported not receiving an HIV test offer during that time, approximately one third of whom (71, 37%) also reported never having had an HIV test in their lifetime. In multivariable analysis, the prevalence of HIV test offers was significantly lower among men than among women (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.53-0.97). Provider-initiated HIV test offers are an important strategy for increasing HIV testing among heterosexual populations; there is a need for increased provider-initiated HIV screening among heterosexual adults who are at risk for acquiring HIV, especially men, who were less likely than women to be offered HIV screening in this study."
29953425," Outbreaks associated with untreated recreational water can be caused by pathogens, toxins, or chemicals in fresh water (e.g., lakes, rivers) or marine water (e.g., ocean). During 2000-2014, public health officials from 35 states and Guam voluntarily reported 140 untreated recreational water-associated outbreaks to CDC. These outbreaks resulted in at least 4,958 cases of disease and two deaths. Among the 95 outbreaks with a confirmed infectious etiology, enteric pathogens caused 80 (84%); 21 (22%) were caused by norovirus, 19 (20%) by Escherichia coli, 14 (15%) by Shigella, and 12 (13%) by Cryptosporidium. Investigations of these 95 outbreaks identified 3,125 cases; 2,704 (87%) were caused by enteric pathogens, including 1,459 (47%) by norovirus, 362 (12%) by Shigella, 314 (10%) by Cryptosporidium, and 155 (5%) by E. coli. Avian schistosomes were identified as the cause in 345 (11%) of the 3,125 cases. The two deaths were in persons affected by a single outbreak (two cases) caused by Naegleria fowleri. Public parks (50 [36%]) and beaches (45 [32%]) were the leading settings associated with the 140 outbreaks. Overall, the majority of outbreaks started during June-August (113 [81%]); 65 (58%) started in July. Swimmers and parents of young swimmers can take steps to minimize the risk for exposure to pathogens, toxins, and chemicals in untreated recreational water by heeding posted advisories closing the beach to swimming; not swimming in discolored, smelly, foamy, or scummy water; not swimming while sick with diarrhea; and limiting water entering the nose when swimming in warm freshwater."
29953424," BACKGROUND Ouabain, an inhibitor of Na+/K+-ATPase, is a type of endogenous hormone synthesized in the adrenal cortex and hypothalamus. Previous studies found that ouabain potently inhibited inflammatory reactions and regulated immunological processes. Our present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic role of ouabain on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice. MATERIAL AND METHODS Ouabain (0.1 mg/kg) or vehicles were intraperitoneally injected into male C57BL/6J mice once a day for 3 consecutive days. One hour after the last injection of ouabain, LPS (5 mg/kg) was administrated through intranasal instillation to induce ALI. 6 hours and 24 hours later, bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid (BALF) and lung tissues were harvested to detect the protective effects of ouabain, including protein concentration, inflammation cell counts, lung wet-to-dry ratio, and lung damage. RESULTS The results showed that ouabain attenuated LPS-induced ALI in mice, which was indicated by alleviated pathological changes, downregulated TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 production, inhibited neutrophils infiltration and macrophages, and ameliorated pulmonary edema and permeability. Further results found the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways were suppressed by ouabain in LPS-induced ALI. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that ouabain negatively modulates the severity of LPS-induced ALI."
29953423," Kidney transplantation from hepatitis C seropositive (HCV+) donors may benefit hepatitis C RNA-positive (RNA+) candidates, but it is unclear how the willingness to be listed for and accept such kidneys affects waitlist and transplant outcomes. In a single-center retrospective analysis, HCV+ transplant candidates (N = 169) listed from March 2004 to February 2015 were evaluated. All RNA+ candidates were offered the option to be listed for HCV+ donors. RNA- candidates were listed only for HCV- donors. Fifty-seven patients (51% of all RNA+ transplant candidates) willing to accept HCV+ donors were listed for both HCV+ and HCV- donor kidneys. During 6-year follow up, 43 (75%) of 57 patients accepting HCV+ versus 19 (35%) of 55 patients not accepting HCV+ received a deceased donor kidney transplant (P < 0.0001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that willingness to be listed for and accept HCV+ kidneys was associated with receiving deceased donor kidney transplant (P = 0.0016). Fewer patients accepting HCV+ donors (7 [12%] vs 16 [29%]) were removed from the list due to death or deteriorated medical condition (P = 0.0117). Posttransplant patient and graft survival rates were not significantly different. Overall patient survival since the listing (combined waitlist and posttransplant survival) was similar among the groups. HCV RNA+ candidates had better access to transplantation and similar overall survival before the era of widespread use of direct-acting anti-HCV agents."
29953422," Native nephrectomy in pediatric kidney transplant recipients is performed for multiple indications. Posttransplant hypertension requiring medical management is common, and the effect of native nephrectomy on posttransplant hypertension is poorly studied. Our aim is to evaluate the impact of native nephrectomy on posttransplant hypertension. One hundred thirty-six consecutive pediatric kidney transplant recipients from 2007 to 2012 were studied at a single institution and divided into 2 groups: no nephrectomy and native nephrectomy (unilateral and bilateral nephrectomy). Antihypertensive medication use was evaluated before nephrectomy/transplant, at discharge from transplant and at 1, 3, and 5 years posttransplant. In a bivariate analysis, nephrectomy was associated with a significant reduction in the percentage of patients requiring antihypertensive medication at the time of discharge (27.3%) and 1 year posttransplant (10.7%) as compared with patients without nephrectomy (71.7%, and 50%, respectively, P < 0.05). This trend toward reduction in antihypertensive medication in the nephrectomy group as compared with the no nephrectomy group persisted at 3 (18.6% versus 43.2%) and 5 years (19.7% versus 37.5%) posttransplant. Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that patients without native nephrectomy had higher odds of requiring antihypertensive medication at the time of discharge (3.3) and 1 year (5.2) as compared with patients who underwent native nephrectomy (P = 0.036 and P = 0.013, respectively). Native nephrectomy reduces the odds of needing antihypertensive medication after transplant. The impact of native nephrectomy is crucial to the comprehensive management of pediatric transplant recipients where medication compliance is challenging and lifelong hypertension is known to negatively impact cardiovascular health."
29953421," Persistent hepatitis E virus genotype 3 (HEV G3) infections affect solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, but the burden in these cohorts in the United Kingdom is unknown. We established an audit to determine the point prevalence of HEV viremia in SOT and HSCT patients in the United Kingdom and compare different testing approaches to inform screening strategies. Between January 5, 2016, and September 21, 2016, 3044 patients undergoing therapeutic drug monitoring at a single transplant center were screened for HEV ribonucleic acid (RNA) in minipools. A total of 2822 patients who could be characterized included 2419 SOT patients, 144 HSCT patients and 259 patients with no available transplant history. HEV RNA-positive samples were characterized by serology and genomic phylogeny. HEV antigen (HEV-Ag) testing was performed on RNA-positive samples, 420 RNA-negative samples and 176 RNA-negative blood donor samples. Nineteen of 2822 patients were viremic with G3 HEV giving a prevalence of 0.67%. The median alanine aminotransferase was significantly higher in the HEV viremic patients (P < 0.0001); however, 2 viremic patients had an alanine aminotransferase value within the normal range at the time of screening. The HEV-Ag assay identified 18/19 viremic patients and all those patients with proven viremia longer than 4 weeks. Transplant recipients in the United Kingdom are at a low but significant risk of HEV infection. HEV-Ag detection could be an alternative to RNA detection where the goal is to identify established persistent HEV infection, particularly where expertise, facilities, or cost prohibit RNA testing."
29953420," Injured warfighters air evacuated to tertiary medical care facilities are subjected to many stresses that may promote the development of sepsis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to ""in-flight"" hypobaria and/or hyperoxia within 24 hours after onset of intra-abdominal infection in rats accelerates the development and/or severity of sepsis and neurologic injury in survivors. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent cecal ligation/puncture (CLP) or sham procedures. Twenty-four hours later, rats were then placed in hypobaric chambers for 6 hours and assigned to normobaric conditions and maintained at either 21% or 100% O2, or under hypobaric conditions (pressure equivalent to an altitude of 8,000 ft) but maintained under either 28% or 100% O2. Two days after CLP or sham, blood samples were obtained for cytokine levels, and mitochondria were isolated from the brain and heart of a subset of animals for analysis of mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Animals were also evaluated for neuromotor impairment before and 15 days postsurgery. Among the 70 rats studied, 16.7% of CLP but none of the sham-treated rats died. All of the CLP but none of the sham rats had evidence of peritonitis at 2 days. Twenty percent (6 of 30) CLP rats undergoing hypobaria versus 12.5% (3 of 24) of CLP rats exposed to normobaria died (p = 0.715) while 12% (3 of 25) of CLP rats exposed to hyperoxia versus 20.7% (6 of 29) of CLP rats exposed to normoxia died (p = 0.48). The ratio of mitochondrial ATP-generating O2 consumption to resting respiration was higher in the CLP plus hypobaria under 100% compared with shams. The only difference in H2O2 production was observed in mitochondria from CLP rats exposed to hyperoxia under normobaric conditions. Composite neurologic scores obtained 15 days postinjury were lower than those at baseline for shams. We conclude that neither ""in-flight"" hyperoxia nor hypobaria exacerbate sepsis or neurologic injury."
29953418," Facial photoaging has become a major cosmetic concern, and the microneedle fractional radiofrequency system (MFRS) is a novel method for rejuvenation that combines radiofrequency and microneedles. This study prospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of an MFRS in the treatment of facial photoaged skin in Chinese patients. Twenty-seven patients with moderate facial photoaging were recruited and received 3 treatments at 4-week intervals. Blinded clinical assessment was performed by 2 independent dermatologists on a 5-point global photoaging scale (GPS). Patients were also questioned on the extent of improvement of rhytides, skin tightening, and complexion with a 4-point global aesthetic improvement scale (GAIS) and satisfaction based on a 5-point scale. Adverse events and pain scores were also evaluated. Compared with the baseline, there was a significant improvement in facial photoaged skin after 3 treatments, and these positive outcomes were maintained up to the 6-month follow-up, according to the GPS and GAIS scores. Most patients were satisfied with the treatment and reported mild to moderate pain and adverse effects. This MFRS is effective for facial skin rejuvenation in Chinese patients. The therapy also seems safe and well tolerated."
29953417," The microbiome is defined as the collective genomes of the microbes (composed of bacteria, bacteriophage, fungi, protozoa and viruses) that colonize the human body, and alterations have been associated with a number of disease states. Changes in gut commensals can influence the neurologic system via the brain-gut axis, and systemic insults such as trauma or traumatic brain injury (TBI) may alter the gut microbiome. The objective of this study was to evaluate the gut microbiome in a pre-clinical TBI cortical impact model. Male rats underwent craniotomy and randomized to a sham group (n = 4), or a moderate TBI (n = 10) using a pneumatic impactor. MRI and behavioral assessments were performed pre-TBI and on days 2, 7 and 14 days thereafter. Microbiome composition was determined with 16 s rRNA sequencing from fecal sample DNA pre-TBI and 2 hrs, 1, 3, and 7 days afterwards. Alpha- and β- bacterial diversity, as well as organizational taxonomic units (OTUs) were determined. Significant changes in the gut microbiome were evident as early as 2 hrs after TBI as compared to pre-injured samples and sham rats. While there were varying trends among the phylogenetic families across time, some changes persisted through 7 days in the absence of therapeutic intervention. While large structural lesions and behavioral deficits were apparent post-TBI, there were modest but significant decreases in α-diversity. Moreover, both changes in representative phyla and α-diversity measures were significantly correlated with MRI-determined lesion volume. These results suggest that changes in the microbiome may represent a novel biomarker to stage TBI severity and predict functional outcome."
29953416," Cancer cell dependence on activated oncogenes is targeted therapeutically, but acquired resistance is virtually unavoidable. Here we show that the treatment of addicted melanoma cells with BRAF-inhibitors, and of breast cancer cells with HER2-targeted drugs, led to an adaptive rise in Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) expression, which is crucial for the onset of acquired resistance to therapy. Moreover, NRP1 levels dictated the efficacy of MET oncogene-inhibitors in addicted stomach and lung carcinoma cells. Mechanistically, NRP1 induced a JNK-dependent signaling cascade leading to the upregulation of alternative effector kinases, EGFR or IGF1R, which in turn sustained cancer cell growth and mediated acquired resistance to BRAF, HER2, or MET inhibitors. Notably, the combination with NRP1-interfering molecules improved the efficacy of oncogene-targeted drugs, and prevented, or even reversed, the onset of resistance in cancer cells and tumor models. Our study provides the rationale for targeting the NRP1-dependent upregulation of tyrosine kinases, responsible for loss of responsiveness to oncogene-targeted therapies."
29953415," The circadian clock is a fundamental and pervasive biological program that coordinates 24-hour rhythms in physiology, metabolism and behaviour, and it is essential to health. Whereas time-of-day adapted therapy is increasingly reported to be highly successful, it needs to be personalized since internal circadian time is different for each individual. In addition, internal time is not a stable trait, but is influenced by many factors including genetic predisposition, age, gender, environmental light levels and season. An easy and convenient diagnostic tool is currently missing. To establish a validated test, we followed a three-stage biomarker development strategy: (i) using circadian transcriptomics of blood monocytes from 12 individuals in a constant routine protocol combined with machine learning approaches, we identified biomarkers for internal time; (ii) these biomarkers were migrated to a clinically relevant gene expression-profiling platform (NanoString), and (iii) externally validated using an independent study with 28 early or late chronotypes. We developed a highly accurate and simple assay (BodyTime) to estimate the internal circadian time in humans from a single blood sample. Our assay needs only a small set of blood-based transcript biomarkers and is as accurate as the current gold standard dim light melatonin onset method at smaller monetary, time and sample number cost. The BodyTime assay provides a new diagnostic tool for personalization of healthcare according to the patient's circadian clock. This study was supported by the Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, Germany (FKZ: 13N13160 and 13N13162) and Intellux GmbH, Germany."

29953412," Background We evaluated the inter-rater agreement between self-assessed Tanner staging and clinical examination and the intra-individual agreement of self-assessed information on various puberty markers in late adolescents from the longitudinal nationwide Puberty Cohort, a sub-cohort of the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC). Methods We invited 715 children from the ongoing Puberty Cohort between June 2016 and January 2017. In total, 366 children (51%) returned an add-on questionnaire identical to the questionnaire used to collect information on puberty markers, including Tanner staging, in the Puberty Cohort. Of these, 197 (54%) also participated in a clinical examination with Tanner staging. We used percentage agreement and weighted kappa statistics to evaluate the inter-rater and intra-individual agreement. Results Due to late entry, more than 75% of children were Tanner stage 4 or above at clinical examination. In girls, the inter-rater agreement for pubic hair and breast staging was 54% and 52%, respectively, yielding weighted kappas of fair strength. In boys, pubic hair and genital staging agreed in 55% and 33%, respectively, corresponding to weighted kappas of fair to moderate strength. Boys tended to underestimate genitalia staging consistently. The intra-individual agreement on Tanner staging was 75-77% in girls and 69% in boys, whereas the intra-individual agreement on axillary hair and acne was above 92%. Conclusions Self-assessment of late stages of pubertal development may be misclassified, leading to random errors in studies of puberty timing. However, self-assessment continues to serve as an important time- and cost-saving tool in large prospective puberty cohorts."
29953411," Background The approach to the clinical management of Graves' disease (GD) is debatable. This study aimed to identify predictors of remission in pediatric GD. Methods A longitudinal study of 36 children and adolescents with GD followed from 1997 to 2017 at a single tertiary hospital was performed. Clinical and biochemical parameters, including comorbidities, treatment with anti-thyroid drugs (ATD) or definitive therapy (radioiodine [RIT] and thyroidectomy), and remission as the main outcome were collected. We performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify likely predictors of remission. Results Among patients, most were female, in late puberty, with exuberant symptoms at onset. Eleven also suffered from Down syndrome (DS). Thirty-four patients (94%) started on methimazole from disease onset, and 25 (69%) received it as the only therapy, with a mean duration of 2.7±1.8 years. Six changed to RIT and three underwent thyroidectomy; no DS patient received definitive therapy. Remission was higher in DS patients (45% vs. 25%, p=0.24), but afterwards (3.9±2.5 vs. 2.3±1.4 years, p<0.05); there was no significance in relapsing (20% vs. 15%). Females were less likely to reach remission (p<0.05); serum free thyroxine at onset was higher (p<0.05) in patients who required definitive therapy. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) values normalized in exclusively ATD therapy, especially from 2 years on (p<0.05). Conclusions Males were more likely to achieve remission. TSI values may normalize in GD, notably from the second year of treatment. DS children may benefit with conservative management in GD."
29953410," Background The present study was designed to determine the value of pre-ablation stimulated thyroglobulin (s-Tg) in predicting distant metastasis (DM) at the time of ablation in children with differentiated thyroid cancer. Methods From August 2009 to December 2016, consecutive children with differentiated thyroid cancer undergoing remnant ablation were retrospectively analyzed. Serum s-Tg was measured with the high-sensitive electrochemiluminescence immunoassay during hypothyroidism at ablation just before the ablative radioactive iodine (131I) administration. Post-ablation, whole body planar scintigraphy was obtained 5 days after administration of ablation activity of 131I. Single photon emission computed tomography/low-dose computed tomography (SPECT/CT) was added for children whose planar findings were inconclusive. Receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was employed to find a cut-off level of pre-ablation s-Tg as a predictor of DM at the time of ablation. Results Fifty-seven children were included for the analysis. Metastases were noticed on post-ablation scintigraphy in 20 (35%) children: five post-operative residual neck lymph node metastases, four post-operative residual neck lymph node and lung metastases, three mediastinal lymph node and lung metastases and eight lung metastases. A significant difference in pre-ablation s-Tg levels was found in children with DM compared with those without DM, 603.5 vs. 5.7 ng/mL, respectively. A pre-ablation s-Tg level of 156 ng/mL was established as the optimal cut-off point to predict DM. Conclusions This study demonstrated that pre-ablation s-Tg could potentially act as a predictor of DM at the time of ablation in children with differentiated thyroid cancer. We also propose a specific pre-ablation s-Tg cut-off value of 156 ng/mL as an optimal threshold for practical use."
29953409," Background Infantile hepatic haemangiomas (IHHs) produce an excess of the thyroid hormone inactivating enzyme type-3 iodothyronine deiodinase (D3), leading to rapid degradation of thyroid hormones and consumptive hypothyroidism. The L-thyroxine replacement dose in patients with consumptive hypothyroidism is inappropriately higher than that in congenital hypothyroidism. Case presentation A 4-month-old boy presented with abdominal distention. Thyroid function tests (TFTs) revealed an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 177 mU/L, normal free thyroxine (fT4) of 1.23 ng/dL, low free tri-iodothyronine (fT3) of 1.55 pg/mL and increased reverse T3 (rT3) of 1240 ng/dL. Abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple IHHs. Based on his TFTs, ultrasonography and MRI evidence, he was diagnosed with consumptive hypothyroidism, and L-thyroxine replacement at 15 μg/kg/day was started. The L-thyroxine dose was increased gradually to 35 μ/kg/day until a stabilising euthyroid status was achieved. By the age of 8 months, the TSH concentration was decreased to normal levels; the L-thyroxine dose was gradually reduced and finally discontinued at the age of 12 months. Repeat abdominal ultrasound and MRI revealed a reduction in the number and size of the haemangiomas. The TFTs were at normal reference levels. The patient remains in active follow-up. Conclusions Neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism is usually negative in cases of IHH, as seen in our case. A high index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose hypothyroidism in cases of IHH. The present case required very high doses of levothyroxine to achieve a euthyroid status. In cases of hypothyroidism in the first year of life with consumptive hypothyroidism caused by hepatic haemangioma, aggressive L-thyroxine replacement is required with no upper limit. The dose should be increased gradually until a stabilising euthyroid status is achieved."
29953408," Background The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between serum total cortisol (TC) and free cortisol (FC) levels in children with septic shock and the relationship of these levels with baseline illness severity. Methods A sub-study of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of hydrocortisone vs. placebo in pediatric septic shock conducted in seven academic pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in Canada on children aged newborn to 17 years. Thirty children with septic shock had serum sent for TC and FC measurement within 6 h of meeting the study eligibility criteria. Results Baseline FC and TC levels were strongly correlated with baseline Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) score (R2=0.759, p<0.001; R2=0.717, p<0.001) and moderately correlated with admission Vasotropic Inotropic Score (VIS) (R2=0.489, p<0.001; R2=0.316, p<0.001). Serum TC levels were highly correlated with FC levels (R2=0.92, p<0.001) and showed strong agreement (R2=0.98, p<0.001 on a Bland-Altman plot). The ratio of FC to TC moderately correlated with TC levels (R2=0.46, p<0.001) but did not correlate with baseline albumin levels (R2=0.19, p=0.13). Conclusions Random TC and FC levels are strongly correlated, show strong agreement and are reflective of illness severity in children with septic shock. As such, isolated FC measurement does not appear to provide added information relative to TC in acutely ill children with septic shock."
29953407," Background Obesity is associated with oxidative stress. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is the first line of defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS), eliminating the strong superoxide radical and producing H2O2, which can then be degraded by catalase (CAT). The main objective of this study was to evaluate the gene expression antioxidant enzymes (Mn-SOD and CAT) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of obese and normal-weight children, and its association with anthropometric and biochemical parameters. Methods Thirty obese and 30 control subjects between the ages of 8 and 16 years were enrolled in this study. Serum insulin levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and insulin resistance was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Biochemical parameters were also measured. PBMCs of the subjects were separated and Mn-SOD and CAT gene expression was measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results Mn-SOD and CAT gene expression was significantly lower in the obese group compared with the control group (p<0.01). Also, a positive correlation was observed between the gene expression of Mn-SOD and CAT and body mass index (BMI), fasting blood sugar, insulin resistance, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) cholesterol, triglycerides (TG) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Conclusions Induction of antioxidants, especially Mn-SOD and CAT, can lead to reduction of oxidative stress and prevent the complications of obesity in children."
29953406," Albeit their practical implications, psychosocial correlates of physical activity and related weight loss in the treatment of extreme obesity have been only sparsely addressed in adults; and even more minimally focused upon in adolescents. This research contrasted results of a 6-month social cognitive theory-based physical activity-support protocol along with standard nutrition counseling in groups of adolescents (n = 19; agemean = 15.4 years) and adults (n = 26, agemean = 44.7 years) with class 3 (extreme) obesity [overall body mass index (BMI)mean = 53.4 kg/m2, standard deviation (SD) = 8.2]. Although baseline total mood disturbance scores were significantly greater in both groups when contrasted with age-corresponding normative values, between-group scores did not significantly differ. BMI and physical activity changes over 3 and 6 months were significantly more favorable in the adult group. There were significant overall improvements in exercise self-efficacy, physical activity self-regulation and total mood disturbance scores, however, the self-efficacy and self-regulation increases were significant in only the adult group. Inverse relationships between changes in physical activity and BMI were stronger in the adult group. Regardless of group, simultaneous entry of changes in exercise self-efficacy, physical activity self-regulation and total mood disturbance scores, over both 3 and 6 months, significantly predicted physical activity changes (R2-values = 0.45-0.75, p-values < 0.001). In each model, self-regulation change was the most salient of those three psychosocial predictors. Although findings suggested that psychosocial correlates of physical activity, leading to weight change, are similar in adolescents and adults with extreme obesity, facilitation of larger effect sizes and/or foci on additional theory-based determinants may be required for clinically meaningful treatment outcomes in adolescents."
29953405," Objective Medical students and professionals report receiving limited education/training related to treating eating disorders. Because medical professionals are the point of initial contact for these patients and are involved necessarily in their treatment, sufficient knowledge on identification and intervention are imperative. This research set out to examine the impact of the eating disorder education and experience offered through a 1-month Adolescent Medicine rotation at a medical university on medical student/resident self-efficacy. Methods The 1-month rotation includes a standardized patient (SP) simulation, 1.5 h of didactic education, and 1 day observing the MD, nutritionist and psychologist within the outpatient Multidisciplinary Child/Adolescent Eating Disorders Clinic. All residents' (n = 132) eating disorder self-efficacy was assessed before (PRE) completing simulation and didactic session and again at the end of the 1-month rotation (END). Self-efficacy was also assessed after simulation and before the didactic session for group 1 (n = 92) and after simulation and didactic session for group 2 (n = 40). Results For group 1, self-efficacy was not significantly impacted PRE to POST. For group 2, self-efficacy significantly improved PRE to POST. POST to END changes were significant for both groups; however, group 2 scored significantly better across all self-efficacy areas at END. Conclusion Resident training in eating disorders requires more than is offered in many residency programs. SP simulation is strengthened as an effective training tool in assessing and promoting resident self-efficacy if it is followed by didactic education. Clinical observation and extended practice that includes ongoing guidance/feedback on performance is recommended in fostering self-efficacy."
29953403," Background Nursing students play a role in promotion of public health as health promoters and professional care providers. Therefore, health-promoting behaviors in nursing students and their self-efficacy for health practices are important in providing better services to patients and clients. With regard to the importance of these factors in the academic progress of students, this study was conducted to examine the level of health-promoting behaviors among nursing students and its relationship with self-efficacy for health practices and academic achievement. Methods This descriptive and correlational study was conducted on 217 nursing students of a large university of medical sciences in the south of Iran in 2016. Data were collected using the Persian version of the health promotion lifestyle profile (HPLP II), self-rated abilities for health practices scale (SRAHPS) and the grade point average of the students (levels A, B, C). Results The mean health-promoting behaviors (2.48 ± 0.35) and self-efficacy for health practices of the students (2.55 ± 0.62) were moderate. The mean score of the students' academic achievement was at level B (16.02 ± 1.85). The health-promoting behaviors were significantly correlated with self-efficacy for health practices (r = 0.623, p < 0.0001) and academic achievement (r = 0.285, p < 0.0001). Moreover, self-efficacy for health practices was significantly correlated with academic achievement (r = 0.282, p < 0.0001). Conclusion The correlation between the health-promoting behaviors and health self-efficacy with academic achievement can be a good basis in devising health and educational programs for students. In planning for promoting academic achievement and health-promoting behaviors of students, it is essential to pay special attention to enhancement of self-efficacy for health practices."
29953402," Background Food addiction (FA) is a controversial concept, denoting the craving for certain foods. Given the little information available, the aim of this study was to evaluate the possible relationships between FA and full-blown and subthreshold psychopathology or eating behaviors in subjects consulting nutritional biologists. Materials and methods Three-hundred and fifty subjects completed the following self-questionnaires: Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS), Structured Clinical Interview for Mood Spectrum, Self-Report, Lifetime Version (MOOD-SR-LT), Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), Structured Clinical Interview for Anorexic-Bulimic Spectrum, Self-Report, Lifetime Version (ABS-SR-LT). Results Most of the subjects were women (n = 278) and the remaining were 72 men. A large proportion of the subjects (77.1%) had a YFAS score <3 and 22.9% ≥3, with no difference between men and women. The YFAS scores ≥3 were significantly and positively related to the all ABS-SR-LT domains, as well as to three dimensions (Depression, Hypomania, Rhythmicity) of the MOOD-SR-LT, and some SCL-90-R domains (Sensitivity, Psychoticism, General Symptom Index and Positive Symptom). Conclusion Our data, while indicating that FA is related to different subthreshold psychopathological domains, in particular, with both depressive and manic symptoms, as well as with rhythmicity of mood spectrum, or with eating subthreshold symptoms, would suggest that it might be a dimension underlying different conditions or symptom clusters."
29953400," Basidiomycetes strains (n = 39) belonging to 9 genera in 8 families are kept in the mycotheca of the Department of Agricultural, Food and Forest Sciences at the University of Palermo (Palermo, Italy). All of the strains are medicinal mushrooms, and some are of great commercial and nutraceutical interest."
29953399," Medicinal mushrooms are used in popular medicine largely as health promoters, mainly because of their antitumor and immunomodulatory activities. Ganoderma lucidum (lingzhi or reishi) and Agaricus brasiliensis are mushrooms that have long been used for medicinal purposes. This study evaluated their immunomodulatory and antitumor effects on mice fed a diet supplemented with G. lucidum and A. brasiliensis mycelia obtained from solid-state fermentation. For 14 weeks the mice were fed chow containing 50% A. brasiliensis and G. lucidum mycelia, using ground wheat as an excipient. The consumption of the supplemented diet inhibited Sarcoma 180 tumor growth and caused important changes in the immune system. The pattern of immune response shifted, increasing CD4+ and CD8+ and decreasing CD19+ cell populations. The restoration of a proper balance between cellular and humoral immunity is an essential process for restraining tumor growth. These results suggest that polysaccharides, such as β-glucans and other mushroom metabolites, possibly promote the T-cell dominance that is imperative to restrain tumor growth."
29953398," Ergothioneine is an effective antioxidant and is abundant in species of genus Pleurotus. This research focused on developing an ergothioneine extract from P. eryngii and P. citrinopileatus under optimal extraction conditions. The hot-water and 70% ethanol extractions yielded more ergothioneine than microwave, ultrasonic, and autoclaving extractions. Hot-water extraction with optimal conditions-125 rpm at 75°C for 5 minutes-produced P. eryngii and P. citrinopileatus extracts with 0.86 and 3.73 mg ergothioneine/g dry weight, respectively. In addition to 50% of added maltodextrin, spray-dried products from mushrooms contained 23.07-16.58% carbohydrates and 18.32-21.40% protein. The microstructure of spray-dried products showed shrunken spheres with mean particle diameters of 15.82-19.94 μm. After in vitro simulated gastric and intestinal digestion, the spray-dried P. eryngii and P. citrinopileatus products contained 88% and 91% residual ergothioneine, respectively. Overall, the spray-dried products could be used as antioxidative supplements."
29953397," Mushroom cultivation has become an important component of agriculture, providing food and contributing to the global economy. It uses vertical space and addresses issues of food quality, health improvement, and environmental sustainability. Auricularia mushrooms are popular ingredients in traditional Chinese cuisine. The objective of this study was to determine yield and evaluate radical scavenging capacity of A. polytricha cultivated on rubberwood sawdust on a large scale; we measured total phenolic content; DPPH, hydroxyl, superoxide anion, and peroxyl radical scavenging; and reducing power. Cultivation on rubberwood sawdust produces an average of 4 harvests per bag and a biological efficiency of 80-82%. The antioxidant capacity investigations revealed that the ethyl acetate fraction was the most potent radical scavenger in all assays except that for superoxide anions, whereas the aqueous fraction exhibited mild to moderate antioxidant capacity in scavenging the various radicals. Artificial cultivation of A. polytricha on rubberwood sawdust yields many sporophores with potent antioxidant capacity."
29953396," Cordyceps sinensis (=Ophiocordyceps sinensis) and Ganoderma lucidum are 2 medicinal mushrooms that have been suggested to have the potential to enhance exercise capacity. We used a commercial supplement combining a traditional Chinese medicine and G. lucidum and tested its effects on human physical, aerobic, and anaerobic capacities. Physical education students (n = 96; 43 women, 53 men; mean ± standard deviation age, 26.3 ± 3.21 years) were randomly divided into 3 groups: low-dose treatment, high-dose treatment, and placebo. Participants received the supplement or the placebo for 28-33 days. Both before and after the intervention, the participants performed a graded maximum oxygen consumption (Vo2max) test on a treadmill and a Wingate anaerobic cycle test (on a different day). The following parameters were measured and recorded during the maximal graded treadmill test: heart rate, oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange ratio, and ventilation. The following parameters were calculated from the Wingate anaerobic cycle test: maximal anaerobic power, mean anaerobic power, and fatigue index. The supplements did not affect Vo2max or the physiological responses upon maximal exercise during the graded treadmill test. In a similar way, they had no effect on peak or mean power, or fatigue index, as measured by the Wingate anaerobic test. A borderline interaction indicated a somewhat lower heart rate at rest after treatment; however, post hoc analysis did not reveal any further statistically significant differences (P = 0.047; F = 3.169). The findings indicate that dual supplementation with C. sinensis and G. lucidum had no effect on Vo2max, on physiological responses at peak exercise load during a graded maximal treadmill test, or on the parameters of anaerobic capacity."
29953395," A novel protease was isolated from Coprinopsis atramentaria, which is, to our knowledge, the first macromolecule to be purified from this species. The protease, referred to as CAP, was purified through the use of ion exchange chromatography on sulphopropyl-sepharose, diethylaminoethyl-cellulose, Q-Sepharose, and gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column. CAP is a monomelic protein with a molecular mass of 32 kDa. The maximum activity of CAP was detected at pH 7.0 and 50°C. The preferred pH of CAP demonstrated that it was a neutral protease. Kinetic constants were determined under optimal reaction conditions, using 1% casein as the substrate. We found Km and Vmax values of 7.98 mg · mL-1 and 215 μg · mL-1 · min-1, respectively. Among the various metal ions tested, Pb2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Hg2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ exerted dose-dependent inhibitory actions, whereas Mg2+ exhibited a promoting action at all concentrations tested. Eight inner peptide sequences were detected by liquid chromatography on an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer and were identified using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, which contains proteases from other sources. Alignment results showed that 2 of them were homologous to fungal cysteine proteases. The other 5 peptide sequences also shared similarities with proteases of other origins. The isolation of a novel protease from C. atramentaria in this study not only expands the sources of proteases but also provides further information about this fungus."
29953394," An 8-week feeding trial was performed to assess the effects of dietary white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) powder (WBMP) on the mucosal immunity and growth of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Trout (n = 192; weight 13.76 ± 1.17 g) were stocked in 12 cages (65 × 65 × 65 cm) placed in 4 raceways with a flow-through water system. Trout were fed a basal diet (control group) or a basal diet supplemented with 0.5%, 1%, or 2% WBMP for 8 weeks. Evaluation of total protein levels and lysozyme activity in skin mucus revealed noticeable increases in trout fed 1% or 2% WBMP (P < 0.05), but no significant difference was observed with 0.5% WBMP administration (P > 0.05). The results of sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed alterations in the protein profile of skin mucus following dietary administration of WBMP. Molecular studies showed a noticeable increase (P < 0.05) in tumor necrosis factor-α messenger RNA in the intestine of WBMP-fed trout, regardless of the inclusion level. Also, fish receiving the 1% or 2% WBMP treatments had a remarkable increase in interleukin (IL)-1β expression compared with the control group (P < 0.05). In a similar way, intestinal IL-8 expression was upregulated with the 1% and 2% WBMP treatments (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference was found between the control group and the 0.5% WBMP treatment group in the case of IL-8 gene expression (P > 0.05). Furthermore, after 8 weeks of WBMP feeding, no improvement was seen in the growth parameters of trout compared with those fish fed the nonsupplemented diet (P > 0.05). These results hint at the potential immunomodulatory effects of dietary WBMP."
29953393," Taiwanofungus camphoratus has been reported to have antitumor effects against various cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the direct inhibitory effect of By-1 (3-isobutyl-l-methoxy-4-[4'-(3-methylbut-2-enyloxy)phenyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione), a compound from spent broth from submerged cultures of T. camphoratus, on human lung adenocarcinoma cells and to determine the molecular mechanism underlying this effect. The growth-inhibitory assay and colony formation assay showed that cell viability was significantly decreased. A By-1 concentration of 300 μmol/L caused 73.55% cell death and at a concentration of 240 μmol/L led to a 58% reduction in the number of colonies. The wound-healing assay showed that the distance of migration was 0.3 times shorter than that of untreated cells. Flow cytometry revealed that By-1 could suppress DNA synthesis, cause cell cycle arrest at the S phase, and induce apoptosis in a reactive oxygen species-dependent manner. Furthermore, the expression of caspase-3 and P53 was 4 times higher than that in untreated cells, and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was decreased 2 times compared with the protein in untreated cells. It is interesting to note that apoptosis and autophagy were both induced during treatment with By-1, and autophagy inhibition decreased cell proliferation. By-1 potently inhibited the growth of SPCA-1 cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The combination of proapoptosis agents and antiautophagy agents could effectively enhance anticancer efficacy, which may be a new strategy in treating non-small cell lung cancer."
29953392," In this investigation we developed an optimal fermentation medium to produce an exopolysaccharide (EPS) with antioxidant activity from Rigidoporus microporus. Lactose and tryptone were chosen as the optimal carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively, for EPS production, with a 6-day cultivation cycle. After removing proteins through the use of the Sevag method, one EPS fraction was purified from the culture filtrates by gel filtration chromatography on a Sepharose CL-6B column. The preliminary chemical structure of the EPS fraction was determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance. The results indicated that the main structure of the EPS consisted of β-glucopyranose and mannopyranose. Furthermore, conformational parameters such as molecular weight (Mw), intrinsic viscosity ([η]), mean-square radii of gyration (Rg), and hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of the EPS were characterized using a size exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering-refractive index viscometry method. It showed that the EPS was a kind of water-soluble polysaccharide with a moderate molecular weight (34.1 × 104) and a flexible, linear random coil chain structure. The antioxidant activity tests suggested that the EPS has great potential application as a natural antioxidant material in foods and medicines."
29953391," T cells produce a wide variety of effector molecules in response to infections, such as cytokines, chemokines, granzymes, and perforins. Because different stimuli promote the production of specific effector molecules, T cell responses come in different flavors. In addition, single-cell analysis of protein production revealed that T cells respond heterogeneously to activation. To unravel the regulatory mechanisms that determine T cell effector function, novel methods were developed that simultaneously measure protein levels with the corresponding mRNA. These flow cytometry-based fluorescence in situ hybridization (Flow-FISH) technologies allow for multiparameter analysis with single-cell resolution of both nucleic acids and proteins. Here, we review the currently available methods of Flow-FISH and describe the possible applications thereof, with a specific focus on T cells."
29953390," Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells equipped with the ability to rapidly kill stressed cells that are neoplastic or virally infected. These cells are especially important in settings where these stressed cells downregulate MHC class I molecules and evade recognition by cytotoxic T cells. However, the activity of NK cells alone is often suboptimal to fully control tumor growth or to clear viral infections. Thus, the enhancement of NK cell function is necessary to fully harness their antitumor or antiviral potential. In this review, we discuss how NK cell function can be augmented by the modulation of signal transduction pathways, by the manipulation of inhibitory/activating receptors on NK cells, and by cytokine-induced activation. We also discuss how some of these strategies are currently impacting NK cells in the treatment of cancer and infections."
29953389," Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells have emerged as a major component of T cell biology. Recent investigations have greatly advanced our understanding of TRMs. Common features have been discovered to distinguish memory T cells residing in various mucosal and non-mucosal tissues from their circulating counterparts. Given that most organs and tissues contain a unique microenvironment, local signal-induced tissue-specific features are tightly associated with the differentiation, homeostasis, and protective functions of TRMs. Here, we discuss recent advances in the TRM field with a special emphasis on the interaction between local signals and TRMs in the context of individual tissue environment."
29953371," The use of radiation is an essential part of both modern cancer diagnostic assessment and treatment. Next-generation imaging devices create 3D visualizations, allowing for better diagnoses and improved planning of precision treatment. This is particularly important for primary brain cancers such as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma or the most common primary brain tumor, glioblastoma, because radiotherapy is often the only treatment modality that offers a significant improvement in survival and quality of life. In this review, we give an overview of the different imaging techniques and the historic role of radiotherapy and its place in modern cancer therapy. Finally, we discuss three key areas of risks associated with the use of ionizing radiation: (1) brain tumor induction mainly as a consequence of the diagnostic use of radiation; (2) cognitive decline as a consequence of treating childhood brain tumors as an example of long term consequences often neglected in favor of highlighting secondary primary cancers; and (3) pro-proliferative and pro-invasive alterations that occur in tumor cells that survive radiotherapy. Throughout the discussion, we highlight areas of potential future research."
29953370," Radiation therapy has been a cornerstone of cancer management for many decades and is an integral part of the multi-modality care of patients with brain tumors. The known serious side effects of radiation therapy on the head or central nervous system are uncommon and include radiation necrosis, microangiopathy, and progressive leukencephalopathy. In addition, there have been descriptions of radiation-induced tumors including sarcomas, gliomas, lymphomas, and carcinomas of the thyroid. Patients who have received radiation therapy of the head or face may rarely develop radiation-induced tumors, a majority of which are meningiomas, followed by radiation-induced gliomas (RIGs) and sarcomas. The increased risk of RIGs is well described in both the pediatric and adult populations and after the use of both therapeutic and diagnostic radiations. The incidence of RIGs is estimated at approximately 0.5-2.7% at a latent period of approximately 15 years. The risk appears to be dependent on patient age at treatment, as well as radiation dose and treatment volume considerations. The scope of this review focuses on the etiology, clinical features, and management of RIGs as they relate to previous radiation therapy."
29953369," Although modern radiation therapy delivers a localized distribution of ionizing energy that can be used to cure primary cancers for many patients, the inevitable radiation exposure to non-targeted normal tissue leads to a risk of a radiation-related new cancer. Modern therapies often produce a complex spectrum of secondary particles, both charged and uncharged, that must be considered both in their physical radiation transport throughout the patient and their potential to induce biological damage, which depends on the microscopic energy deposition from the cascade of primary, secondary, and downstream particles. This work summarizes the experimental data for relative biological effectiveness for particles associated with modern radiotherapy in light of their capacity to induce secondary malignancies in patients. A distinction is highlighted between the radiobiological experimental data and the coarser metrics used frequently in radiation protection. For critical assessment of the risks of secondary malignancies for patients undergoing radiation therapy, a detailed description of primary and secondary radiation fields is needed, though not routinely considered for individual patient treatments. Furthermore, not only the particle type, but also the microscopic dose and track structure, must be considered, which points to a demand for detailed physics models and high-performance computing strategies to model the risks."
29953368," Radiation therapy remains one of the most effective cancer treatments. Nevertheless, biology-driven personalized radiation therapy that enables treatment according to the biological characteristics of the individual tumors and normal tissues still needs to be implemented in the clinic. Understanding the mechanisms of radiation response in both tumors and normal tissues is necessary to develop reliable predictive biomarkers for tumor radioresistance and normal tissue toxicity as well as to exploit new therapeutic opportunities for tumor radiosensitization. In this article, we review the mechanisms of tumor radiosensitivity as well as the early and late responses of normal tissues to therapeutic radiation exposure. We also discuss the possible implementation of these mechanisms for biology-driven personalized radiation treatment."
29953367," Radiation therapy (RT) is commonly used for the treatment of localized prostate cancer (PCa). However, cancer cells often develop resistance to radiation through unknown mechanisms and pose an intractable challenge. Radiation resistance is highly unpredictable, rendering the treatment less effective in many patients and frequently causing metastasis and cancer recurrence. Understanding the molecular events that cause radioresistance in PCa will enable us to develop adjuvant treatments for enhancing the efficacy of RT. Radioresistant PCa depends on the elevated DNA repair system and the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to proliferate, self-renew, and scavenge anti-cancer regimens, whereas the elevated heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) enable radioresistant PCa cells to metastasize after exposure to radiation. The up-regulation of the DNA repairing system, ROS, HSP90, and EMT effectors has been studied extensively, but not targeted by adjuvant therapy of radioresistant PCa. Here, we emphasize the effects of ionizing radiation and the mechanisms driving the emergence of radioresistant PCa. We also address the markers of radioresistance, the gene signatures for the predictive response to radiotherapy, and novel therapeutic platforms for targeting radioresistant PCa. This review provides significant insights into enhancing the current knowledge and the understanding toward optimization of these markers for the treatment of radioresistant PCa."
29953366," Currently, more than half of newly diagnosed cancer patients receive radiation treatment. However, the radioresistance of tumor cells as well as the early and late side effects limit the beneficial outcome of radiotherapy. Accordingly, the innovative approaches to maximize tumor killing and/or minimize radiation toxicity remain a major focus of interest. In the past decade, several pieces of evidence have shown the importance of different modes of regulated cell death (RCD) in the radioresponse of malignant and normal tissues. Furthermore, the biological modulation of radiation-induced RCDs has come to attention as a novel therapeutic means. Here, we review the major signaling pathways that orchestrate all types of RCD initiated by exposure to ionizing radiation. The latest advances in the development of small-molecule RCD modulators (both natural and synthetic) that are intended for widening the therapeutic window of radiotherapy are also discussed."
29953365," Ionizing radiation is a valuable tool in many spheres of human life. At the same time, it is a genotoxic agent with a well-established carcinogenic potential. Progress achieved in the last two decades has demonstrated convincingly that ionizing radiation can also target the cellular epigenome. Epigenetics is defined as heritable changes in the expression of genes that are not due to alterations of DNA sequence but consist of specific covalent modifications of chromatin components, such as methylation of DNA, histone modifications, and control performed by non-coding RNAs. Accumulating evidence suggests that DNA methylation, a key epigenetic mechanism involved in the control of expression of genetic information, may serve as one of the driving mechanisms of radiation-induced carcinogenesis. Here, we review the literature on the effects of ionizing radiation on DNA methylation in various biological systems, discuss the role of DNA methylation in radiation carcinogenesis, and provide our opinion on the potential utilization of this knowledge in radiation oncology."
29953364," Solid-state fermentation (SSF) with the medicinal higher Basidiomycete Ganoderma lucidum was studied as a strategy to use pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) and poplar (Populus nigra L.) wood chips and sawdust. Fruiting bodies were produced and the value of the biotransformed substrate was assessed. The highest mushroom yield (63 g dry weight per kilogram of dry substrate) was obtained with poplar sawdust and wood chips. Immersion of the bioreactors was a simple watering method that obtained suitable yields. Two morphological types were induced using 2 different incandescent light intensities. High light irradiation induced the highest valued mushroom morphology (as a whole product). Time course study of substrate biodegradation and mycelial growth dynamics indicated that the trophophase lasted 20 days and presented laccase activity of 0.01-0.03 units · g-1. The activity at idiophase was 10 times higher. Aqueous and alkali extracts, as well as carbohydrase enzyme profile activity, revealed differences in the properties of the residual substrate; some related to the substrate source are considered to be of concern for further use of this pretreated biomass. In view of the results obtained, we propose use of SSF of pine and poplar with G. lucidum to profitably recycle softwood by-products from the timber industry."
29953363," Hericium erinaceus is an edible and medicinal mushroom with potential neuroprotective effects. The study of H. erinaceus has attracted considerable attention during the past 10 years, particularly with regard to its potential utility in the treatment of motor dysfunction, Alzheimer disease, and other forms of dementia. We previously determined that oral supplementation with H. erinaceus results in significant improvements in novelty-seeking behavior and novel object recognition in mice. In this study, H. erinaceus was added to the diets of wild-type mice for 2 months, and effects on spatial memory were evaluated by means of a Y maze and an object location task. We found that H. erinaceus increased general locomotor activity but had no effect on spatial memory. Thus, oral supplementation with H. erinaceus yields specific and selective improvements in recognition memory without altering spatial working memory, which supports the hypothesis that recognition memory can be modeled as a dual process. In this model, the perirhinal cortex supports the recognition of individual items as part of a circuit involved in familiarity with an encountered stimulus, whereas the hippocampus supports recollected associations and relationships between stimuli."
29953362," Eleven strains of an entomopathogenic fungus, isolated and identified as Ophiocordyceps sobolifera, were screened for activity against 5 strains of Gram-negative and 5 strains of Gram-positive bacteria. Four of the isolates, Cod-KK1634, Cod-KK1643, Cod-KS1601, and Cod-SN1626, had activity against the test strains of Grampositive bacteria. Of these 4 extracts, the Cod-KK1643 extract had the lowest minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations. The Cod-KK1643 extract exhibited both concentration- and time-dependent bactericidal activity. Moreover, the Cod-KK1643 extract induced morphological alterations in bacterial cells, including decreased cell size, a crushed appearance, and cell lysis. It is surprising to note that the extracts also inhibited MCF-7 cell proliferation, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 47.09 ± 33.64 mg/mL after 72 hours. The extracts also inhibited MCF-7 cell migration, with the lowest percentage of relative closure achieved with Cod-KK1643. These findings represent what is to our knowledge the first information on the activities of O. sobolifera mycelial extracts against bacteria and the human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line."
29953361," A cultivar of fruiting bodies of Ophiocordyceps sinensis (FBOS; OCS02) was analyzed for nutrients, bioactive compounds, and heavy metal content to showcase its potential as a competitive, sustainable, and safe alternative to wild types and other cultivars. A previous 28-day subacute toxicity study showed that doses up to 1 g · kg-1 did not cause any adverse effects in Sprague-Dawley rats. The OCS02 cultivar contained large amounts of cordycepin, polysaccharides, and essential and semi-essential amino acids (0.66, 482.80, 99.02, and 101.04 g · kg-1, respectively) compared with levels reported in wild types and in cultivated mycelia. β-1,3/1,6-glucan content was considerably high at 342.50 g · kg-1. The potassium level (5.14 g kg-1) tied in well with the low sodium content (0.121 g · kg-1)-6 times lower than amounts in wild types. We found no detectable levels of heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, cadmium, and mercury. The major amino acids found in FBOS (0CS02 cultivar) were arginine, lysine, serine, and threonine at 45.20, 20.30, 18.60, and 18.20 g · kg-1, respectively. The cultivated FBOS (OCS02 cultivar) is a comparable alternative to wild-type and other cultivated strains of O. sinensis. It has potential as a nutraceutical to meet market demand."
29953360," Increasing yield is a principal goal when breeding Lentinus edodes. The detection of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying yield and its related traits, precocity and the number of fruiting bodies (NFs), is important in order to breed high-yield cultivars. Using composite interval mapping (CIM), we mapped a total of 25 QTLs responsible for precocity, NFs, and yield in 2 segregating populations of L. edodes. QTLs for the 3 traits were mapped on 5 different linkage groups, contributing 5.9% to 15.4% of the phenotypic variation. Colocated QTLs were also found underlying multiple traits, implying the presence of a genic pleiotropic effect or tightly linked genes. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of the genetic dissection of precocity, NFs, and yield using QTL mapping in L. edodes. Findings of this study will facilitate marker-assisted breeding of high-yield cultivars of L. edodes."
29953359," The gucchi mushroom, Morchella esculenta, commonly known as the morel, is called thunthoo in the Bhaderwahi dialect spoken in District Doda of Jammu and Kashmir, India, and is an expensive food item that grows wild and is collected manually. Its nutritive and medicinal values are acknowledged. The farming community in the district traditionally collects the mushroom from forested areas through a well-managed community approach. Elders of families and communities have taught farmers how to identify the mushroom, recognize distribution patterns, and collect it. The knowledge and ability to differentiate M. esculenta from other poisonous wild mushrooms has also been inherited from the elders and community members. Women and children collect it from the outskirts of the forested areas and villages; men penetrate deeper into the dense forests in groups. It is either sold fresh to local shopkeepers or dried at home; the majority of gucchi collectors do the latter. Traditionally, the mushrooms are most commonly dried in the sun or the kitchen. The mushroom fetches a remunerative price and supplements the household incomes of the rural folk who collect it. Marketing gucchi has not been reported as a constraint. It has traditionally been used to overcome gastric problems and indigestion, as a tonic, to help heal wounds, and to reduce joint pain. Its medicinal uses are, however, restricted to only the hills and far-flung areas."
29953358," Ganoderma lucidum is known to exert many health benefits including effects to improve oxygen utilization. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the role of a hydroalcoholic G. lucidum extract in providing tolerance to HT22 cells grown under hypoxic conditions. HT22 cells were exposed to 0.5% O2 in the presence or absence of the extract for 24 hours. At the end of the exposure period, we performed cell viability assays, cell cycle analysis, and biochemical and protein expression studies. The extract-treated cells revealed less cell death, minimized caspase 3 and reactive oxygen species levels, and relieved G0/G1 cell cycle arrest compared with hypoxic cells cultured without the extract. Further, extract-treated cells showed improved expression of Nrf2, heme oxygenase 1, and metallothionein and stabilized levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α. Moreover, lower levels of nuclear factor-κB and tumor necrosis factor a were evident in extract-treated cells. Overall, the G. lucidum extract reduced hypoxia-induced cell death and augmented transcription factors (HIF-1α and Nrf2), conferring tolerance to hypoxia."
29953357," Chronic kidney disease is a health burden worldwide but particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, with dwindling resources as a result of poor commodity export, devaluation of currencies, and corruption that had decreased the average family income and substantially increased the number of persons living on less than $1.90/day. Natural products are part of the healthcare delivery system in that part of the world. This study was conducted to evaluate the protective effects of Pleurotus tuber-regium on the kidneys of rats treated with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) for 13 weeks. Sixty rats were divided into 6 groups, with 10 animals in each group. Group I (control) received olive oil (3 mL/kg) intraperitoneally twice weekly and were given feed and water ad libitum. Group II received CCl4 (3 mL/kg, 30% in olive oil) twice weekly. Groups III, IV, and V received 100, 200, and 500 mg/kg wild edible P. tuber-regium (33.3% in feed) daily, respectively, in addition to 3 mL/kg CCl4 twice weekly. Group VI received 500 mg/kg P. tuber-regium (33.3% in feed) daily. At the end of 13 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and kidney weights recorded. Serum concentrations of creatinine, urea, and fasting blood glucose were assayed. Malondialdehyde, ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol, superoxide dismutase, catalase, total glutathione, and peroxidase were measured in kidney homogenate. The kidneys were also histologically examined. Administration of CCl4 to rats significantly (P < 0.05) increased the absolute and relative kidney weights from 0.93 ± 0.04 and 0.38 ± 0.02 g in the control group to 1.30 ± 0.04 and 0.58 ± 0.02 g in the treated groups (Groups III, IV, and V), respectively. CCl4 administration increased the concentrations of creatinine, urea, fasting blood glucose, and malondialdehyde from 0.53 ± 0.05 mg/dL, 17.0 ± 1.10 mg/dL, 72 ± 2.80 mg/dL, and 1.40 ± 0.32 μmol/L in the control group to 0.84 ± 0.03 mg/dL, 43.0 ± 6.90 mg/dL, 77 ± 2.2 mg/dL, and 14.0 ± 3.5 μmol/L in the treated groups, respectively. The concentrations of ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol, superoxide dismutase, catalase, total glutathione, and peroxidase decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from 0.41 ± 0.02 mg/dL, 5.15 ± 0.21 μg/mL, 8.49 ± 0.38 units/mL, 75.20 ± 4.57 mU/mL, 1.62 ± 0.03 μg/mL, and 9.74 ± 0.40 mU/mL in the control group to 0.24 ± 0.03 mg/dL, 1.80 ± 0.11 μg/mL, 2.78 ± 0.30 units/mL, 31.9 ± 5.87 mU/mL, 0.36 ± 0.04 μg/mL, and 3.84 ± 0.22 mU/mL in the treated groups, respectively. Photomicrographs showed that P. tuber-regium prevented the fibrosis and tubular and Bowman capsule distortions observed in the CCl4-only group. P. tuber-regium is effective in protecting the kidneys against CCl4-induced damage."
29953356," Mycochemical examination of a methanol extract of Scleroderma bovista Fr. (Agaricomycetes) led to the isolation of 7 compounds, which were, to our knowledge, identified for the first time in this species. The chemical structures of these compounds were determined through extensive spectroscopic methods (nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry). The fungal metabolites were identified as steroids based on ergostane (compounds 1-4) and lanostane (compounds 6 and 7) skeletons, whereas compound 5 was a ceramide derivative. We evaluated the antiproliferative activity of compounds 4-7 against human cancer cell lines (HeLa, A2780, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7) using the MTT assay. The lanostane-type derivatives (compounds 6 and 7) and ergosterol peroxide 3-glucoside (compound 4) exerted significant antiproliferative property on 1 or more human cancer cell lines."
29953355," This research studies the influence of substrate on the antioxidant activity of alcohol extracts of Paecilomyces hepiali. We used corn, rice, millet, and peas as substrates. Antioxidant activity was measured with the DPPH radical scavenging method. Concentrations of extracts (6.25, 3.12, 1.56, 0.78, and 0.39 mg/mL) were applied in all evaluations. Overall antioxidant activity was expressed as the concentration of substrate that decreased DPPH radical levels by 50% (IC50DPPH) for 7 methanol and 7 ethanol extracts. A comparison of IC50DPPH allowed us to conclude that the methanol extracts are more active in scavenging stable DPPH radicals than are the ethanol extracts. The substrate with antioxidant properties most suitable for cultivation of P. hepiali was rice supplemented with non-defatted soy flour. The extract most effective in scavenging stable radicals was the methanol extract of sample 4 (IC50DPPH = 2.33 mg/mL) cultivated on rice with nondefatted soy flour. The methanol extract of sample 7 cultivated on peas was less effective (IC50DPPH = 11.50 mg/mL). By crystallizing these extracts, we managed to obtain sufficient quantities of 6 samples in a solid state, for which infrared spectra were measured and confirmed the presence of amino acids in the extracts."
29953354," We recently proposed, and successfully applied, a novel and efficient technique-ultrasonic-circulating extraction (UCE) integrating superfine pulverization-to extract and prepare antioxidant crude polysaccharides other natural active substances from Ganoderma lucidum. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities and active ingredients in the powder from UCE (UCEP) through comparison with powder from hot water extraction (HWEP). The DPPH radical, ABTS radical, superoxide anion, total antioxidant activity, and ferric-reducing antioxidant power assay results showed that the UCEP exhibited stronger (P < 0.01) in vitro antioxidant activity than the HWEP. The hepatoprotective activity of the extracts was evaluated against CCl4-induced oxidative damage in the liver. Measurements of reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde in rat liver; measurements of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and lactate dehydrogenase in rat blood; and Western blotting for antioxidant proteins of transforming growth factor-β1, heme-oxygenase 1, and glutathione per-oxidase showed that the UCEP had antioxidant activity in vivo either similar to or slightly stronger than (P < 0.1) the HWEP. Further analysis of the active ingredients revealed that the UCEP and HWEP have similar mean yield and total triterpenoid content, but the former has significantly higher (P < 0.05) mean yield and total polysaccharide content than the latter. Our results suggest that the UCEP displays stronger antioxidant activities because of the larger amount of total polysaccharides; the UCEP may be able to be used as an antioxidant and liver protectant."
29953353," Wild edible mushrooms are one of the most fascinating nutraceuticals because of their pleasant texture, peculiar aroma, and tremendous therapeutic potential; they have been used since ancient times. In this study we evaluated the antioxidant potential of 4 wild edible mushrooms-Cantharellus tropicalis, C. cibarius, Lentinus edodes, and Russula delica-collected from Mizoram, India. We performed in vitro and in vivo studies using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae stress response mechanism as the model system. Among the 4 mushrooms, C. cibarius exhibited the most significant antioxidant activity both in vitro and in vivo, followed by L. edodes, R. delica, and C. tropicalis. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of methanolic extracts of the mushrooms revealed the presence of substantial amounts of fatty acids, fatty acid esters, and other bioactive constituents. The in vitro antioxidant activity was corroborated by in vivo studies using an S. cerevisiae oxidative stress response mechanism. In spot assays, the C. cibarius methanolic extract showed the highest scavenging potential in wild and mutant (sodlΔ and tsalΔ) strains of S. cerevisiae. These results were confirmed further by determining the level of reactive oxygen species through the use of fluorescent microscopy and intensity studies. The results suggested the efficacy of wild edible mushrooms as prominent therapeutic agents and that they have tremendous nutraceutical properties."
29953352," We analyzed intraspecies genetic variability of the medicinal tinder bracket polypore, Fomes fomentarius, from the Asian part of Russia, including the Ural, Altai, Western Sayan, and Baikal regions. We used nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence data as a standard marker for fungal DNA barcoding. In the Asian part of Russia, lineage A occurs as sublineage A2, which differs from sublineage A1 by a single nucleotide insertion at ITS2.3. Sublineage A2 is distributed up to Lake Baikal in the Ural, Altai, and Western Sayan regions. It can be characterized as a Eurasian sublineage of F. fomentarius. Lineage B is also represented by 2 sublineages (B1 and B2), which differ from each other by nucleotide sequences at ITS2.1. Sublineage B1 is represented by a small group of isolates from Asia (Iran, China, Nepal, South Korea), whereas sublineage B2 mainly includes isolates from Europe (Great Britain, Italy, Latvia, Slovakia, Slovenia) and 2 separate samples from Asia (Iran, China); these locales compose the distribution area of F. fomentarius. In the Asian part of Russia, lineage B is represented by sublineage B2 found in the Southern Urals (at the border between Europe and Asia), which is the only area where sublineages A2 and B2 are present. These sublineages are characterized by different substrate spectra: sublineage A2 is predominantly associated with Betula spp. and rarely with Alnus and Larix trees, whereas sublineage B2 does not have a pronounced substrate preference and is found in basidiomes collected from Acer, Duschekia, Prunus, and Salix trees, but not Betula trees. In general, the spectrum of substrates for F. fomentarius lineages A and B in the Asian part of Russia corresponds to that in other parts of this polypore's distribution area. Data are needed on genetic intraspecies variability (polymorphism) in relation to pharmacological properties for further biotechnological cultivation and use of the medicinal fungus F. fomentarius."
29953351," In this study we elucidate antioxidative properties of the mushroom Ganoderma applanatum (Pers.) Pat. enhanced by submerged culture with para-hydroxyphenolic compounds and tea leaf extracts. The tea extract has been shown to increase to different extents the antioxidative efficiency of para-substituted phenolics, with the most profound effect for 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane-1-ol (tyrosol). Within the range of physiological concentrations, the symbatic correlation of the antioxidative action of the fungal samples with the volume of tea extract in the submerged culture medium was observed. We propose an approach to obtain, through the use of black tea extracts as the nutrient medium component, large amounts of G. applanatum seeding mycelia; the extract exerts a profound positive effect on the level of phenolic-type antioxidants."
29953350," Ling zhi-8 (LZ-8) is the first fungal immunomodulatory protein (FIP) isolated from the lingzhi or reishi medicinal mushroom, Ganoderma lucidum. LZ-8 effectively induces interleukin 2 expression and secretion by forming a stable homodimer, and it is regarded as a good candidate to become a new therapeutic agent and/or functional food supplement. However, the molecular mechanism by which LZ-8 dimerization influences the regulation of interleukin 2 is not clear. In this study we performed structure-based multiple alignment of LZ-8 and an FIP from Volvariella volvacea, compared the electrostatic potential of their protein surfaces, and developed a model summarizing the unique electrostatic interaction in LZ-8 dimerization. In addition, further electrostatic potential and virtual amino acid mutation analyses suggested that L10, W12, and D45 are the key amino acid residues responsible for the protein's high immunomodulatory activity. These findings may provide useful insights into the design and construction of a new FIP mutant for use in treating and preventing autoimmune diseases."
29953349," Flammulina velutipes is one of the mushrooms produced most widely in East Asia. In this study we investigated phenotypic variations of 7 agronomic traits in 37 F. velutipes strains from China, and we analyzed their genetic diversity with 70 simple sequence repeat markers. The Shannon information index and gene diversity were 0.894 and 0.478, respectively, demonstrating high genetic variation among the tested strains. Poor genetic variation was found among white strains, in contrast to yellow ones. Analysis of population structure resolved 2 unambiguous genetic groups in the tested F. velutipes strains, with little differentiation between them (FST = 0.016). Yellow cultivars possibly originated from indigenous wild strains in southwest China. Phenotypic correlations were identified among the 7 traits. In particular, stipe length (SL) was significantly positively correlated with yield, indicating that SL could be used as an index for breeding high-yield strains. The 2 genetic groups, and white strains and yellow ones, showed significant differences between SL, yield, and the time interval (days) from mycelial scratch to formation of the first fruiting body. These results indicate that these 3 traits were stratified by population structure. Detection of genetic and phenotypic variations would lay the groundwork for further breeding of elite F. velutipes strains."
29953348," Three new lanostane-type triterpenes (compounds 1-3), 1 new abietane-type diterpene (compound 4), and 10 known compounds (5-14) were isolated from sclerotia of Inonotus obliquus. Their structures were elucidated through a combination of spectrometric techniques, including infrared, 1-dimensional, and 2-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance and high-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry. In in vitro assays, compounds 2 and 4-12 showed hepatoprotective effects against D-galactosamine-induced damage in WB-F344 cells, with inhibitory effects from 35.4% to 83.8%. Compounds 3, 13, and 14 exhibited selective cytotoxicity against Bel-7402, A-549, or KB cell lines. Compounds 13 and 14 showed inhibitory effects against protein tyrosine kinases, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 23.8 and 7.4 μmol/L, respectively."
29953347," Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most fatal solid tumors, resulting in more than 250,000 deaths per year globally. It is the eighth leading cause of death from cancer in men and women throughout the world and is now third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. In addition, the worldwide occurrence of PC ranges from 1 to 10 cases per 100,000 people, indicating a higher incidence in developed countries. Most patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease are not candidates for curative resection due to enormously poor prognosis. Substantial efforts have been taken during the past decade to distinguish better treatments in the absence of efficient screening methods. Regardless of wide-ranging efforts, various systems and therapies have shown insufficient efficacy for PC patients. Therefore, the development of novel drug delivery systems, strategies, and diverse therapeutic approaches to improve the range of active molecules for the treatment of PC is critical. Currently, cancer research focuses on improving the treatment of PC via diverse novel drug delivery systems of chemotherapeutic agents. These novel drug delivery systems consist of nanoparticles and liposomes. Strategies or therapeutic approaches intended for PC include radiation therapy, ablation therapy, and gene therapy. These systems and approaches can carry the drug molecules to targeted cancer cells to enhance the effectiveness of tumor penetration. The present review encloses existing novel drug carrier systems and approaches for PC management."
29953346," DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation exposure is enhanced in the presence of oxygen (the ""oxygen effect""). Despite its practical importance in radiotherapy, the oxygen effect has largely been excluded from models that predict DNA damage from radiation tracks. A Monte Carlo-based algorithm was developed in MATLAB software to predict DNA damage from physical and chemical tracks through a cell nucleus simulated in Geant4-DNA, taking into account the effects of cellular oxygenation (pO"
29953345," Lipids convey both structural and functional properties to eukaryotic membranes. Understanding the basic lipid composition and the dynamics of these important molecules, in the context of cellular membranes, can shed light on signaling, metabolism, trafficking, and even membrane identity. The development of genetically encoded lipid biosensors has allowed for the visualization of specific lipids inside individual, living cells. However, a number of caveats and considerations have emerged with the overexpression of these biosensors. In this Technical Perspective, we provide a current list of available genetically encoded lipid biosensors, together with criteria that determine their veracity. We also provide some suggestions for the optimal utilization of these biosensors when both designing experiments and interpreting results."
29953344," Fluorescence light microscopy is an indispensable approach for the investigation of cell biological mechanisms. With the development of cutting-edge tools such as genetically encoded fluorescent proteins and superresolution methods, light microscopy is more powerful than ever at providing insight into a broad range of phenomena, from bacterial fission to cancer metastasis. However, as with all experimental approaches, care must be taken to ensure reliable and reproducible data collection, analysis, and reporting. Each step of every imaging experiment, from design to execution to communication to data management, should be critically assessed for bias, rigor, and reproducibility. This Perspective provides a basic ""best practices"" guide for designing and executing fluorescence imaging experiments, with the goal of introducing researchers to concepts that will help empower them to acquire images with rigor."
29953343," The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of femtosecond laser irradiation, sandblasting, or acid etching treatments on the surface roughness of ceramic-resin composites and also shear bond strength (SBS) with and without silanization to a resin cement. Samples of Vita Enamic (VE; Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckingen, Germany) and Lava Ultimate (LU; 3M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) were classified into control (no treatment), sandblasting, hydrofluoric acid, and femtosecond laser groups (n=30). Surface roughness was determined using two-dimensional contact profilometry. Surface topography was evaluated using a three-dimensional contact profilometer and a scanning electron microscope. Then groups were divided into two subgroups with similar surface roughness values, including control (C), control + silane (C-S), sandblasting (SB), sandblasting + silane (SB-S), hydrofluoric acid (HF), hydrofluoric acid + silane (HF-S), femtosecond laser (FS), and femtosecond laser + silane (FS-S) groups (n=15). Panavia F 2.0 resin cement was applied to the sample surfaces using an SDI SBS rig (SDI Limited, Bayswater, Australia). The SBS test was performed after water storage (24 h, 37°C) and thermocycles (2000 cycles, 5°C to 55°C), and failure modes were evaluated. The highest surface roughness was observed in the FS group, and the highest SBS was observed in the FS-S group for both VE and LU ( p<0.001). Silanization improved the SBS of VE significantly ( p<0.001) in all surface treatments but did not improve that of LU except in the FS group ( p=0.004). There was a significantly moderate negative correlation in the VE/SB group ( p=0.012) and a moderate positive correlation in the VE/HF group ( p=0.049). Femtosecond laser irradiation was found to be more effective than sandblasting or acid etching in increasing the surface roughness, and it was also the most effective surface treatment with silanization on the SBS of a resin cement to the ceramic-resin composites."
29953342," The purpose of this evaluation was to evaluate the linear coefficient of thermal expansion (LCTE) of 12 conventional glass ionomer (GIC) and four resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI) restorative materials. GIC and RMGI specimens (2 mm × 5 mm × 5 mm) were fabricated (n=12) following manufacturer instructions and were placed in 0.2M phosphate-buffered saline and stored at 37°C and 98% humidity for one week. Specimens had LCTE determined with a thermomechanical analysis (TMA) unit using a 15°C-50°C heating cycle as well as a 50°C-15°C cooling cycle at a 5°C/min rate, using a 3-mm ball-point probe under 0.02 N probe pressure with all specimens kept saturated with PBS using a specially designed quartz container. Each specimen was tested three times, with the mean representing the specimen LCTE. Mean results between specimen heating and cooling were compared with paired Wilcoxon sign rank test, while results between materials were compared with Kruskal-Wallis/Dunn's ( α=0.05). GIC LCTE ranged from approximately 5°C to 20°C ppm °K Under moisture conditions similar to the oral cavity, GIC materials overall had LCTE values closer to that reported for tooth structure. RMGI materials displayed higher values, which was thought to be related to the amount of resin in the matrix. A generally greater LCTE trend with cooling for all materials was noted, but the small magnitude of the difference is presently thought to be of minor clinical significance."
29953341," To evaluate, in vitro, the effect of mouth rinse exposure on bleached enamel. Enamel/dentin bovine blocks (4×4×2 mm) were bleached with 35% hydrogen peroxide (HP) and were submitted to immersion twice daily for 14 days with different rinses (n=10), including those involving: distilled water (C [control]), 225-ppm NaF (FM, Colgate Plax Classic), essential oil (EM, Listerine Tartar Control), 1.5% hydrogen peroxide (HPM, Colgate Plax Whitening), and 2% hydrogen peroxide, pyrophosphates, and 225-ppm NaF (HPM+P, Colgate® Luminous White). The specimens were stored in a remineralizing solution during all experiments. Analyses of color (ΔE, L*, a*, b*) and roughness (Ra) were performed at the baseline, after HP, and after exposure to the rinse. The cross-sectional microhardness (CSMH) and images by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were assessed at the end. The data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) (ΔE), repeated measures ANOVA (Ra), and split-plot ANOVA (CSMH), followed by the Tukey test. The L*, a*, and b* values were analyzed by generalized linear models (α=0.05). Color changes were not statistically different in the groups. Ra increased in all groups after bleaching; however, it was reestablished in C, FM, and HPM+F and increased in EM after 14 days of the rinse. EM and HPM reduced the CSMH values differing from C and promoted alterations on the enamel surface visualized by SEM. The mouth rinses did not affect the whitening efficacy or promote benefits on bleached enamel properties. Moreover, the 1.5% hydrogen peroxide- or essential oil-based mouth rinses affected the bleached enamel properties, promoting an alteration in morphologic surface and mineral loss in depth."
29953340," To evaluate the effect of a remineralizing gel combining fluoride and calcium silicate/phosphate or a sodium fluoride gel on bleached enamel microhardness, color, and wear susceptibility. Two hundred forty bovine enamel-dentin samples were prepared. Baseline analysis of Knoop microhardness, color coordinates (L*a*b*), and surface profile were performed. According to the baseline microhardness values, specimens were stratified into six groups (n=40): NC (negative control)-no treatment; BL (positive control)-bleaching with 40% hydrogen peroxide gel (Opalescence Boost, Ultradent); BL/Rs-bleaching + application of calcium silicate/phosphate gel (Regenerate Serum, Unilever - Rs); Rs/BL-Rs + bleaching; Rs/BL/Rs-Rs + bleaching + Rs; and BL/F-bleaching + 2% sodium fluoride gel. After the treatment described for each group, color change (ΔE) and microhardness were evaluated again. To evaluate abrasion susceptibility, samples were randomly divided into two subgroups, according to the toothpaste used (Cp-Close Up or Rt-Regenerate), and underwent 100,000 brushing strokes. The profile of each sample was evaluated and the mean wear calculated. The data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey tests. All bleached groups showed a significant reduction of microhardness in relation to the negative control. The groups treated with remineralizing gels showed a significantly higher microhardness and less wear than the positive control, although nonsignificant differences were observed among them. Nonsignificant differences in ΔE were found among bleached groups. The groups brushed with Regenerate toothpaste showed significantly less wear than those brushed with Close Up toothpaste. The remineralizing gels did not interfere with bleaching efficacy. However, all the treatments minimized the surface hardness reduction caused by the bleaching procedure and enamel loss after abrasion. Regenerate toothpaste resulted in less enamel abrasion."
29953339," This study compared light transmission through different thicknesses of bulk-fill resin-based composites (RBCs) using a polywave and a single-peak light-emitting diode light-curing unit (LCU). The effect on the surface hardness was also evaluated. Five bulk-fill RBCs were tested. Specimens (n=5) of 1-, 2-, 4-, or 6-mm thickness were photopolymerized for 10 seconds from the top using a polywave (Bluephase Style) or single-peak (Elipar S10) LCU, while a spectrophotometer monitored in real time the transmitted irradiance and radiant exposure reaching the bottom of the specimen. After 24 hours of storage in distilled water at 37°C, the Vickers microhardness (VH) was measured at top and bottom. Results were analyzed using multiple-way analysis of variance, Tukey post hoc tests, and multivariate analysis (α=0.05). The choice of LCU had no significant effect on the total amount of light transmitted through the five bulk-fill RBCs at each thickness. There was a significant decrease in the amount of light transmitted as the thickness increased for all RBCs tested with both LCUs ( p<0.001). Effect of LCU on VH was minimal (η The total amount of light transmitted through the five bulk-fill RBCs was similar at the different thicknesses using either LCU. The polywave LCU used in this study did not enhance the polymerization of the tested bulk-fill RBCs when compared with the single-peak LCU."
29953338," The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of four in-office desensitizing products on dentin tubule occlusion and erosive wear. Dentin hypersensitivity was simulated by EDTA application for five minutes. The specimens were randomly allocated into five groups (n=11), according to treatment: No treatment - Control (C), Duraphat (DUR), Desensibilize Nano P (NP), ClinPro XT Varnish (XTV), and ClinPro White Varnish (CWV). They were then submitted to erosive/abrasive cycling for five days. After EDTA, treatment, and cycling, the specimens were analyzed with an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) to verify the number of opened dentin tubules (ODT) which were counted by using ImageJ software, and with a profilometer to determine the surface curvature/loss. ESEM data were analyzed with two-way repeated measure analysis of variance and Tukey tests. For the profilometer, data were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis, Tukey, and Mann-Whitney tests. After treatment, all groups showed lower ODT than the control, without significant differences between them. After cycling, the only group that showed lower ODT than the control was group XTV; however, it did not significantly differ from the other groups. For the profilometric analysis, there were significant differences in SL between the experimental times after treatment and after cycling for all groups ( p<0.05). After cycling, no surface loss was detected in groups DUR and XTV, which presented a significantly different curvature than group NP and the control group, but not from group CWV. Surface loss was detected for the control and groups NP and CWV, without difference among them. All desensitizing agents tested presented promising results concerning the obliteration of dentin tubules immediately after treatment. XTV was the only desensitizer capable of preventing the reopening of the tubules after the erosive/abrasive challenges. XTV and DUR presented a protective effect against dentin erosive wear."
29953337," The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the application of calcium silicate materials (CSMs), after acid etching, on the longevity of the hybrid layer and marginal adaptation of composite restorations. Eighty human permanent molars received an intrapulpal pressure of 15 cm H Application of CSMs improved the marginal adaptation values in both adhesive groups. In group 1, there were areas of incomplete penetration of resins along with evidence of partial degradation of resin tags. Samples receiving CSM application after acid etching demonstrated long and regular resin tags with very few signs of degradation. Application of CSMs after acid etching can be a potential avenue in preserving the resin-dentin bonds."
29953336," Fractured teeth with both enamel and dentin involvement might be treated with adhesive composite resin restorations. In cases where a perfect color match between the composite restoration and the remaining tooth structure is not achieved, a repair might be carried out to correct the color of restoration. This procedure avoids the restoration replacement, preserving tooth structure without compromising the esthetic outcome."
29953335," This cross-sectional study describes the prevalence and context of violence by sexual partners against female sex workers (FSWs, N = 589) in Andhra Pradesh and its association with alcohol use by FSWs and abusive partners. In all, 84% of FSWs reported alcohol use; 65% reported lifetime physical abuse by a sexual partner. Most abused women suffered abuse from multiple partners, often triggered by inebriation or FSW's defiance. In multivariate logistic regressions, frequency of FSW's alcohol use was associated with abuse by clients and primary partner, whereas partner's alcohol use was only significant for abuse by primary partner, not clients."
29953334," Pantoea ananatis, a cause of center rot of onion, is problematic in the USA and elsewhere. The bacterium lacks disease determinants common to most other bacterial pathogens of plants. A genomic island containing the gene pepM was detected within many onion-pathogenic strains of P. ananatis of diverse origins. The pepM gene of P. ananatis putatively encodes a protein that converts phosphoenolpyruvate to phosphonopyruvate, the first step in the biosynthesis of phosphonates and related molecules. This gene appears to be essential for center rot disease. Deletion of pepM rendered the mutant strain unable to cause lesions in leaves of growing onions and water-soaking of inoculated yellow onion bulbs. Furthermore, growth of the deletion mutant in onion leaves was significantly diminished compared to wild-type bacteria, and the mutant failed to cause cell death in tobacco. Complementation of the mutated strain with pepM restored the phenotype to wild-type capability. The pepM gene is the first pathogenicity gene identified that affects bacterial fitness as well as symptom development in both leaves and bulbs in a pathogen causing center rot of onion."

29953332," People differ in how quickly they learn information and how long they remember it, yet individual differences in learning abilities within healthy adults have been relatively neglected. In two studies, we examined the relation between learning rate and subsequent retention using a new foreign-language paired-associates task (the learning-efficiency task), which was designed to eliminate ceiling effects that often accompany standardized tests of learning and memory in healthy adults. A key finding was that quicker learners were also more durable learners (i.e., exhibited better retention across a delay), despite studying the material for less time. Additionally, measures of learning and memory from this task were reliable in Study 1 ( N = 281) across 30 hr and Study 2 ( N = 92; follow-up n = 46) across 3 years. We conclude that people vary in how efficiently they learn, and we describe a reliable and valid method for assessing learning efficiency within healthy adults."
29953331," The purpose of this white paper is to describe the rehabilitation engineering professions, specifically rehabilitation engineers, rehabilitation technologists/assistive technologists, and rehabilitation technicians. An ad-hoc committee was convened by the Rehabilitation Engineering and Technologists (RE&T) Professional Standards Group (PSG) at the 2013 annual meeting, RESNA Conference in Seattle, Washington. The ad-hoc committee consists of rehabilitation engineering professionals who have experience working in a variety of environments, and with a multitude of professionals. Since the initiation of the ad-hoc committee, versions of this document were published in the Proceedings of the 2014 RESNA Conference and the 2015 RESNA Conference, and feedback has been incorporated into the document from external stakeholders. Furthermore, the white paper was published on the RESNA Website in August of 2015 for public comment. This white paper is the synthesis of the work from the ad-hoc committee, as well as the feedback obtained at the two conference presentations, the public comment period and a review by the RESNA Board of Directors. The white paper is not meant as a systematic review of the literature, nor a formal research process. However, the literature, including gray literature, and expert opinion heavily influenced the development of the white paper.The ad-hoc committee reviewed over 80 different sources in preparing the white paper (see Appendix). The white paper defines the role of rehabilitation engineering professionals based on descriptions found in the literature, and historical experience of stakeholders. Furthermore, it describes the role of rehabilitation engineering professionals in numerous work settings, and describes current and future education and training opportunities. Finally, the white paper provides multiple case studies on the role of rehabilitation engineering professionals in a transdisciplinary assistive technology service delivery process. The white paper is meant as a guide to describe the typical rehabilitation engineering professions in their most generic forms. While there will be exceptions to the rule, the consensus accumulated in this paper and the iterative methods used to aggregate the content, states a majority perspective of current rehabilitation engineering professionals. This document provides a framework for future discussions on the advancement of rehabilitation engineering with the goal of improving the quality of life of individuals with disabilities through the application of science and technology."
29953330," Hammerhead ribozymes are a model system for studying molecular mechanism of RNA catalysis. Physicochemical data-driven mechanistic studies are an indispensable step towards understanding the catalysis of hammerhead ribozymes. Here we characterized a model RNA duplex with catalytically important sheared-type G12-A9 base pair and A9-G10.1 metal ion-binding motif in hammerhead ribozymes. By using high magnetic field NMR, all base proton signals, including catalytic residues, were unambiguously assigned. We further characterized structural features of this RNA molecule and found that it reflects the structural features of the A9-G10.1 motif of hammerhead ribozymes. Therefore, this RNA molecule is suitable for extracting an intrinsic physicochemical properties of catalytically important residues."
29953329," ABO blood group is the most important blood type system for transfusion medicine. A paper-based analytical device (PAD) for ABO blood typing has been proposed. The device was composed of Whatman No. 113 paper, an absorbent gel pad, and a 3D-printing cassette. The 3D-printing cassette contained two circular holes for display of letters ""A"" and ""B"" on the PAD. Whole blood was dropped onto hydrophilic letters A and B on the PAD, in which the anti-A and anti-B were pre-immobilized, respectively. An absorbent gel pad was used to adsorb excess blood sample and washing solution during the washing step. The particle size of agglutinated red blood cells (RBCs) could not be eluted out of the paper by the elution solution. In contrast, non-agglutinated RBCs were washed out by means of elution solution. The devices could be used for real blood samples in a wide range of hematocrit levels, 21-59%. Unknown blood group samples (n = 500) were identified by the developed device and the results were compared with the conventional method, revealing 100% accuracy. Because of its compact size with low-cost fabrication, the portable ABO blood typing device has great potential for point-of-care testing, particularly in developing countries."
29953328," If a radiological incident such as a nuclear power plant accident, a radiological dispersal device, or detonation of an improvised nuclear device occurs, significant areas may be contaminated. Initial cleanup priorities would likely focus on populated areas, leaving the forested areas to pass several seasons where the overhead canopy materials would fall to the forest floor. In the event of a wildfire in a radionuclide-contaminated forest, some radionuclides would be emitted in the air while the rest would remain in the ash. This paper reports on a laboratory simulation study that examines the partitioning of cesium-133 (a non-radioactive isotope of cesium) between airborne particulate matter and residual non-entrained ash when pine needles and peat are doped with cesium. Only 1-2.5 percent of the doped cesium in pine needles was emitted as particulate matter, and most of the cesium was concentrated in the particulate fraction greater than 10 µm in aerodynamic diameter. For peat fires, virtually all of the cesium remained in the ash. The results from this study will be used for modeling efforts to assess potential exposure risks to firefighters and the surrounding public."
29953327," In many clinical studies, Lin's (1989) concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) is a popular measure of agreement for continuous outcomes. Most commonly, it is used under the assumption that data are normally distributed. However, in many practical applications, data are often skewed and/or thick-tailed. King and Chinchilli (2001) proposed robust estimation methods of alternative CCC indices, and we propose an approach that extends the existing methods of robust estimators by focusing on functionals that yield robust L-statistics. We provide two data examples to illustrate the methodology, and we discuss the results of computer simulation studies that evaluate statistical performance."
29953326," Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), the most common cause of acute neuromuscular weakness and paralysis worldwide, encompasses a group of acute immune-mediated disorders restricted to peripheral nerves and roots. Immune-mediated attack of peripheral nervous system myelin, axons or both is presumed to be triggered by molecular mimicry, with both cell- and humoral-dependent mechanisms implicated in disease pathogenesis. Good circumstantial evidence exists for a pathogenic role for molecular mimicry in GBS pathogenesis, especially with its axonal forms, providing insights that could guide future immunotherapy. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PE) are the most commonly prescribed immunotherapies for GBS with variable efficacy dependent on GBS subtype, severity at initial presentation and other clinical and electrophysiologic prognostic factors. The mechanisms of action of IVIg and PE are not known definitely. Despite recent significant advances in molecular biology that provide insights into GBS pathogenesis, no advances in therapeutics or significant improvements in patient outcomes have occurred over the past three decades. We summarize the clinical aspects of GBS, its current pathogenesis and immunotherapy, and highlight the potential of leukocyte trafficking inhibitors as novel disease-specific immunotherapeutic drugs."
29953325," Understanding genetic mechanisms affords the ability to provide causal explanations for genetic phenomena. These mechanisms are difficult to teach and learn. It has been shown that students sometimes conceive of genes as traits or as trait-bearing particles. We termed these ""nonmechanistic"" conceptions of genetic phenomena because they do not allow the space required for a mechanism to exist in the learner's mind. In this study, we investigated how ninth- and 12th-grade students' conceptions of genetic phenomena affect their ability to learn the underlying mechanisms. We found that ninth- and 12th-grade students with nonmechanistic conceptions are less successful at learning the mechanisms leading from gene to trait than students with mechanistic conceptions. Our results suggest that nonmechanistic conceptions of a phenomenon may create a barrier to learning the underlying mechanism. These findings suggest that an initial description of a phenomenon should hint at a mechanism even if the mechanism would be learned only later."
29953324," The benefits of student-centered active-learning approaches are well established, but this evidence has not directly translated into instructors adopting these evidence-based methods in higher education. To date, promoting and sustaining pedagogical change through different initiatives has proven difficult, but research on pedagogical change is advancing. To this end, we examine pedagogical behaviors through a cultural evolutionary model that stresses the global nature of the issue, the generational time that change requires, and complications introduced by academic career trajectories. We first provide an introduction to cultural evolutionary theory before describing our model, which focuses on how cultural transmission processes and selection events at different career phases shape not only who teaches in higher education, but also how they choose to teach. We leverage our model to make suggestions for expediting change in higher education. This includes reforming pedagogy in departments that produce PhD students with the greatest chance of obtaining tenure-track positions."
29953323," This paper attends to challenges for postsecondary science education improvement initiatives, notably understanding and responding to the realities guiding educators' teaching practices. We explored 16 postsecondary biology educators' instructional planning, providing novel insights into why educators select certain strategies over others, including lecturing. Our findings point to an array of factors that educators consider, factors that we believe push against the lecture versus active-learning dichotomy that we hear in some improvement rhetoric. We recommend professional development experiences (including peer evaluations of teaching) wherein educators and other proponents for teaching improvements explicitly explore rationales for teaching, including educators' considerations of the nature of the discipline (content and concepts and skills and processes) and students' needs. Educators with less experience with content were more likely to seek out additional instructional resources during planning, including other educators. Given this, teaching improvement proponents may want to offer professional development activities that sync with periodic and planned teaching assignments that take educators out of their disciplinary knowledge comfort zone. Disciplinary colleagues might serve as exemplars of planning and implementing teaching strategies that both convey foundational content and processes and engage students via evidence-based practices."
29953319," Immunomodulatory monoclonal IgG1 antibodies developed for cancer and autoimmune disease have an inherent risk of systemic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vitro cytokine release assays are currently used to predict cytokine release syndrome (CRS) risk, but the validation of these preclinical tools suffers from the limited number of characterized CRS-inducing IgG1 antibodies and the poor understanding of the mechanisms regulating cytokine release. Here, we incubated human whole blood from naïve healthy volunteers with four monoclonal IgG1 antibodies with different proven or predicted capacity to elicit CRS in clinic and measured cytokine release using a multiplex assay. We found that, in contrast to anti-CD52 antibodies (Campath-1H homolog) that elicited high level of multiple inflammatory cytokines from human blood cells in vitro, other IgG1 antibodies with CRS-inducing potential consistently induced release of a single tested cytokine, interferon (IFN)-γ, with a smaller magnitude than Campath. IFN-γ expression was observed as early as 2-4 h after incubation, mediated by natural killer cells, and dependent upon tumor necrosis factor and FcγRIII. Importantly, the magnitude of the IFN-γ response elicited by IgG1 antibodies with CRS-inducing potential was determined by donor FcγRIIIa-V158F polymorphism. Overall, our results highlight the importance of FcγRIIIa-dependent IFN-γ release in preclinical cytokine release assay for the prediction of CRS risk associated with therapeutic IgG1 antibodies."
29953318," The major limitations of growth curve mixture models for HIV/AIDS data are the usual assumptions of normality and monophasic curves within latent classes. This article addresses these limitations by using non-normal skewed distributions and multiphasic patterns for outcomes of prospective studies. For such outcomes, new skew-t (ST) distributions are proposed for modeling heterogeneous growth trajectories, which exhibit not abrupt but gradual multiphasic changes from a declining trend to an increasing trend over time. We assess these clinically important features of longitudinal HIV/AIDS data using the bent-cable framework within a context of a joint modeling of time-to-event process and response process. A real dataset from an AIDS clinical study is used to illustrate the proposed methods."
29953317," To develop a safe and efficacious heat-stable rotavirus vaccine, new lyophilized formulations were developed using rotavirus serotypes constituting RotaTeq®. A series of formulation compositions, differing in buffering agents, bulking agents, cryoprotectants, amino acids and divalent cations, were screened for their ability to provide stability to rotavirus serotypes during lyophilization and when stored under elevated temperatures for extended periods. Lead formulations and lyophilization cycles were further optimized. Stability profiles of thus optimized formulations showed their ability to retain the potency of rotavirus for > 36 months at 5"
29953316," To investigate the change in nationwide incidence of endophthalmitis following cataract surgery in Korea from 2002 to 2013. From a national sample cohort (n = 1 025 340), cases of postoperative endophthalmitis between 2002 and 2013 were identified. From 70,719 cases of cataract surgery, 49 incidents of endophthalmitis were reported, yielding an incidence of 0.069% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.051-0.092%). Overall, the endophthalmitis incidence decreased from 0.103% in 2002-2005 to 0.045% in 2010-2013, corresponding to an annually decreasing time-trend (0.902, 95% CI, 0.827-0.984). In diabetic patients, however, the incidence was 0.128% and did not change (time trend, 1.015; 95% CI, 0.828-1.245). This study revealed the incidence of endophthalmitis decreased during a 12-year period, but remained constant in diabetic patients."

29953314," Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite of veterinary and human public health importance for which birds act as an intermediate host. No information is available about the epidemiology of T. gondii in wild birds of Pakistan. The present study was designed to determine the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with T. gondii antibodies in wild birds of District Kasur, Punjab Province, Pakistan. A total of 200 wild birds of 28 species were captured from four tehsils (administrative subdistricts of districts) of the district Kasur and their serum samples screened for the presence of T. gondii antibodies using a latex agglutination test (LAT; cut-off value: 1:64). Twenty-five (13%) individual birds and 13 (46%) of the bird species were seropositive for T. gondii antibodies. There were statistical differences in T. gondii prevalence between adults and young (15% and 7%, respectively, P=0.001) and healthy and sick (11% and 50%, respectively, P=0.000) while there were not differences between genders, sites, urbanicity, and tehsils. The present study provides evidence of T. gondii antibodies in wild birds of Pakistan."
29953313," A central goal for reintroduced populations of threatened wood bison ( Bison bison athabascae) is to maintain them free of diseases of concern, particularly bovine tuberculosis (caused by Mycobacterium bovis) and brucellosis (caused by Brucella abortus). A wood bison population in southwestern Yukon, Canada was reintroduced into the wild in 1988, but no health assessment has been done since then. To provide an initial assessment of the health status and, hence, the conservation value of this population, we serologically tested 31 wood bison (approximately 3% of the population) for pathogens of interest and obtained histopathology results for select tissues. We found no evidence of exposure to M. bovis or Brucella spp., but antibodies were present to bovine parainfluenza virus 3, bovine coronavirus, Leptospira interrogans, and Neospora caninum, with seroprevalences of 87, 7, 61, and 7% of the tested animals, respectively. Reintroduced wood bison in southwestern Yukon may be of high value for wood bison recovery because it is a large and geographically isolated population with no bacteriologic, histopathologic, or serologic evidence of exposure to Brucella spp. or M. bovis."
29953312," Cloacal swab samples collected from 538 migratory waterfowl along the Mississippi Migratory Bird flyway in 2013 were tested for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and porcine deltacoronavirus.

29953311," Poxvirus infections have been reported in domestic, captive, and wild avian hosts including many raptor species. A wild Common Buzzard ( Buteo buteo) admitted to a wildlife veterinary clinic in Sardinia, Italy, showed multiple, wart-like proliferative cutaneous lesions on both legs. Histologically, there was ballooning degeneration and large intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies consistent with avipoxvirus (APV) infection. Diagnosis was confirmed by PCR detecting APV genes: P4b (locus fpv167), P35 (locus fpv140), and partial DNA polymerase. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to compare the detected virus with a panel of selected APVs. Analyses of P4b and DNA polymerase assigned the virus to clade A (fowlpox virus, FWPV), subclade A7, grouping with many other APVs previously isolated in birds of prey. Further research should highlight the diversity of avian pox viral strains circulating among common buzzards as well as the phylogenetic role of locus fpv140 (P35) in comparison with the more-conserved P4b and DNA polymerase genes."
29953310," To compare the clinical characteristics of patients with active episodes of ocular toxoplasmosis from three provinces, Misiones, Santa Fe, and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Patients with a diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis from three databases of four tertiary referral uveitis centers were reviewed. Collected data included presentation of the retinochoroiditis, location of the active lesions, associated inflammatory ocular signs and complications. Three hundred thirty-four patients were included in this study. Bilateral involvement of the ocular disease occurred in 26 patients in Misiones (35.14%), 21 patients (12.8%) in Santa Fe, and 9 patients in Buenos Aires (9.4%) (p < 0.001). Extensive retinitis was observed in 49 patients (66.2%) in Misiones, 39 patients (23.8%) in Santa Fe, and 12 patients (12.5%) in Buenos Aires (p < 0.001). The results indicate that there are differences in the clinical characteristics of ocular toxoplasmosis in patients from Misiones, Santa Fe, and Buenos Aires."
29953309," To examine the spectrum of scleritis in four tertiary institutions across the Asia-Pacific. Clinical records from 354 patients were reviewed from centers in Australia, Singapore, and India, excluding those with insufficient data (n = 24). Indian patients presented younger (41.5 ± 13.4 years) than Australians (50.8 ± 17.5) and Singaporeans (48.6 ± 15.9), with fewer women (49% vs 62%/57%). Diffuse disease was universally most common. Autoimmune and infectious disease proportions were similar in Australia (31%/10.3%) and Singapore (27.5%/8.3%) but reversed in India (8.3%/30%). Necrotizing scleritis was most frequently associated with infection (27.3%). Presumed ocular tuberculosis accounted for 75% of infectious cases in India. Posterior scleritis had the highest complication rate (82.4%) and immunosuppressants used per patient (0.98 ± 0.31 95% CI). Clinical presentations of scleritis vary across the Asia-Pacific, particularly in endemic regions for tuberculosis such as India, where it affects younger men with a predominance of nodular and infectious disease."
29953308," To investigate the role of some blood count-derived inflammation biomarkers in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Seventy-nine men with late-stage AMD and 79 male age-matched cataract controls without AMD were recruited in March-December, 2016. A blood sample was taken. The following blood cell count-derived indexes were evaluated: neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived NLR [dNLR = neutrophils/(white blood cells ‒ neutrophils)], platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR), (neutrophils × monocytes)/lymphocyte ratio (SIRI), and (neutrophils × monocytes × platelets)/lymphocyte ratio (AISI). AMD patients had significantly lower median values of white blood cells, monocytes, neutrophils, platelets, and mean platelet volume (MPV). Regarding the combined indexes, only AISI was significantly lower in AMD patients than in controls. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis revealed that the ability of AISI and MPV to predict AMD is poor. Results suggests that NLR, dNLR, PLR, MLR, SIRI, and AISI are unreliable disease biomarkers in men with AMD. Larger scale studies are necessary to confirm these findings."
29953307," In South Korea, the National Immunization Program offers a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) for the elderly; however, the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is not included, and vaccination is not offered to younger, at-risk populations. This study offers a comparative analysis of PCV13 and PPSV23 in Korea's adults, stratified by age and risk group. A Markov model with a lifetime horizon was developed from the healthcare perspective. Data sources included the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service, Korea Centre for Disease Control & Prevention and Korean medical institutions. An expert panel tested data validity. The CAPiTA trial and Cochrane meta-analysis were used to obtain vaccine effectiveness data. Regardless of co-morbidity, when the sequential PCV13-PPSV23 strategy was compared to that using PPSV23-only, in elderly populations, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 3,300 USD per quality-adjusted life years (QALY). For the risk group aged ≥65 years, the ICER of the addition of PCV13 over the existing PPSV23-only strategy was 3,404 USD/QALY. However, on replacing PPSV23 with PCV13, for all elderly populations, an ICER of 1,421 USD/QALY resulted; for the risk group aged ≥65 years, the ICER was 1,736 USD/QALY. For the 18-64 year-old risk group, the sequential PCV13-PPSV23 strategy yielded an ICER of 3,629 USD/QALY over the PPSV23-only strategy, and 6,643 USD/QALY compared to no vaccination. Thus, the PCV13→PPSV23 combination strategy for elderly populations was found to be a cost-effective alternative to the current National Immunization Program regardless of co-morbidity. This finding was the same as that for younger, at-risk populations."
29953306," To report long-term outcomes of topical ganciclovir (GCV) and corticosteroids in Korean patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) corneal endotheliitis. This retrospective study included 13 eyes from 13 patients with CMV corneal endotheliitis, with a follow-up period of 24.5 ± 8.2 months. The patients were consistently maintained with topical 2% GCV and 1% prednisolone acetate eyedrop. All patients demonstrated unilateral typical coin-shaped keratic precipitates (KPs) or linear KP, and positive CMV polymerase chain reaction of aqueous humor. After 2 weeks of treatment, all patients showed decrease of clinical signs. During the follow-up, four patients developed mild anterior chamber inflammation with increased intraocular pressure without typical coin-shaped KPs or edema, started to use the initial dose, and resolved the clinical signs. One patient showed recurrence of corneal edema twice, and was administered systemic valgancyclovir for 2 weeks upon second recurrence with resolution of clinical signs. Long-term maintenance therapy with topical GCV and corticosteroids are effective and maintain corneal endothelial function in Korean patients with CMV endotheliitis."
29953305," Endometrioid carcinoma is known for its diverse morphology and may pose a diagnostic dilemma when it presents with a spindle cell component. We present a case of a 65-year-old woman with postmenopausal bleeding. Physical examination showed a mass protruding from the external cervical os. The patient underwent biopsy followed by hysterectomy. Pathologic examination showed an endometrioid endometrial carcinoma with spindle cell differentiation arising in an endometrial polyp, which raised a variety of differential diagnoses. Prior reports of this tumor type showed nonaberrant immunohistochemical expression of p16 and p53. However, this case showed p16 and p53 overexpression indicating that there is a spectrum of these tumors."
29953304," Purpose Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been shown to alleviate psychological distress in patients with cancer. However, patients experience barriers to participating in face-to-face MBCT. Individual Internet-based MBCT (eMBCT) could be an alternative. The study aim was to compare MBCT and eMBCT with treatment as usual (TAU) for psychological distress in patients with cancer. Patients and Methods We obtained ethical and safety approval to include 245 patients with cancer with psychological distress (≥ 11 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) in the study. They were randomly allocated to MBCT (n = 77), eMBCT (n = 90), or TAU (n = 78). Patients completed baseline (T0) and postintervention (T1) assessments. The primary outcome was psychological distress on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes were psychiatric diagnosis, fear of cancer recurrence, rumination, health-related quality of life, mindfulness skills, and positive mental health. Continuous outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed modeling on the intention-to-treat sample. Because both interventions were compared with TAU, the type I error rate was set at P < .025. Results Compared with TAU, patients reported significantly less psychological distress after both MBCT (Cohen's d, .45; P < .001) and eMBCT (Cohen's d, .71; P < .001) . In addition, post-treatment prevalence of psychiatric diagnosis was lower with both MBCT (33% improvement; P = .030) and eMBCT (29% improvement; P = .076) in comparison with TAU (16%), but these changes were not statistically significant. Both interventions reduced fear of cancer recurrence and rumination, and increased mental health-related quality of life, mindfulness skills, and positive mental health compared with TAU (all Ps < .025). Physical health-related quality of life did not improve ( P = .343). Conclusion Compared with TAU, MBCT and eMBCT were similarly effective in reducing psychological distress in a sample of distressed heterogeneous patients with cancer."
29953303," To report a case of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease associated with hepatitis B vaccination. Case report. A 43-year-old Caucasian male presented with a three-week history of blurry vision, pain, photophobia, and redness in both eyes. Three days prior to the onset of symptoms, he had received the hepatitis B virus vaccine. Clinical evaluation revealed multifocal placoid lesions in the posterior pole, choroidal thickening, and serous macular detachment. Targeted laboratory investigations were negative for infectious or autoimmune markers. After treatment with oral corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of symptoms with near-total recovery of visual function. The patient later reported systemic findings of hearing loss, tinnitus, and integumentary changes. A diagnosis of VKH disease was made and inflammation was managed with oral corticosteroids followed by methotrexate for long-term disease control. VKH disease is an inflammatory condition primarily affecting the choroid, retinal pigment epithelium, and outer retina. The underlying etiology is unclear, but it can be associated with a viral prodrome suggesting an infectious trigger in a genetically susceptible individual. Our case suggests that hepatitis B vaccination may trigger a similar inflammatory response."
29953302," Ginkgo leaf tablets (GLTs) and losartan are often simultaneously used for the treatment of hypertension in Chinese clinics. However, the herb-drug interaction between GLT and losartan is still unknown. This study investigates the effects of GLT on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its metabolite EXP3174 in rats and its potential mechanism. The pharmacokinetic profiles of losartan and EXP3174 of orally administered losartan (10 mg/kg) with or without GLT pretreatment (80 mg/kg/day for 10 days) in Sprague-Dawley rats were determined. In vitro, the effects of GLT on the metabolic stability of losartan were investigated with rat liver microsomes. The C The results indicate that GLT might increase the plasma concentration of losartan and decrease the concentration of EXP3174 through inhibiting the metabolism of losartan."
29953301," The evaluation of the trimming surfaces (TS) of tissue blocks from frozen sections may serve as a supplementary examination tool for the intraoperative determination of resection margins of breast cancer specimens. This study aimed at the investigation of the feasibility and reliability of this technique, which has been described only very rarely in literature. Two observers assessed digital images from TS obtained from 57 resection margins. Findings were correlated with the diagnosis of the frozen section (FS) alone and the final diagnosis on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material. The determination of the resection margin on TS was estimated as feasible for all cases. Interobserver congruence rate for TS was 96% (κ = 0.81), which was lower compared with FFPE (100%, κ = 1.0) but superior to FS (89%, κ = 0.67). Intraobserver congruence of the 2 reviewers was 96.5% and 93.0% between TS and FFPE, and 91.1% and 92.5% between FS and FFPE, respectively. The combination of both intraoperative consultation techniques showed similar congruence but a slight improvement for the sensitivity (0.75 to 0.875) for the diagnosis of tumor at the resection margin in FFPE for Reviewer 1 but was unchanged for Reviewer 2. The additional evaluation of TS can be a helpful additional tool for intraoperative margin assessment of breast cancer specimens, in particular, when processing artifacts of FS are encountered."

Retrospective chart review of a case of a 67-year old male who presented following the onset of viral symptoms with an acute onset outer retinopathy, small vessel leakage on fluorescein angiography, and choroidal involvement evident on indocyanine green angiography and near infrared fundus autofluorescence (NIR-AF). Work up for infectious and autoimmune etiologies was negative. Treatment with IV methylprednisolone followed by high dose oral prednisone resulted in improvement in visual acuity, outer retinal reconstitution and resolution of the choroidal changes. Despite this presentation sharing features with both acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR) and multifocal choroiditis (MFC), the case is highly atypical of both entities."

29953298," The incidence of tick-borne diseases (TBDs) is growing worldwide, and vaccines appear as the most effective and environmentally sound intervention for the prevention and control of TBDs. Areas covered: The vaccinomics approach combines omics technologies and bioinformatics for the characterization of tick-host-pathogen molecular interactions and the development of next-generation vaccines. The two main challenges of the vaccinomics approach are the integration and analysis of omics datasets, and the development of screening platforms for the identification of candidate protective antigens. To address these challenges we propose the application of intelligent Big Data analytic techniques for the high throughput discovery and characterization of tick and pathogen derived candidate vaccine protective antigens. Expert commentary: This innovative approach should improve the development and efficacy of vaccines for the control and prevention of TBDs."

29953296," Historically, outcomes of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstructions have been less predictable and reported to yield inferior results when compared with those for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions. To report on the outcomes of double-bundle PCL reconstructions (DB PCLRs) in isolated versus combined injuries and acute versus chronic PCL reconstructions. To compare the outcomes of isolated DB PCLR with isolated ACL reconstruction. Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. All patients who underwent a primary endoscopic DB PCLR for complete PCL tears (grade III) between May 2010 and March 2015 were reviewed. Patient-reported outcome scores (Tegner, Lysholm, WOMAC [Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index], SF-12 [12-item Short Form Health Survey]) and objective posterior stress radiographs were collected preoperatively and at a minimum 2 years postoperatively. A cohort subanalysis was additionally performed between isolated and combined PCL reconstruction and acute versus chronic PCL reconstruction. Patients who underwent isolated ACL reconstructions over the same inclusion period (2010-2015) were selected as a comparison group. One hundred patients who underwent DB PCLR were included in this study. There were 31 isolated PCL injuries, and 69 patients had concurrent combined PCL injuries requiring surgery. The mean follow-up for the PCL cohort was 2.9 years (range, 2-6 years). The median Tegner activity score improved from 2 to 5, Lysholm from 48 to 86, WOMAC from 35.5 to 5, and SF-12 Physical Component Summary from 34 to 54.8 (all P values <.001). The mean side-to-side difference in posterior tibial translation on kneeling stress radiographs improved from 11.0 ± 3.5 mm preoperatively to 1.6 ± 2.0 mm postoperatively ( P < .001). There were no differences in postoperative functional scores between isolated PCL reconstructions and PCL-based multiligament reconstructions (all P values >.229). There was no significant difference in the reported outcome scores between acute and chronic reconstructions (all P values >.087) except for Tegner scores ( P < .001) and patient satisfaction ( P = .011) favoring acutely treated PCL injuries. There were no significant differences between patients who had an isolated DB PCLR and patients who underwent an isolated ACL reconstruction (n = 141) in postoperative outcome scores (all P values >.064). Significantly improved functional and objective outcomes were observed after anatomic DB PCLR at a mean 3 years' follow-up, with low complication rates, regardless of concomitant ligamentous injury or timing to surgery. Additionally, contrary to previous reports, comparable subjective and functional clinical outcomes were achieved compared with an isolated ACL reconstruction control cohort."

It should have read: Arthroscopic cartilage lesion preparation with CM instruments results in superior perpendicularity of surrounding cartilage walls to subchondral bone and greater consistency of debrided lesion depth, as compared with the standard debridement technique with curettes."
29953291," During multiple knee ligament reconstructions, the graft tensioning order may influence the final tibiofemoral orientation and corresponding knee kinematics. Nonanatomic tibiofemoral orientation may result in residual knee instability, altered joint loading, and an increased propensity for graft failure. To biomechanically evaluate the effect of different graft tensioning sequences on knee tibiofemoral orientation after multiple knee ligament reconstructions in a bicruciate ligament (anterior cruciate ligament [ACL] and posterior cruciate ligament [PCL]) with a posterolateral corner (PLC)-injured knee. Controlled laboratory study. Ten nonpaired, fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees were utilized for this study. After reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments and the PLC and proximal graft fixation, each knee was randomly assigned to each of 4 graft tensioning order groups: (1) PCL → ACL → PLC, (2) PCL → PLC → ACL, (3) PLC → ACL → PCL, and (4) ACL → PCL → PLC. Tibiofemoral orientation after graft tensioning was measured and compared with the intact state. Tensioning the ACL first (tensioning order 4) resulted in posterior displacement of the tibia at 0° by 1.7 ± 1.3 mm compared with the intact state ( P = .002). All tensioning orders resulted in significantly increased tibial anterior translation compared with the intact state at higher flexion angles ranging from 2.7 mm to 3.2 mm at 60° and from 3.1 mm to 3.4 mm at 90° for tensioning orders 1 and 2, respectively (all P < .001). There was no significant difference in tibiofemoral orientation in the sagittal plane between the tensioning orders at higher flexion angles. All tensioning orders resulted in increased tibial internal rotation (all P < .001). Tensioning and fixing the PLC first (tensioning order 3) resulted in the most increases in internal rotation of the tibia: 2.4° ± 1.9°, 2.7° ± 1.8°, and 2.0° ± 2.0° at 0°, 30°, and 60°, respectively. None of the tensioning orders restored intact knee tibiofemoral orientation. Tensioning the PLC first should be avoided in bicruciate knee ligament reconstruction with concurrent PLC reconstruction because it significantly increased tibial internal rotation. We recommend that the PCL be tensioned first, followed by the ACL, to avoid posterior translation of the tibia in extension where the knee is primarily loaded during most activities. The PLC should be tensioned last. This study will help guide surgeons in decision making for the graft tensioning order during multiple knee ligament reconstructions."
29953287," Meniscus injuries and associated meniscectomies cause patients long-term pain and discomfort and can lead to joint deterioration. To evaluate a collagen-hyaluronan sponge reinforced with synthetic resorbable polymer fiber for total meniscus reconstruction in a long-term ovine model. Controlled laboratory study. Eleven skeletally mature sheep were implanted with the total meniscus scaffold. At 2 years, explants were evaluated biologically (radial/circumferential histology, immunofluorescence) and mechanically (compression, tension), and articular surfaces were examined for damage. The fiber-reinforced scaffold induced formation of functional neomeniscus tissue that was intact in 8 of 11 animals. The implant was remodeled into organized circumferentially aligned collagen bundles to resist meniscus hoop stresses. Moreover, type II collagen and proteoglycan deposition near the inner margin suggested a direct response to compressive stresses and confirmed fibrocartilage formation. Cartilage damage was observed, but end-stage (severe) joint deterioration associated with meniscectomy was avoided, even with limitations regarding the ovine surgical procedure and postoperative care. A fiber-reinforced total meniscus replacement device induces formation of functional neomeniscus tissue that has the potential to prevent catastrophic joint deterioration associated with meniscectomy. An off-the-shelf meniscus device that can be remodeled into functional tissue and thus prevent or delay the onset of osteoarthritis could address a widespread clinical need after meniscus injury."

29953281," The second article on the use of track and trigger scoring (TTS) and National Early Warning Scoring Systems (NEWS 1 and 2) discusses how their use in relation to some patients can be too sensitive and in the case of others it merely detects late deterioration. This raises concerns that TTS and NEWS focus on a single set of observations at one point in time. They, therefore, ignore the observational trends by failing to compare the latest readings against previous sets of vital signs. It is therefore important that nurses do not rely solely on these tools, but use them in conjunction with their physiological knowledge and clinical assessment to identify deteriorating patients, as well as those who do not require unnecessary escalation of care."

29953277," Nutritional support is seen as a vital component in the battle to attenuate the extreme hypermetabolic response experienced by patients suffering from large thermal injuries. Protein catabolism precipitating protein malnutrition places patients at greater risk of wound infection and sepsis due to delayed wound healing. Underfeeding, aggressive feeding, feeding routes, timing of initiation of feeding and tight insulin control have all been explored extensively in the quest to understand what nutritional treatment will best attenuate the hypermetabolic response. Despite this it is suggested that the majority of patients with large thermal injuries do not receive adequate nutritional support immediately post injury. Nurses have a pivotal role to play in ensuring that thermal injury patients receive appropriate nutritional support based on the best available evidence."
29953275," Heart failure readmissions are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Adequate education on adherence and self-care behaviours can affect readmission rates positively and nurses are at the frontline of patient education. Such education is valuable when establishing heart failure programmes in developing countries, in light of the challenging socioeconomic circumstances in these. This study aimed to evaluate nurses' heart failure knowledge, to assess patients' baseline knowledge, and to evaluate the effectiveness of structured nurse-driven education. a total of 131 cardiac centre-based nurses and 30 chronic heart failure patients participated in the study in Kuwait. Patients were surveyed a second time 3 to 6 months later, while being followed at an advanced heart failure clinic by dedicated heart failure nurses. the majority of the nurses (80%) had not received heart failure education previously, although they were able to recognise most heart failure symptoms. Significant improvement in patients' knowledge was noted between the initial and follow-up surveys. establishing a dedicated advanced heart failure programme to care for patients in a developing country can result in significant improvement in disease awareness and self-care behaviours when led by well-trained heart failure nurses. More research is needed to determine if these findings are shared by other countries in the Middle-East and other developing countries."

29953270," This article describes a study of the phenomenon of supporting patients who are learning to live with diabetes, from a diabetes specialist nurse (DSN) perspective. Guided by principles of reflective lifeworld research, data from six interviews (four in groups and two individual) with 16 DSNs were analysed. The results show that, in order to support learning, DSNs use a self-critical approach with the insight that they should not take over responsibility for their patients' diabetes. The DSNs support, encourage and challenge the patients to self-reflect and take responsibility based on patients' own goals and needs. To provide support, DSNs need to assume a tactful, critically challenging approach, dare to confront patients' fears and other emotions and have the insight to know that the responsibility for learning and integration of the condition lies with the patient. To be able to support patients in this way, it is necessary that the DSN is mentored and supported in this role."

29953268," Recent evidence supports the important role of the circadian system in cancer progression in humans. The aim of the present study is to evaluate clock (cry1, cry2 and per2) and clock-controlled (vascular endothelial growth factor-a, early growth response protein 1 and estrogen receptor β) gene expression in colorectal cancer and adjacent tissue and identify a possible link between survival of patients and expression of above mentioned genes. The study includes 64 patients of both sexes with previously diagnosed colorectal cancer. RNA was extracted from the tumor tissue and adjacent parts of the resected colon, and real-time PCR was used for detection of clock gene expression. Expression of cry2 and per2 was significantly downregulated in tumor tissue compared to adjacent tissues. After splitting of the cohort according to sex, we detected downregulated levels of cry2 and per2 in male patients, but not in females. Splitting of male and female sub-cohorts according to presence of metastases revealed significant donwregulation of cry2 expression in female patients without distant metastasis. Better survival rate was associated with low expression of cry2 in female patients. Moreover, we observed an increase in cry1 expression in female patients with distant metastases in tumor compared to adjacent tissue. Accordingly, women with high expression of cry1 in tumor tissue displayed worse survival, which was not observed in men. Taken together, expression of clock and clock-controlled genes in tumors of males and females clustered according to presence of distant metastases correlated with survival analysis. Studied clock-controlled genes also showed sex-dependent changes. Low expression of vegf-a in tumor correlated with better survival in men but not in women. High expression of estrogen receptor β mRNA was related to better survival in women but not in men. Low expression of vegf-a, egr1 and estrogen receptor β was associated with worse survival in women compared to men. Our data indicate sex-dependent associations between clock and clock-controlled gene expression in cancer tissue and patient's survival prognosis."
29953267," Bartter syndrome (BS) and Gitelman syndrome (GS) are hereditary diseases characterized by hypokalemia with decreased or normal blood pressure (BP). However, BS or GS patients who present with elevated BP levels have been increasingly reported recently. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the presence of BS and GS among individuals with unexplained hypokalemia with hypertension in a clinical setting. Patients presented with unexplained hypertension and hypokalemia admitted to Hypertension Center of Fuwai Hospital from November 2015 to February 2017 were enrolled. High-throughput sequencing for five BS and GS causative genes were performed. Variants were classified using American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) consensus guidelines. Thirty-four patients with unexplained hypertension and hypokalemia were included for genetic analysis. A total number of 10 rare variants were identified in six individuals (mutation detection rate, 17.65%). One homozygous variant carried by one of the 34 patients, KCNJ1 c.941A> G (p.Tyr314Cys), were categorized as likely pathogenic variant and resulted in a diagnostic yield of 2.94%. Eight of the remaining nine variants were predicted to be deleterious by ≥ three bioinformatics software and may give additional potential diagnostic yields. This is the first study performing combined genetic screening for BS and GS pathogenic genes among individuals with unexplained hypertension and hypokalemia. Our data suggested that BS or GS may contribute to the etiology of patients presented with hypertension and hypokalemia. Genetic testing for BS and GS pathogenic genes are recommended to facilitate precision diagnoses and targeted treatment."
29953266," Although inaccurate, non-reproducible blood pressure values can result from non-standardized assessments, recommended approaches to standardize blood pressure measurement are often not followed in research studies. An expert consensus of national and international health and scientific organizations developed recommended minimum standards for assessing blood pressure in research subjects where: 1) blood pressure or hypertension is a major endpoint, or 2) blood pressure is likely a major mediator of the research outcome. Minimum research standards are presented for training of observers, technical aspects of assessing blood pressure, and equipment for both adults and children. The standards are based on prior recommendations some of which did not conform to the current evidence based methods. All new research should require adherence to these minimum standards on the patient populations described above. Readers need to use caution in interpreting studies if the standards are not met in the defined populations."
29953265," Rhythms can be observed at all levels of the biologic integration in humans. The observation that a biological or physiological variable shows a circadian rhythm can be explained by several multifactorial systems including external (exogenous), internal (endogenous) and psychobiological (lifestyle) mechanisms. Our body clock can be synchronized with the environment by external factors, called ""synchronizers"", i.e. the light-dark cycle, but it is also negatively influenced by some pathological conditions or factors, called ""chronodisruptors,"" i.e. aging or low physical activity (PA). The desynchronization of a 24-h rhythm in a chronic manner has been recently defined ""chronodisruption"" or ""circadian disruption."" A very large number of hormonal variables, such as adrenal and gonadal stress steroids, are governed by circadian rhythmicity. Such hormones, in normal conditions, show a peak in the first part of the day, while their typical diurnal fluctuations are totally out of sync in subjects affected by cancer or metabolic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. In general, a flatter slope with altered peaks in cortisol and testosterone circadian rhythms has been observed in pathological individuals. PA, specifically chronic exercise, seems to play a key role as synchronizer for the whole circadian system in such pathologies even if specific data on steroids circadian pattern are still sparse and contradictory. Recently, it has been proposed that low-intensity chronic PA could be an effective intervention to decrease morning cortisol levels in pathological subjects. The standardization of all confounding factors is needed to reach more clear evidence-based results."
29953264," The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is frequently used to support severely compromised ventricles in critically ill patients. Its relatively affordability and ease of insertion has cemented its position as the first line of treatment for hemodynamic support in cardiogenic shock. Accordingly, the current ACC/AHA recommendations maintain a Class 2A for the use of IABP in shock. However, a review of the current literature suggests that the evidence supporting the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines are equivocal. Alternative uses for IABP such as perioperative support during high-risk cardiac surgery, treatment of left ventricular distention on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and as bridge to transplant have been proposed. The effectiveness of the IABP in these clinical situations remains largely unproven, due to the paucity of available data."
29953263," Disruptions to the circadian rhythm can lead to altered metabolism. Modification of thyroid function may be a reason why circadian misalignment may contribute to future metabolic disorders. We investigated whether circadian disruption through constant light (LL) can lead to variations in hormone levels associated with thyroid function. Mice were exposed to LL or a 12:12 Light:Dark (LD) cycle for 6 weeks; then glucose tolerance and thyroid hormone levels were measured at ZT 6 and ZT 18. There was day/night variation in glucose tolerance, but LL had no effect. LL reduced TSH, increased fT4, and abolished day/night variation in fT3 and leptin. These findings illustrate that LL alters thyroid-related hormones, providing evidence of a link between circadian disruption and thyroid function."
29953262," To the best of our knowledge, only two studies analyzed the relationship between HRV and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in colon cancer patients. The aim of this study was to analyze changes in the autonomic activity of colon cancer patients using heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV) measures, and to verify if HRV and BPV parameters correlate with hemodynamic indices in this group (…) and the plasma levels of CEA. Presence of colon cancer is associated with changes in autonomic activity, namely parasympathetic-sympathetic imbalance in form of sympathetic overdrive. Cancer-related autonomic dysfunction may contribute to impairment of gastrointestinal motility."
29953261," Early recognition of neoantigen-expressing cells is complex, involving multiple immune cell types. In this study, in vivo, we examined how antigen-presenting cell (APC) subtypes coordinate and induce an immunological response against neoantigen-expressing cells, particularly in the absence of a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), which is normally required to license APCs to present foreign or self-antigens as immunogens. Using two reductionist models of neoantigen-expressing cells and two cancer models, we demonstrated that natural IgM is essential for the recognition and initiation of adaptive immunity against neoantigen-expressing cells. Natural IgM antibodies form a cellular immune complex with the neoantigen-expressing cells. This immune complex licenses surveying monocytes to present neoantigens as immunogens to CD4+ T cells. Helper CD4+ T cells, in turn, use CD40L to license cross-presenting CD40+ Batf3+ dendritic cells to elicit a cytotoxic T cell response against neoantigen-expressing cells. Any break along this immunological chain reaction results in the escape of neoantigen-expressing cells. This study demonstrates the surprising, essential role of natural IgM as the initiator of a sequential signaling cascade involving multiple immune cell subtypes. This sequence is required to coordinate an adaptive immune response against neoantigen-expressing cells."
29953260," Metabolic stability is an important property of drug candidates and pharmaceutical companies often have human liver microsomal (HLM) data for a large number of molecules, enabling development of global quantitative structure-activity relationship models. This study describes a strategy for building a global HLM quantitative structure-activity relationship model, applicable also to datasets of limited size. By using external congeneric test sets, a realistic description of the performance in the future applied setting and a reliable prediction confidence method is obtained. The limited ability of the HLM model to generalize in chemical space to show the importance of internal model development and continuous updating of global HLM models, as well as the importance of a validated prediction confidence method."
29953259," The immune responses elicited following delivery of DNA vaccines to the skin has previously been shown to be significantly enhanced by the addition of electroporation (EP) to the treatment protocol. Principally, EP increases the transfection of pDNA into the resident skin cells. In addition to increasing the levels of in vivo transfection, the physical insult induced by EP is associated with activation of innate pathways which are believed to mediate an adjuvant effect, further enhancing DNA vaccine responses. Here, we have investigated the possible mechanisms associated with this adjuvant effect, primarily focusing on the cell death pathways associated with the skin EP procedure independent of pDNA delivery. Using the minimally invasive CELLECTRA®-3P intradermal electroporation device that penetrates the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin, we have investigated apoptotic and necrotic cell death in relation to the vicinity of the electrode needles and electric field generated. Employing the well-established TUNEL assay, we detected apoptosis beginning as early as one hour after EP and peaking at the 4 hour time point. The majority of the apoptotic events were detected in the epidermal region directly adjacent to the electrode needle. Using a novel propidium iodide in vivo necrotic cell death assay, we detected necrotic events concentrated in the epidermal region adjacent to the electrode. Furthermore, we detected up-regulation of calreticulin expression on skin cells after EP, thus labeling these cells for uptake by dendritic cells and macrophages. These results allow us to delineate the cell death mechanisms occurring in the skin following intradermal EP independently of pDNA delivery. We believe these events contribute to the adjuvant effect observed following electroporation at the skin treatment site."
29953258," The incidence of overuse injury to the elbow among baseball pitchers continues to rise, despite extensive efforts at pitch count regulations and emphasis on proper throwing mechanics. To determine if the medial elbow experiences increased torque levels as a baseball pitcher fatigues through the course of a simulated game. Descriptive laboratory study. High school and collegiate baseball pitchers were recruited for this simulated game study. Each pitcher completed a simulated game consisting of 6 innings and a standardized pitching scheme of fastballs, curveballs, and changeups. In total, each pitcher threw 90 pitches. Fatigue was reported per inning with a visual analog scale, and pitch velocity was captured per pitch with a radar gun. Outcome measures were assessed with a validated mobile sensor and included medial elbow torque, arm speed, arm rotation, and arm slot. Linear and quadratic regression modeling was used to evaluate the relationship between pitcher fatigue and pitching kinematics. A total of 11 pitchers (mean age, 17.6 years; range, 15-20 years) completed the study. Visual analog scale fatigue scores increased 0.72 points per inning pitched ( P < .01, effect size = 0.64). Medial elbow torque also increased beyond inning 3, with an increase of 0.84 N·m each inning ( P < .01, effect size = 0.08), while pitch velocity decreased (0.28 mph per inning, P < .01, effect size = 0.27). Fastballs generated the greatest amount of medial elbow torque (49.3 ± 1.4 N·m, P < .01, effect size = 0.24). There were no differences in arm rotation ( P = .42) or arm speed ( P = .80) as the game progressed. However, arm slot decreased with each successive inning (0.73° on average per inning, P = .03, effect size = 0.12). No adverse outcomes were noted with use of the mobile sensor. In this simulated game analysis, pitchers experienced increased fatigue after each successive inning. While the average pitch velocity declined with each successive inning, the torque on the medial elbow increased after inning 3. These findings signify a possible relationship between fatigue and injury risk."
29953257," This study explored the feasibility of intraparenchymal delivery (Gadoteridol and/or AAV5-GFP) into the cerebellum of nonhuman primates using real-time MRI-guided CED technology. All animals tolerated the neurosurgical procedure without any clinical sequela. Gene expression was detected within the cerebellar parenchyma at the site of infusion and resulted in transduction of neuronal cell bodies and fibers. Histopathology indicated localized damage along the stem of the cannula tract. These findings demonstrate the potential of real-time MRI-guided CED to deliver therapeutics into the cerebellum, which has extensive reciprocal connections and may be used as a target for the treatment of neurological disorders."
29953255," Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combines intra-arterial delivery of a chemotherapeutic agent with selective embolization to obtain a synergistic effect. TACE is recognized as the standard treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma patients at an intermediate stage. If conventional TACE, defined as the injection of an emulsion of a drug with ethiodized oil, still has a role to play, the development of drug-eluting beads has allowed many improvements and optimization of the technique.

29953254," Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex disorder that is associated with significant morbidity. While many recent advances have been made with new diagnostic and therapeutic tools, a deeper understanding of its basic pathophysiology is needed to continue this trend towards improving treatments. By utilizing an unbiased, high-throughput transcriptomic analysis of two well-established mouse models of colitis, we set out to uncover novel coding and non-coding RNAs that are differentially expressed in the setting of colonic inflammation. RNA-seq analysis was performed using colonic tissue from two mouse models of colitis, a dextran sodium sulfate induced model and a genetic-induced model in mice lacking IL-10. We identified 81 coding RNAs that were commonly altered in both experimental models. Of these coding RNAs, 12 of the human orthologs were differentially expressed in a transcriptomic analysis of IBD patients. Interestingly, 5 of the 12 of human differentially expressed genes have not been previously identified as IBD-associated genes, including ubiquitin D. Our analysis also identified 15 non-coding RNAs that were differentially expressed in either mouse model. Surprisingly, only three non-coding RNAs were commonly dysregulated in both of these models. The discovery of these new coding and non-coding RNAs expands our transcriptional knowledge of mouse models of IBD and offers additional targets to deepen our understanding of the pathophysiology of IBD."
29953253," Infants with congenital diarrheal disorders caused by enteroendocrine cell dysgenesis, or the loss of intestinal endocrine cells, by itself causes severe malabsorptive diarrhea though the mechanism is unknown. The transcription factor 'Aristaless-related homeobox' (Arx), is specifically expressed in intestinal endocrine cells. This study seeks to characterize the early malabsorptive phenotype of mice deficient for Arx using cell-type specific gene ablation in Villin-Cre; Arx"
29953252," To describe concussion rates in high school athletes and involvement of healthcare professionals in concussion diagnosis, management and compliance with return to play (RTP) guidelines. Data were analysed from injury reports in the National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance System between 2009/2010 and 2012/2013 to identify student athletes with concussion and determine compliance with RTP guidelines. Compliance with RTP guidelines was examined using logistic regression, adjusting for sport and injury-related variables. There were 5611 concussions recorded during 15 712 475 athlete exposures (AEs), a rate of 3.6 concussions per 10 000 AEs. Rates were higher during competition and among girls compared to boys in gender equitable sports. Healthcare professionals were less likely to be present at the time of concussion for girls' sports, lower competition levels and practices. Compliance with RTP guidelines was higher for athletes with recurrent concussions, those sustained in collision sports, for athletes reporting more symptoms and when a physician made the RTP decision. Presence of healthcare professionals and compliance with RTP guidelines varied by sport, gender, level of play and exposure type. High school athletes with concussion are best served by assessment teams with athletic trainers and physicians working together to manage concussions and contribute to RTP decisions."
29953251, HDAC8 is one of the crucial enzymes involved in malignancy. Structural explorations of HDAC8 inhibitory activity and selectivity are required. A mathematical framework was constructed to explore important molecular fragments responsible for HDAC8 inhibition. Bayesian classification models were developed on a large set of structurally diverse HDAC8 inhibitors. This study helps to understand the structural importance of HDAC8 inhibitors. The hydrophobic aryl cap function is important for HDAC8 inhibition whereas benzamide moiety shows a negative impact on HDAC8 inhibition. This work validates our previously proposed structural features for better HDAC8 inhibition. The comparative learning between the statistical and intelligent methods will surely enrich future drug design aspects of HDAC8 inhibitors.
29953249," This report describes the case of a 58-year-old man with moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) and pre-accident brain disorders who had multiple persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms. NeuroQuant® 2.0 and NeuroGage® 2.0 MRI brain volume analyses were used during the chronic stage of injury (> 1 year after injury) to help understand the effects of the TBI on his brain volume. NeuroQuant® showed widespread cross-sectional atrophy, especially in the frontal and temporal lobes, consistent with encephalomalacia seen on the MRIs. Several of his clinical symptoms were consistent with the volume abnormalities. NeuroGage® longitudinal analyses of volume change from the time 1 to time 2 magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormally rapid atrophy and ventricular enlargement. The high rates of volume change were much more consistent with the relatively recent effects of TBI than with effects of the much more chronic pre-accident brain disorders."
29953247," Beyond finding inhibitors that show high binding affinity to the respective target, there is the challenge of optimizing their properties with respect to metabolic and toxicological issues, as well as further off-target effects. To reduce the experimental effort of synthesizing and testing actual substances in corresponding assays, virtual screening has become an indispensable toolbox in preclinical development. The scope of application covers the prediction of molecular properties including solubility, metabolic liability and binding to antitargets, such as the hERG channel. Furthermore, prediction of binding sites and drugable targets are emerging aspects of virtual screening. Issues involved with the currently applied computational models including machine learning algorithms are outlined, such as limitations to the accuracy of prediction and overfitting."
29953245," Scoring functions are important component of protein-protein docking methods. They need to be evaluated on high-quality benchmarks to reveal their strengths and weaknesses. Evaluation results obtained on such benchmarks can provide valuable guidance for developing more advanced scoring functions. Methodology & results: In our comparative assessment of scoring functions for protein-protein interactions benchmark, the performance of a scoring function was characterized by 'docking power' and 'scoring power'. A high-quality dataset of 273 protein-protein complexes was compiled and employed in both tests. Four scoring functions, including FASTCONTACT, ZRANK, dDFIRE and ATTRACT were tested as demonstration. ZRANK and ATTRACT exhibited encouraging performance in the docking power test. However, all four scoring functions failed badly in the scoring power test. Our comparative assessment of scoring functions for protein-protein interaction benchmark is created especially for assessing the scoring functions applicable to protein-protein interactions. It is different from other benchmarks for assessing protein-protein docking methods. Our benchmark is available to the public at www.pdbbind-cn.org/download/CASF-PPI/ ."
29953243, Host cavitands and organic guest molecules independently adsorbed on silica particles when mixed and shaken in the presence of a few drops of water underwent intra- and interparticle migration to form capsular complexes that were not formed either in water or organic solvents. Importance of cavitand migration and tumbling on silica surface was established by demonstrating that covalently linked cavitands do not form capsular complexes. The encapsulated guests exhibited selective photochemistry as they do within an organic capsule in solution.
29953242," An efficient transition-metal-free oxidative cyclization reaction using isatins and alkynes for the facile synthesis of structurally diverse 4-quinolones has been developed. Intriguingly, switchable access to substituted 3-carboxylate-4-quinolones and 1-vinyl-3-carboxylate-4-quinolones could be achieved by choosing a different base in the reaction. The obtained products could undergo further transformations, increasing the application potential of the method in organic synthesis."
29953241, The first member of S-heterocycloarenes was synthesized from an easily prepared phenanthrylene ethynylene macrocycle through diyne cyclocondensation and a Scholl reaction. The solution-processed thin film of this S-heterocycloarene behaved as a p-type semiconductor.
29953240," The activation of disulfides by Cu(II) salts has been realized, which triggers a highly efficient electrophilic sulfenoamination of alkenes under aerobic conditions. Various sulfenyl N-heterocycles and their Selena counterparts were produced regioselectively, with no competing disulfidation products detected. Mechanistic studies suggest a profound influence of the counterions on the Lewis acidic copper center, and the important roles of oxygen and DMSO as co-oxidants for these cyclization processes."
29953239," Spin-orbit torques, which utilize spin currents arising from the spin-orbit coupling, offer a novel method for the electrical switching of the magnetization with perpendicular anisotropy. However, the necessity of an external magnetic field to achieve deterministic switching is an obstacle for realizing practical spin-orbit torque devices with all-electric operation. Here, we report field-free spin-orbit torque switching by exploiting the domain-wall motion in an anti-notched microwire with perpendicular anisotropy, which exhibits multidomain states stabilized by the domain-wall surface tension. The combination of spin-orbit torque, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, and domain-wall surface-tension-induced geometrical pinning allows the deterministic control of the domain wall and offers a novel method to achieve a field-free spin-orbit torque switching. Our work demonstrates the proof of concept of a perpendicular memory cell that can be readily adopted in three-terminal magnetic memory."
29953238," An efficient and step-economic new approach to alkyl citrate natural products from a cyclobutene diester is presented. The key sequence involves a formal [2 + 2]-cycloaddition of a silylketene acetal with dimethylacetylene dicarboxylate to provide the cyclobutene diester 14 with 4.5:1 stereoselectivity. Exposure of diester 14 in acidic methanol effected a hydrolysis, intramolecular oxy-Michael reaction, and cyclobutanone methanolysis cascade to give the triester 15. Iodination and elimination then afforded a key alkyl citrate alkene intermediate, which was converted into the natural products (-)-CJ-13,982 (1), (-)-CJ-13,981 (2), and (-)-L-731,120 (3) via a cross-metathesis and subsequent reduction."
29953237," Native chemical ligation (NCL) employing the N-methylbenzimidazolinone (MeNbz) linker readily provided the linear precursor of a 16-mer peptide that is difficult to obtain by stepwise solid-phase peptide synthesis. NCL and the workup conditions were improved toward a protocol that allows for quantitative removal of the 4-hydroxymercaptophenol additive and subsequent formation of the disulfide bridge in the NCL cocktail by oxidation in air, tolerated by the presence of tris(hydroxypropyl)phosphine."
29953236," A fundamental understanding of the structure and dynamics of organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC) materials allows for a more rational design of molecular chemistry toward improved mechanical and electrochemical performances. This Letter investigates the solid-state structure and ion dynamics of two imidazolium-based protic organic ionic plastic crystals as well as the ion-transport properties in both compounds. A combination of DSC, conductivity, NMR, and synchrotron X-ray studies revealed that a subtle change in cation chemistry results in substantial differences in the thermal phase behavior, crystalline structures, as well as the ion conduction mechanisms in the protic plastic crystal compounds. Whereas most of the research nowadays has been focused on the optimization of chemistry of cations and anions, this work highlights the importance of microstructures on the ion transport rate and pathways of the OIPC materials."
29953235," To break free of the limitations imposed by three-dimensional (3D) perovskites, such as their lackluster stability, researchers have opened new frontiers into lower-dimensional perovskite derivatives. Thanks to advances in solvent-based synthesis methods, zero-dimensional (0D) inorganic perovskites, mainly Cs4PbBr6, have recently reemerged in various forms (from single crystals to nanocrystals) as materials with properties that bridge organic molecules and inorganic semiconductors. These properties include intrinsic Pb2+ ion emission, large exciton binding energy, and small polaron formation upon photoexcitation, in addition to anomalous green photoluminescence with improved stability and high quantum yield. Moreover, the demonstration of Cs4PbBr6-based LED devices highlights the accelerating efforts towards their application and motivates further investigations of these emerging materials. This perspective summarizes the progress in the field of 0D Cs4PbBr6 perovskites, focusing on their molecular-electronic properties and hotly debated green photoluminescence. We conclude by presenting the implications of the unique findings and suggesting opportunities for the future development and applications of these 0D perovskites."
29953234," A straightforward synthetic pathway allowing the access to anti or syn 2-amino-1,3-diol scaffolds is presented. The strategy relies on a diastereoselective organocatalyzed decarboxylative aldol reaction of a N-Boc-hemimalonate that is easily formed from commercial N-Boc-diethyl malonate. Although this method has been optimized previously with the N-Bz-hemimalonate analogue, this key step was reinvestigated with the N-Boc derivative to improve the required reaction time, the yield and the diastereoselectivity. The new conditions enhance this transformation, and quantitative yields and anti/syn ratios up to 96 : 4 can be obtained. The anti aldol product was easily isolated in pure form, then taken forward as the key precursor in the preparation of both a set of ten N-/O-alkylated anti 2-amino-1,3-diol derivatives and the syn congeners."
29953233," In order to temper their prohibitively high viscosities, ionic liquids are commonly mixed with polar cosolvents to retain favorable physical properties and make them suitable for industrial applications. Molecular dynamics simulations of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Im41][BF4]) mixed with acetonitrile (CH3CN) are conducted primarily to test the accuracy of a composite force field (FF) and also to provide some insights into the solvation and frictional characteristics of this mixture. The force field combines the united-atom model for imidazolium ionic liquids of Zhong et al. [J. Phys. Chem. B 115, 10027 (2011)] with the acetonitrile model of Nikitin and Lyubartsev [J. Comput. Chem. 28, 2020 (2007)]. Comparison of simulated properties such as mixture densities, viscosities, electrical conductivities, and component diffusion coefficients to experimental data at 298 K show this combined FF provides reasonable accuracy for both static and dynamic properties. Component rotational dynamics, as well as those of a dilute benzene solute, probed via new 2H-NMR T1 measurements, are also reasonably reproduced. Simulated coordination numbers reveal virtually random mixing between the [Im41][BF4] and CH3CN components in this system. Comparison of translational diffusion coefficients and rotation times to simple hydrodynamic predictions indicates the friction on most motions becomes increasingly decoupled from solution viscosity as the [Im41][BF4] concentration increases."

29953228," Detailed mineral profile of a selection of commercially available complete dry dog foods was determined using ICP-MS (Se, Cu, Mn and non-essential trace elements) flame photometry (Na and K), atomic and molecular spectrophotometry (Ca, P, Mg, Zn and Fe). The contribution of ingredients to the mineral composition was correlated to the food market segment. Results showed an oversupply of essential elements due to the energy density effect on feed intake. Additives contributed from 40.8 to 55.1% to the total trace elements contents. With the exception of Se, all trace elements were supplied above the nutritional requirements of adult dogs. Legal limits of Cu, Se and Zn were surpassed. The content of non-essential trace elements included values in the range of nanograms to micrograms per kg, without surpassing safe upper limits. This work brings awareness to the need to find supplementation strategies that ensure nutritional adequacy and avoid waste."
29953227," We investigated the constituents of Leucaena leucocephala foliage collected from Guangdong province in China, and isolated seventeen diverse flavonoids (1-17), including flavones (5-9, 11, and 12), flavonols (1, 10 and 16), flavanone 4, flavanonol 15 and flavonol glycosides (2, 3, 13, 14 and 17). Flavonoids quercetin (1), quercetin-3-O-α-rhamnopyranoside (2), and myricetin-3-O-α-rhamnopyranoside (17) were the major flavonoids components in L. leucocephala leaves, at a total concentration of about 2.5% of dry matter. pHRE-Luc inductive activity to mimic the activation of erythropoietin (EPO) gene, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and antioxidant activities of isolated flavonoids (1-17) were evaluated. Flavonoids 7, 10 and 13 could strongly induce the transcriptional activity of pHRE-Luc, which indicated their potential to induce the expression of EPO. Flavonoids 7, 10, 13, and 17 displayed strong anti-inflammatory activity, relatively equal to the positive control dexamethasone. Flavonoids 1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 16, and 17 showed stronger antioxidant activities of DPPH radical scavenging capacity than ascorbic acid. Flavonoids 1, 2 and 10 showed weak cellular antioxidant activities against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) induced ROS formation. Flavonoid rhamnoside 2 and arabinoside 3 undergone deglycosylation to the aglycone quercetin under anaerobic incubation with cattle rumen microorganisms. Furthermore, the potential health benefits for ruminant of flavonoids, which was rich in L. leucocephala foliage, was also discussed."
29953226, Lack of a consistent PM10 (particulate matter smaller than 10 µm) database at high spatial resolution hinders in assessing the environmental impact of PM10 in India. Here we propose an alternate approach to estimate PM10 database. Aerosol extinction coefficients at the surface are calculated from mid-visible aerosol optical depth from MERRA-2 reanalysis data using characteristics vertical profiles from CALIOP and then are converted to PM10 mass using aerosol property information and microphysical data. The retrieved PM10 are bias-corrected and evaluated (R2=0.85) against coincident ground-based data maintained under Central Pollution Control Board network. PM10 exposure exceeds Indian annual air quality standard in 72.3% districts. Transition in PM10 exposure from the monsoon (Jun-Sep) to post-monsoon season (Oct-Nov) translates to 1-2% higher all-cause mortality risk over the polluted Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB). Mortality risk increases in the central to eastern IGB and central India and reduces in Delhi national capital region in the winter (Dec-Feb) relative to the post-monsoon season. Mortality risk decreases by 0.5-1.8% in most parts of India in the pre-monsoon season (Mar-May). Our results quantify the vulnerability in terms of seasonal transition in all-cause mortality risks due to PM10 exposure at district level for the first time in India.
29953225," Quassinoids are bitter constituents characteristic of the family Simaroubaceae. Eighteen C20 quassinoids, including nine new quassinoid glycosides, named as chuglycosides A-I (1-6 and 8-10), were identified from the samara of Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle. All of the quassinoids showed potent anti-Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) activity. A preliminary structure-anti-TMV activity relationship of quassinoids was discussed. The effects of three quassinoids, including chaparrinone (12), glaucarubinone (15), and ailanthone (16), on the accumulation of TMV coat protein (CP) were studied by Western blot analysis. And ailanthone (16) was further investigated for its influence on TMV spread in Nicotiana benthamiana plant."
29953224," Shellfish is a common part of indigenous cuisines throughout the world and one of the major sources of human exposure to arsenic (As). We evaluated As speciation in shellfish after cooking and gastrointestinal digestion in this study. Results showed that washing and cooking (boiling and steaming) can reduce As exposures from shellfish. The use of spices during cooking processes also helped to reduce the bioaccessibility of total As. Through mass balance calculations, we verified the transformation of methylated As compounds into inorganic As in shellfish takes place during cooking and that As demethylation can occur during simulated gastrointestinal digestion. In vivo demethylation of As after gastrointestinal digestion was also demonstrated in laboratory mice. This increase in inorganic As during digestion suggests that risks of As toxicity from shellfish consumption are being underestimated. Further studies on the mechanisms of As speciation transformation in food are necessary for more thorough risk assessments."
29953223," An expanding trend for genetically engineered crops is to cultivate varieties in which two or more single trait products have been combined using conventional breeding to produce a stacked trait product that provides a useful grouping of traits. Here we report results from compositional analysis of several GE stacked trait products from maize and soybean. The results demonstrate that these products are each compositionally equivalent to a relevant non-GE comparator variety, except for predictable shifts in the fatty acid profile in the case of stacked trait products that contain a trait, MON 87705, that confers a high-oleic acid phenotype in soybean. In each case, the conclusion on compositional equivalence for the stacked trait product reflects the conclusions obtained for the single trait products. These results provide strong support for conducting a reassessment of those regulatory guidelines that mandate explicit characterization of stacked trait products produced through conventional breeding."
29953222," Biohazards and chemical hazards as well as radioactive hazards have always been a threat to human health. The search for solutions to these problems is an ongoing worldwide effort. In order to control biohazards by chemical methods, a synthetically useful fused tricyclic iodine-rich compound, 2,6-diiodo-3,5-dinitro-4,9-dihydrodipyrazolo [1,5- a:5',1'- d][1,3,5]triazine (5), with good detonation performance was synthesized, characterized, and its properties determined. This compound which acts as an agent defeat weapon has been shown to destroy certain microorganisms effectively by releasing iodine after undergoing decomposition or combustion. The small iodine residues remaining will not be deleterious to human life after 1 month."
29953221," The evaluation of mineral oils by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) provided high acceptable daily intakes for classes largely falling into the mass range strongly accumulated by humans. Because they are roughly 2 orders of magnitude above the present exposure, they authorize strongly increased exposure. An approach based on accumulation seems more adequate. Increased organ weights might be more critical than granulomas. Aromatic hydrocarbons with 1-2 aromatic rings should be distinguished from those with at least 3 aromatic rings. If mineral oil saturated hydrocarbon limits were low, no limit might be needed for the 1-2 ring aromatics. It should be considered to phase out substantial use of mineral oils in food application."
29953220," Melatonin acts as a crucial signaling and antioxidant molecule with multiple physiological functions in organisms. To explore effects of exogenous melatonin on postharvest browning and its possible mechanisms in litchi fruit, 'Ziniangxi' litchi fruit were treated with an aqueous solution of melatonin at 0.4 mM and then stored at 25 °C for 8 days. The results revealed that melatonin strongly suppressed pericarp browning and delayed discoloration during storage. Melatonin treatment reduced membrane relative leakage rate, and inhibited the generation of superoxide radical (O2-.), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Melatonin treatment markedly promoted the accumulation of endogenous melatonin, delayed loss of total phenolics, flavonoids and anthocyanins, as well as enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6), ascorbate peoxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11) and glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2). By contrast, the activities of browning related-enzymes including polyphenoloxidase (PPO, EC 1.10.3.1) and peroxidase (POD, EC 1.11.1.7) were reduced. In addition, melatonin treatment up-regulated the expression of four genes encoding enzymes for repair of oxidized proteins, including LcMsrA1, LcMsrA2, LcMsrB1 and LcMsB2. These findings indicate that the delay of pericarp browning and senescence by melatonin in harvested litchi fruit could be attributed to maintenance of redox homeostasis by improving antioxidant capacity and modulating repair of oxidatively damaged proteins."
29953219," Deoxy-sugars often play a critical role in modulating the potency of many bioactive natural products. Accordingly, there has been sustained interest in methods for their synthesis over the past several decades. The focus of much of this work has been on developing new glycosylation reactions that permit the mild and selective construction of deoxyglycosides. This Review covers classical approaches to deoxyglycoside synthesis, as well as more recently developed chemistry that aims to control the selectivity of the reaction through rational design of the promoter. Where relevant, the application of this chemistry to natural product synthesis will also be described."
29953218," A simple yet versatile solution-based process to produce colloidal silica hexapods is developed in which various shapes of silica rods are grown on the faces of cubes in a controlled manner. In the presence of hematite cubic particles, water droplets nucleate on the surface of hematite by phase separation in pentanol. By adjusting the water concentration, six droplets can form on each face of the hematite cube. Silica precursor is then admisnistered into the system which gradually diffuses into the water droplets through the oil phase. Within the droplets, hydrolysis and condensation of the precursors take place, leading to formation of silica rods. As a result, silica hexapods on a magnetic hematite cubic seed are produced. Furthermore, when the emulsions are aged at 60 oC prior to the silica growth, the water con-tent in the solution are decreases gradually due to evaporation and spiky sharp hexapods produced. On the other hand, when orga-nosilane precursor is added together, pancake-like hexapods are formed due to the reduction of interfacial tension. These colloidal hexa-pods can further be utilized as new building blocks for self-assembly for constructing functional materials or as a model system for under-standing collective behaviors."
29953217," Advances in carbohydrate chemistry have certainly made common oligosaccharides much more accessible. However, many current methods still rely heavily upon specialized knowledge of carbohydrate chemistry. The application of automated technologies to chemical and life science applications such as genomics and proteomics represents a vibrant field. These automated technologies also present opportunities for their application to organic synthesis, including that of the synthesis of oligosaccharides. However, application of automated methods to the synthesis of carbohydrates is an underdeveloped area as compared to other classes of biomolecules. The overarching goal of this review article is to present the advances that have been made at the interface of carbohydrate chemistry and automated technology."
29953216," Salimabromide is an antibiotic polyketide that was previously isolated from the obligate marine myxobacterium Enhygromyxa salina, and its densely functionalized and conformationally rigid tetracyclic framework is unprecedented in nature. Herein we report the first chemical synthesis of the target structure by employing a series of well-orchestrated, robust transformations, highlighted by an acid-promoted, powerful Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement/Friedel-Crafts cyclization sequence to forge the two adjacent quaternary carbon centers embedded in the tetrahydronaphthalene. A high-yielding ketiminium mediated [2+2]-cycloaddition was also utilized for the simultaneous construction of the remaining three stereocenters."
29953215," Transcriptomics, high-throughput assays, and adverse outcome pathways (AOP) are promising approaches applied to toxicity monitoring in the 21st century, but development of these methods is challenging for nonmodel organisms and emerging contaminants. For example, Endocrine Disrupting Compounds (EDCs) may cause reproductive impairments and feminization of male bivalves; however, the mechanism linked to this adverse outcome is unknown. To develop mechanism-based biomarkers that may be linked through an AOP, we exposed Mytilus edulis to 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (5 and 50 ng/L) and 4-nonylphenol (1 and 100 μg/L) for 32 and 39 days. When mussels were exposed to these EDCs, we found elevated female specific transcripts and significant female-skewed sex ratios using a RT-qPCR assay. We performed gene expression analysis on digestive gland tissue using an M. edulis microarray and through network and targeted analyses identified the nongenomic estrogen signaling pathway and steroidogenesis pathway as the likely mechanisms of action for a putative AOP. We also identified several homologues to genes within the vertebrate steroidogenesis pathway including the cholesterol side chain cleavage complex. From this AOP, we designed the Coastal Biosensor for Endocrine Disruption (C-BED) assay which was confirmed in the laboratory and tested in the field."

29953213," Allostery is a regulatory phenomenon whereby ligand binding to one site influences the binding of the same or a different ligand to another site on a macromolecule. The physical origins of allosteric regulation remain under intense investigation. In general terms, ligand-induced structural changes, perturbations of residue-specific dynamics, and surrounding solvent molecules all potentially contribute to the global energetics of allostery. While the role of solvent is generally well understood in regulatory events associated with major protein structural rearrangements, the degree to which protein dynamics impact solvent degrees of freedom is unclear, particularly in cases of dynamically-driven allostery. With the aid of new crystal structures, extensive calorimetric and residue-specific dynamics studies over a range of timescales and temperatures, we dissect for the first time the relative degree to which changes in solvent entropy and residue-specific dynamics impact dynamically-driven, allosteric inhibition of DNA binding by Zn in the zinc efflux repressor, CzrA (chromosomal zinc-regulated repressor). We show that non-native residue-specific dynamics in allosterically impaired CzrA mutants are accompanied by significant perturbations in solvent entropy that cannot be predicted from crystal structures. We conclude that functional dynamics are not necessarily restricted to protein residues, but involve surface water molecules that may be responding to ligand (Zn)-mediated perturbations in protein internal motions that define the conformational ensemble, rather than major structural rearrangements."
29953212," The 5-substituted 2-aryliminopyrrolyl ligand precursors of the type 5-R-2-[ N-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)formimino]-1 H-pyrrole (R = 2,6-Me"
29953211," Gold nanostars (GNSs) have received considerable attention in surface-enhanced spectroscopies, catalysis, biosensing, photothermal therapy, and photovoltaics because of their unique optical properties arising from the anisotropic structure. GNSs typically consisting of a central core and several protruding tips are usually synthesized by a seed-mediated growth approach, but the growth mechanism and optical properties have yet to be fully understood. Here, we systematically investigate the seed-mediated growth process of GNSs to gain an insight into the growth mechanism and evolution of their optical and photothermal properties. By tailoring the core size, tip length and tip angle, the main localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak wavelength can be broadly tuned from the visible to near-infrared (NIR) region. Our observations show that the protruding tips grow rapidly away from the central core at the initial growth stage, leading to a red-shift of the main LSPR peak. The preferential deposition of gold atoms onto the gold core takes place at the later growth stage, gradually blue-shifting the main LSPR peak. GNSs exhibit a large molar extinction coefficient ranging from 4.0 × 10"
29953210," As hypoxia is an important factor to limit chemotherapeutic efficacy in tumors, we herein report three ruthenium(II)-arene complexes containing a hypoxia inducible factor-1α inhibitor (YC-1), which endow the organometallic complexes with potential for hypoxia targeting. In vitro tests showed the resulting complexes had higher anticancer activities in hypoxia than in normoxia against the tested cancer cell lines. Western blot analysis revealed that complexes 1-3 blocked HIF-1α protein accumulation under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, these complexes displayed much less cytotoxicity toward the normal human umbilical vein endothelial cell line (HUVEC), indicating that complexes 1-3 may be selectively cytotoxic for human cancer cell lines. These findings proved that ligation with YC-1 endowed these organometallic ruthenium(II) complexes with potential for hypoxia targeting in addition to enhancing their anticancer activities."
29953209," One of the most important aspects in controlling colloidal deposition is manipulating the homogeneity of the deposit by avoiding the coffee-ring effect caused by capillary flow inside the droplet during drying. After our previous work where we achieved homogeneous deposition of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) from a colloidal suspension by reinforcing Marangoni flow over the internal capillary flow (Gençer et al. Langmuir 2017, 33 (1), 228-234), we now set out to reduce the importance of capillary flow inside a drying droplet by inducing gelation. In this paper, we discuss the effect of gelation on the deposition pattern and on the self-assembly of CNCs during droplet drying. CNC films were obtained by drop casting CNC suspensions containing NaCl and CaCl"
29953208," Polymer-based nanotheranostics for cancer treatment and diagnosis are appealing tools in the fast-growing field of nanomedicine. In this paper, we report on the straightforward preparation of novel engineered PEI-based nanotheranostics incorporating NIR fluorescence heptamethine cyanine dyes (NIRF-HC) to enable them with tumor targeted gene delivery capabilities. Branched PEI-2kDa (b2kPEI) is conjugated with IR-780 and IR-783 dyes by either covalent and non-covalent simple preparative methodologies varying their stoichiometry ratio. The as-prepared set of PEI-NIR-HC nanocarriers are essayed in vitro an in vivo to evaluate their gene transfection efficiency, cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, internalization and trafficking mechanisms, subcellular distribution and tumor specific gene delivery. The results show the validity of the approach particularly for one of the covalent IR783-b2kPEI conjugates that exhibit an enhanced tumor uptake, probably mediated by organic anion transporting peptides, and favorable intracellular transport to the nucleus. The compound behaves as an efficient nanotheranostic transfection agent in NSG mice bearing melanoma G361 xenographs resulting in adequate imaging signal and gene concentration in the targeted tumor. By this way, advanced nanotheranostics with multifunctional capabilities (gene delivery, tumor-specific targeting and NIR fluorescence imaging) are generated in which the NIRF-HC dye component accounts for simultaneous targeting and diagnostic avoiding additional incorporation of additional tumor-specific targeting bioligands."
29953207," Intracellular drug delivery systems are often limited by their poor serum stability and delivery efficiency. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), particularly those derived from basic protein subunits, have been studied extensively in this regard and used for the delivery of a variety of cargoes in vitro. Although promising, traditional cationic CPPs have some drawbacks that hinder their therapeutic application such as rapid proteolytic degradation and undesired interactions with the biological milieu. To overcome these limitations, this article details the discovery of a new class of non-charged cell-penetrating oligoTEAs (CPOTs) that undergo extensive and rapid cellular entry across different cell lines with low cytotoxicity. CPOTs outperform a widely used CPP, R9 peptide. This new class of highly efficient non-charged macromolecular transporters are distinct from their cationic counterparts and show strong promise for the intracellular delivery of hydrophilic small molecule therapeutics."
29953206," Low-cost transition metal oxides are actively explored as alternative materials to precious metal based electrocatalysts for challenging multistep oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We utilized Kirkendall effect allowing the formation of hollow polycrystalline, highly disordered nanoparticles (NPs) to synthesize highly active binary metal oxide OER electrocatalysts in alkali media. Two synthetic strategies were applied to achieve compositional control in binary transition metal oxide hollow NPs. The first strategy is capitalized on the oxidation of transition metal NP seeds in the presence of other transition metal cations. Oxidation of Fe NPs treated with Ni (+2) cations allowed synthesis of hollow oxide NPs with 1 to 4.7 Ni to Fe ratio via oxidation induced doping mechanism. Hollow Fe-Ni oxide NPs also reached a current density of 10 mA/cm2 at 0.30 V overpotential. The second strategy is based on the direct oxidation of iron-cobalt alloy NPs which allows the synthesis of hollow FexCo100-x-oxide NPs where x can be tuned in the range between 100 and 24. Hollow Fe36Co64- oxide NPs also revealed the current density of 10 mA/cm2 at 0.30V overpotential in 0.1 M KOH."
29953205," Engineered nanoparticles offer the chance to improve drug transport and delivery through biological barriers, exploiting the possibility to leave the blood circulation and traverse the endothelial vascular bed, blood-brain barrier (BBB) included, to reach their target. It is known that nanoparticles gather molecules on their surface upon contact with biological fluids, forming the ""protein corona"", which can affect their fate and therapeutic/diagnostic performance, yet no information on the corona's evolution across the barrier has been gathered so far. Using a cellular model of the BBB and gold nanoparticles, we show that the composition of the corona undergoes dramatic quantitative and qualitative molecular modifications during passage from the ""blood"" to the ""brain"" side, while it is stable once beyond the BBB. Thus, we demonstrate that the nanoparticle corona dynamically and drastically evolves upon crossing the BBB and that its initial composition is not predictive of nanoparticle fate and performance once beyond the barrier at the target organ."
29953204," A surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor-based active ingredients recognition system (SPR-AIRS) was developed, validated, and applied to screen signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) ligands. First, features of the screening system were investigated in four aspects: (1) specificity of the STAT3-immobilized chip, it shows that the chip could be applied to screen STAT3 ligands from complex mixture; (2) linearity and limit of detection (LOD) of the system, the minimum recovery cycle number was determined as 5 cycles; (3) saturability of the chip, the results indicate that it is necessary to select a proper concentration based on the compound's Kd value; (4) robustness of the system, it indicates that inactive compounds in the matrix could not interfere with active compounds in the process of screening. Next, SPR-AIRS was applied to screen STAT3 ligands from medicinal herbs. 9 candidate compounds were fished out. Then SPR assay and molecular docking were performed to verify the interplay between STAT3 and candidate compounds. Apoptosis assay and luciferase report assay were performed to investigate the drug effect of candidate compounds on STAT3 activity. Western blot results indicated that neobaicalein and polydatin could inhibit the phosphorylation of STAT3. As far as we know, this is the first time that neobaicalein and polydatin are reported as effective STAT3 ligands. In a conclusion, we have systemically demonstrated the feasibility of SPR biosensor-based screening method applying to complex drug systems, and our findings suggest that SPR-AIRS could be a sensitive and effective solution for the discovery of active compounds from complex matrix."
29953203," Novel oppositely charged polyphosphazene polyelectrolytes containing grafted poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains were synthesized as modular components for the assembly of biodegradable PEGylated protein delivery vehicles. These macromolecular counterparts containing either carboxylic acid or tertiary amino groups were then formulated at near physiological conditions into supramolecular assemblies of nanoscale level - below 100 nm. Nanocomplexes displayed larger size and reduced polydispersity compared to individual macromolecules, and were stable at electroneutral surface charge as assessed by zeta potential measurements in aqueous solutions suggesting their compact polyelectrolyte complex ""core"" - hydrophilic PEG ""shell"" structure. Investigation of PEGylated polyphosphazene nanocomplexes as agents for non-covalent PEGylation of therapeutic protein - L-Asparaginase (L-ASP) in vitro demonstrated their ability to dramatically reduce protein antigenicity, as well as improve its thermal stability and proteolytic resistance. All synthesized polyphosphazenes exhibited composition controlled hydrolytic degradability in aqueous solutions at neutral pH and showed greater stability at lower temperatures, indicating adequate solution shelf life. Overall, novel biodegradable polyphosphazene polyelectrolytes capable of spontaneous self-assembly into PEGylated nanoparticulates in aqueous solutions can potentially enable a simple and effective approach to modifying biologically important properties of therapeutic proteins without the need for their covalent modification."

29953201," The aggregation of α-synuclein, an intrinsically disordered protein that is highly abundant in neurons, is closely associated with the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease. We have shown previously that the aminosterol squalamine can inhibit the lipid induced initiation process in the aggregation of α-synuclein, and we report here that the related compound trodusquemine is capable of inhibiting not only this process but also the fibril-dependent secondary pathways in the aggregation reaction. We further demonstrate that trodusquemine can effectively suppress the toxicity of α-synuclein oligomers in neuronal cells, and that its administration, even after the initial growth phase, leads to a dramatic reduction in the number of α-synuclein inclusions in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of Parkinson's disease, eliminates the related muscle paralysis, and increases lifespan. On the basis of these findings, we show that trodusquemine is able to inhibit multiple events in the aggregation process of α-synuclein and hence to provide important information about the link between such events and neurodegeneration, as it is initiated and progresses. Particularly in the light of the previously reported ability of trodusquemine to cross the blood-brain barrier and to promote tissue regeneration, the present results suggest that this compound has the potential to be an important therapeutic candidate for Parkinson's disease and related disorders."
29953200," The molecular mechanism of protein aggregation is of both fundamental and clinical importance as amyloid aggregates are linked to a number of neurodegenerative disorders. Such protein aggregates include macroscopic insoluble fibrils as well as small soluble oligomeric species. Time-dependent resolution of these species is prerequisite for a detailed quantitative understanding of protein aggregation; this remains challenging due to the lack of methods for detecting and characterizing transient and heterogeneous protein oligomers. Here we have used single molecule fluorescence techniques combined with mechanistic modelling to study the heparin-induced aggregation of the repeat region of tau, which forms the core region of neurofibrillary tangles found in Alzheimer's disease. We distinguish several sub-populations of oligomers with different stability and follow their evolution during aggregation reactions as a function of temperature and concentration. Employment of techniques from chemical kinetics reveals that the two largest populations structurally distinct from fibrils; and are both kinetically and thermodynamically unstable. The first population is in rapid exchange with monomers and held together by electrostatic interactions; the second is kinetically more stable, dominates at later times and is probably off-pathway to fibril formation. These more stable oligomers may contribute to other oligomer induced effects in the cellular environment, for example by overloading protein quality control systems. We also show that the shortest growing filaments remain suspended in aqueous buffer and thus comprise a third, smaller population of transient oligomers with cross- structure. Overall our data show that a diverse population of oligomers of different structures and half-lives are formed during the aggregation reaction with the great majority of oligomers formed not going on to form fibrils."
29953199," Phencyclidine (PCP, ""angel dust"", an arylcyclohexylamine) was the first non-natural, man-made illicit drug of abuse, and was coined 'the most dangerous drug in America"" in the late 1970s (amidst sensational horror stories of the drug's effects); however, few other illicit drugs have had such a significant and broad impact on society - both good and bad. Originally developed as a new class of anesthetic, PCP-derived psychosis gave way to the PCP hypothesis of schizophrenia (later coined the NMDA receptor hypofunction hypothesis or the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia), which continues to drive therapeutic discovery for schizophrenia today. PCP also led to the discovery of ketamine (and a new paradigm for the treatment of major depression), as well as other illicit, designer drugs, such as methoxetamine (MXE) and a new wave of internet commerce for illicit drugs (sold as research chemicals, or RCs). Furthermore, PCP is a significant contaminant/additive of many illegal drugs sold today, due to its ease of preparation by clandestine chemists. Here, we will review the history, importance, synthesis (both legal and clandestine), pharmacology, drug metabolism and folklore of PCP, a true DARK classic in chemical neuroscience."
29953174," The objective of the study is to determine the usefulness of the SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment), quick SOFA (qSOFA), LODS (Logistic Organ Dysfunction System) and EWS (Early Warning Score) scores to predict in-hospital mortality among septic patients attended in the emergency department; to evaluate what factors are associated with mortality; and develop a predictive model of in-hospital mortality. Retrospective study including patients over 14 years of age included in the sepsis code of an Emergency Department of a University Hospital between November 2013 and September 2015. Demographic variables, hemodynamic and analytical variables, and in-hospital mortality were collected to obtain qSOFA, SOFA, LODS, EWS scores. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for each score. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the probability of in-hospital mortality. A total of 349 patients were analyzed, median age 72.7 (range 86), males: 54.4%. The in-hospital mortality was 21.8%. AUC obtained: LODS: 0.73 (IC 95% 0.67-0.80; p<0.001), EWS: 0.73 (IC 95% 0.65-0.81; p<0.001), SOFA: 0.72 (IC 95% 0.65- 0.78; p<0.001), qSOFA: 0.67 (IC 95% 0.58-0.76; p<0.001). After the multivariate analysis, these were the independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality: Oxygen saturation ≤92%, Glasgow coma score <14, lactate ≥2mmol/L (p<0.05). Two prognostic models were generated: MPRO1: age, oxygen saturation ≤92% and Glasgow coma score <14, AUC: 0.78 (IC 95% 0.72-0.84; p<0.001) and MPRO2 formed by the previous ones and lactate ≥2mmol/L, AUC: 0.82 (IC 95% 0.76-0.87; p<0.001). SOFA score and the new developed scores could be useful in asses the risk of in-hospital mortality in patients included in the sepsis code."
29953169," Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and alcohol use disorder (AUD) both adversely affect the immune system resulting in alterations in immune cell signaling and inflammatory processes. The aim of this study was to investigate how comorbid AUD contributes to abnormalities in inflammatory mediators and psychiatric impairments in adults with HCV. Alcohol use, mood, and inflammatory factors were evaluated at 3 time points (baseline, week 4, and week 12) in Veterans with HCV, with (n = 42) and without (n = 13) comorbid AUD. Peripheral indices of immune activation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage (S100 calcium-binding protein B [S100B]), liver function, and viral load were measured using immunoassays and polymerase chain reaction assays. Comorbid AUD was associated with increased symptoms of depression and anxiety, elevated levels of liver enzymes, and altered expression of inflammatory factors. Alcohol consumption was positively correlated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms. Univariate analysis identified significant group differences in interleukin (IL)-8 (p = 0.006), IL-10 (p = 0.03), and S100B (p = 0.048), with increased levels in participants with AUD, which persisted over time despite reductions in alcohol use and no significant change in HCV viral load. Statistically significant effects of study group or time were not found for the other immune factors assessed. Exploratory receiver operating characteristic curve analysis evaluated the ability of IL-8, IL-10, and S100B to differentiate between levels of alcohol consumption and generated biomarker cutoff values used to identify low risk and unhealthy alcohol use groups. These results demonstrate that HCV and comorbid AUD are associated with greater psychiatric impairments, potentially resulting from increased inflammation, dysregulated cytokine expression, and compromised BBB function. Alcohol-induced BBB damage may increase the risk of neuropathological consequences within the context of chronic HCV infection."
29953168," Amniotic fluid obtained via amniocentesis provides a source of fetal material used in prenatal diagnosis. The fluid may be used directly for biochemical analyses, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and isolation of DNA for molecular studies, including chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). The fluid is typically cultured as a source of metaphase cells for chromosome analysis and to provide additional material for biochemical and DNA-based testing. This unit describes an in situ method for the preparation, culture, and harvest of amniotic fluid samples for metaphase chromosome analysis. Cells are grown, harvested for metaphase spreads, and analyzed on glass coverslips. The unit also describes methods to obtain cells for additional studies (such as molecular genetic analyses) by growing cells in flasks either following passaging of cells from a glass coverslip culture or by directly establishing a flask culture from the amniotic fluid specimen. When cells are grown in flasks, they must be removed from the flask with trypsin before they can be used in studies. Lastly, this unit describes a method for isolating DNA for CMA from uncultured amniotic fluid and cultured cells. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc."
29953167," Chronic (present > 48 hours) non-hypovolaemic hyponatraemia occurs frequently, can be caused by various conditions, and is associated with shorter survival and longer hospital stays. Many treatments, such as fluid restriction or vasopressin receptor antagonists can be used to improve the hyponatraemia, but whether that translates into improved patient-important outcomes is less certain. This review aimed to 1) look at the benefits and harms of interventions for chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia when compared with placebo, no treatment or head-to-head; and 2) determine if benefits and harms vary in absolute or relative terms dependent on the specific compound within a drug class, on the dosage used, or the underlying disorder causing the hyponatraemia. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 1 December 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also screened the reference lists of potentially relevant studies, contacted authors, and screened the websites of regulatory agencies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared the effects of any intervention with placebo, no treatment, standard care, or any other intervention in patients with chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia. We also included subgroups with hyponatraemia from studies with broader inclusion criteria (e.g. people with chronic heart failure or people with cirrhosis with or without hyponatraemia), provided we could obtain outcomes for participants with hyponatraemia from the report or the study authors. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We expressed treatment effects as mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes (health-related quality of life, length of hospital stay, change from baseline in serum sodium concentration, cognitive function), and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes (death, response and rapid increase in serum sodium concentration, hypernatraemia, polyuria, hypotension, acute kidney injury, liver function abnormalities) together with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We identified 35 studies, enrolling 3429 participants. Twenty-eight studies (3189 participants) compared a vasopressin receptor antagonist versus placebo, usual care, no treatment, or fluid restriction. In adults with chronic, non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia, vasopressin receptor antagonists have uncertain effects on death at six months (15 studies, 2330 participants: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.33) due to risk of selective reporting and serious imprecision; and on health-related quality of life because results are at serious risk of performance, selective reporting and attrition bias, and suffer from indirectness related to the validity of the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) in the setting of hyponatraemia. Vasopressin receptor antagonists may reduce hospital stay (low certainty evidence due to risk of performance bias and imprecision) (3 studies, 610 participants: MD -1.63 days, 95% CI -2.96 to -0.30), and may make little or no difference to cognitive function (low certainty evidence due to indirectness and imprecision). Vasopressin receptor antagonists probably increase the intermediate outcome of serum sodium concentration (21 studies, 2641 participants: MD 4.17 mmol/L, 95% CI 3.18 to 5.16), corresponding to two and a half as many people having a 5 to 6 mmol/L increase in sodium concentration compared with placebo at 4 to 180 days (moderate certainty evidence due to risk of attrition bias) (18 studies, 2014 participants: RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.18). But they probably also increase the risk of rapid serum sodium correction - most commonly defined as > 12 mmol/L/d (moderate certainty evidence due to indirectness) (14 studies, 2058 participants: RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.40) and commonly cause side-effects such as thirst (13 studies, 1666 participants: OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.80 to 4.27) and polyuria (6 studies, 1272 participants): RR 4.69, 95% CI 1.59 to 13.85) (high certainty evidence). The potential for liver toxicity remains uncertain due to large imprecision. Effects were generally consistent across the different agents, suggesting class effect.Data for other interventions such as fluid restriction, urea, mannitol, loop diuretics, corticosteroids, demeclocycline, lithium and phenytoin were largely absent. In people with chronic hyponatraemia, vasopressin receptor antagonists modestly raise serum sodium concentration at the cost of a 3% increased risk of it being rapid. To date there is very low certainty evidence for patient-important outcomes; the effects on mortality and health-related quality of life are unclear and do not rule out appreciable benefit or harm; there does not appear to be an important effect on cognitive function, but hospital stay may be slightly shorter, although available data are limited. Treatment decisions must weigh the value of an increase in serum sodium concentration against its short-term risks and unknown effects on patient-important outcomes. Evidence for other treatments is largely absent.Further studies assessing standard treatments such as fluid restriction or urea against placebo and one-another would inform practice and are warranted. Given the limited available evidence for patient-important outcomes, any study should include these outcomes in a standardised manner."
29953166," An easily prepared iron(ii) amide precatalyst enables the selective hydroboration of carbonyls with HBpin (pinacolborane) in the absence of any additive. The reactions proceed with low catalytic loading (1-3 mol%) under mild reaction conditions and display wide functional group compatibility. Aldehydes are selectively hydroborated in the presence of other reducible functional groups, such as ketones, alkenes, nitriles, esters, amides, acids and halides."
29953165," A series of organometallic dendrons containing N,O-salicylaldimine entities at the focal point were synthesised by reacting the N,O-salicylaldimine-functionalised Fréchet dendrons (G0, G1 and G2) with a [Rh(μ-Cl)(η2:η2-COD)]2 dimer to yield the corresponding Rh(COD) [COD = cyclooctadiene] complexes. These Rh(COD) complexes were exposed to an atmosphere of CO to yield a new class of rhodium carbonyl organometallic dendrons with Rh(CO)2 units at the focal point. All the compounds were characterised using standard spectroscopic and analytical techniques, these include nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single-crystal X-ray diffraction for compounds 1, 4 and 7. All of the complexes were evaluated in the hydroformylation of 1-octene, with excellent conversion and chemoselectivity towards aldehydes. The G0-(CO)2 catalyst precursor (7) was active in the hydroformylation of 1-octene, styrene, 7-tetradecene, methyl oleate, triolein, d-limonene and R-citronellal. The conversion and chemoselectivity towards aldehydes for 7-tetradecene, methyl oleate, triolein and d-limonene were promising. Across a particular dendron series, an increase in chemoselectivity was observed due to the dendritic effect. Mercury drop tests were performed for the G0-analogues and these confirm that the hydroformylation can be attributed to a combination of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis."
29953164," We report a trinuclear mixed-valence {CoIICoIII2} complex, where the CoII centre adopts a trigonal bipyramidal geometry, leading to a large, easy-plane magnetic anisotropy and field-induced slow magnetic relaxation with a Raman-like relaxation process."
29953163," An improved density functional theory (DFT) for an inhomogeneous charged system (including electrolyte and/or polyelectrolyte) is proposed based on fundamental measure theory, thermodynamic perturbation theory and mean-spherical approximation. Our DFT combines the existing treatment of hard-sphere contributions using fundamental measure theory (FMT) with a new treatment of the electrostatic correlations for the non-bonded ions and chain connectivity that are approximated by employing a first-order Taylor expansion, with the reference fluid density determined using the technique from Gillespie et al. [D. Gillespie et al., J. Phys.: Condens. Matter, 2002, 14, 12129]. We show that the first-order Taylor expansion for the non-bonded electrostatic correlations yields numerically comparable results to the more involved second-order expansion. Furthermore, we find that the existing treatment of the chain connectivity correlation predicts a spurious layer-by-layer phase at moderately large Bjerrum lengths, which is avoided in our new treatment. These simplifications and improvements should significantly facilitate the implementation and reduce the computational cost."
29953162," Oxalic acid (OxA) is an end product in the oxidation of many organic compounds, and therefore is ubiquitous in the atmosphere and is often the most abundant organic species in ambient aerosols. To better understand the hygroscopic properties of OxA under sub- and supersaturated conditions in the atmosphere, we investigated the hygroscopic growth and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation ability of pure OxA and its salts using a hygroscopic tandem differential mobility analyzer (HTDMA) and cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNC), respectively. OxA particles absorb water under >45% RH, suggesting that the initial phase state might be an amorphous solid. The measured hygroscopic growth factor (HGF) of OxA at 90% RH was 1.47. We found that the HGF of ammonium oxalate (NH4-Ox) was larger than that of OxA, whereas HGFs of sodium, calcium, and magnesium oxalates (Na-Ox, Ca-Ox, and Mg-Ox) were smaller than that of OxA particles. Potassium oxalate (K-Ox) behaved like a typical water-soluble inorganic salt, exhibiting deliquescence and efflorescence transitions at around 85% and 50% RH, respectively. Na-Ox exhibited strong activation capabilities among all the investigated salts, followed by NH4-Ox and K-Ox as inferred from the activation ratios (CCN/CN) against supersaturations (SS). On the other hand, Ca-Ox showed moderate activation ability and Mg-Ox showed poor CCN activation ability. We also observed significantly higher κCCN values compared to κHTDMA for pure OxA and its salts (NH4-Ox and Na-Ox), suggesting that the condensation of OxA into the aqueous phase occurs during water uptake. These findings improve the fundamental understanding of hygroscopic behaviors and phase states of oxalic acid and its salts under sub- and supersaturated conditions in the atmosphere and impacts of hygroscopicity on the direct and indirect effects of aerosol particles."
29953161," A series of Fe-doped ZnS (Fex-ZnS) photocatalysts were synthesized using a one-pot hydrothermal method. The physicochemical properties of the as-prepared Fex-ZnS microspheres were characterized by different microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. Fe doping did not obviously change the morphology and crystallinity of ZnS, but effectively broadened the light response range into the visible-light region. Degradation of p-nitrophenol (PNP) was used to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the Fex-ZnS catalysts under visible light irradiation with the addition of H2O2 to facilitate photo-Fenton-like reactions. The highest PNP removal rate of 83.8% after 180 min of irradiation was achieved under the optimal conditions, including a doping ratio of 6%, a H2O2 concentration of 3 mmol L-1 and a catalyst dosage of 0.8 g L-1. The effects of aqueous/solid mass transfer and intraparticle mass transfer limitations on the PNP degradation reactions were analyzed, indicating that the variations of catalyst size caused by different Fe doping ratios did not affect the photocatalytic reactions in this study. The PNP removal mechanism of the Fex-ZnS photocatalyst with H2O2 addition under visible light irradiation was proposed."
29953160," The possibility of directed stimulation of intramolecular electron transfer between a metal and a redox-active ligand in a molecular coordination compound is the key to its application in molecular catalysis and other research themes. Although the stimulation by a substitution reaction of the co-ligands is often postulated as key step in catalytic cycles using redox-active ligands as electron reservoirs, there are only a few explicit examples for such reactions. Herein we report the synthesis of the first dicationic and dinuclear CuI complexes featuring the oxidized form of a redox-active tetrakisguanidine ligand (1,2,4,5-tetrakis(tetramethylguanidino)benzene 1) as a bridging ligand and two neutral co-ligands L (acetonitrile or pyridine), [1{Cu(Cl)L}2]2+. An intramolecular electron transfer between the copper atom and the tetrakisguanidine ligand 1, leading to a dinuclear CuII complex with the reduced form of the tetrakisguanidine ligand 1, is triggered by substitution of the neutral co-ligands L."
29953159," Development of functional nanofluidic devices requires understanding the fundamentals of capillary driven flow in nanochannels. In this context, we conduct molecular dynamics simulations of water capillary imbibition in silica nanoslits under externally applied electric (E) fields with strengths between 0 and 1 V nm-1. For increasing E-fields, we observe a systematic lowering in the meniscus contact angle and a decrease in the corresponding water filling rates. These results contrast markedly the classical Washburn-Bosanquet's equation which predicts an increase in filling rates for lower water contact angles. Our study provides evidence that the observed decrease in water filling rates can be attributed to the interplay between two underlying mechanisms, a reduced fluidity of interfacial water and a systematic alignment of the water molecules in the bulk as a response to the particular strength of the applied E-field. Therefore, during water capillary filling a constant E-field applied in the direction parallel to the water imbibition leads to a lower than expected filling rate caused by a viscosity increase in the bulk and an altered solid-liquid friction on the channel walls. These coupled mechanisms governing capillarity under the action of applied E-fields could be manipulated for controlling imbibition of polar liquid solutions in nanofluidic devices."
29953158," 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) is the most abundant mutagen/carcinogen produced in high temperature treated protein food. Quercetin has been shown to inhibit PhIP formation by trapping phenylacetaldehyde to form two human beneficial adducts 6-C-(E-phenylethenyl)quercetin (6-CEPQ) and 8-C-(E-phenylethenyl)quercetin (8-CEPQ). Here we studied the formation of PhIP as well as the phenylacetaldehyde-trapping ability of quercetin in microwave heating and conventional heating systems. LC-MS was applied for the comparison of PhIP formed in chemical models using microwave heating and conductive heating. Results showed that PhIP was produced time dependently under both heating conditions. Microwave heating produced a smaller amount of PhIP compared with conductive heating. Moreover, quercetin showed a more potent inhibitory effect on PhIP formation in microwave heating systems than in conductive heating models. The amount of 6-CEPQ and 8-CEPQ produced in chemical models and onion/beef soup using microwave heating was about 5 and 1.5 times more than using conductive heating, respectively. Our results demonstrate that microwave heating was a much safer and healthier thermal processing technology than conventional heating in terms of formation of less mutagenic PhIP and production of more human beneficial compounds 6-CEPQ and 8-CEPQ."
29953157," The current status of the use of core-shell rare-earth-doped nanoparticles in biomedical applications is reviewed in detail. The different core-shell rare-earth-doped nanoparticles developed so far are described and the most relevant examples of their application in imaging, sensing, and therapy are summarized. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages they present are discussed. Finally, a critical opinion of their potential application in real life biomedicine is given."
29953156," X-ray absorption spectra (XAS), the density of states (DOS) and the electron density distribution of the HOMO and LUMO for flat and twisted rubrene molecules have been calculated using density functional theory (DFT). The simulated XAS spectra are validated by experimental C K-edge near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) data. We demonstrate that the NEXAFS spectra of rubrene thin films of different thicknesses can be explained in terms of different combinations of spectral intensity from the twisted and the flat randomly oriented molecules. All the fine structure of the NEXAFS spectra is well reproduced and the energetic positions of the resonances agree within a window of ±0.3 eV with the calculated XAS. Our calculation reveals that the peak at lowest photon energy (α') of the NEXAFS spectra at the lower coverage of rubrene molecules appears only from the twisted molecules. Other peaks in the case of the flat molecules appear either from the backbone or the wings, whereas, for the twisted molecules, the backbone and the wings contribute somewhat equally. Lowering of the HOMO-LUMO gap, as well as redistribution of the electron density of both the frontier orbitals, is found to take place in the case of the twisted molecule. The redistribution explains the reduction in conductivity for the twisted molecule compared to the flat one despite the lower band gap for the former. This finding will further strengthen the progress of rubrene thin film based devices."
29953155," The lattice quality of strain superlattice structures in Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCLs) directly influences the photoelectric properties and service life of the lasers. However, the evaluation method for lattice quality on the nanoscale is not very well developed at present, especially for interface lattice quality assessment. In this investigation, all atoms positioned in the multiple interface layers can be simultaneously and accurately determined through Subset Geometric Phase Analysis (S-GPA) combined with a Peak Finding (PF) method and an Optimal Approximation Algorithm (OAA) with a sensitivity of about 0.04 Å. Based on the determined interface location, the strain distribution in all layers of the superlattice structure was simultaneously measured using the improved S-GPA by means of the optimal selection of multiple reference areas. A quantitative evaluation of the strain/stress compensation effect was then carried out based on the theoretical model of elastic mechanics. The proposed method was successfully applied to evaluating the lattice quality of an In0.6Ga0.4As/In0.44Al0.56As superlattice structure grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE). The obtained results show that the interface lattices are almost perfect with a uniform thickness of layers, without any defects and stress concentration. Each In0.44Al0.56As layer and adjacent In0.6Ga0.4As layers provided effective strain/stress compensation for each other, reducing the possibility of forming dislocations. In one period, the active region has been properly strain-balanced to give a nearly net zero strain. The proposed method can not only be applied in evaluating the growth quality of the superlattice structure with a large field of view, but also provide quantitative experimental data for further improving the superlattice design."
29953154," α-Mangostin (αMN) is a xanthone present in the pericarp of Garcinia mangostana Linn. which is mentioned in Ayurveda and is a widely used functional food supplement. However, its anti-inflammatory mechanism is not well studied. Hence, we used in silico, in vitro and in vivo models to provide information of the mechanism on how αMN could prevent inflammation. Firstly, molecular docking was used to find out the binding energy of αMN with NFκB and COX proteins. Secondly, LPS induced RAW 264.7 cells were used to measure the production of cytokines, the prevention of translocation of NFκB and the inhibition of COX-1 and -2 enzymes. Finally, carrageenan-induced peritonitis was used in vivo to check cytokine release, leukocyte migration and vascular permeability. The in silico modelling had showed that αMN has the lowest binding energy with COX-2 and NFκB proteins. αMN has been found to inhibit the production of PGE2 and nitric oxide, and iNOS protein expression. TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines were inhibited significantly (p < 0.05) at 8 and 14 μg ml-1 concentration. αMN at higher doses inhibits the translocation of NFκB together with suppressing the COX-2 enzymes, but not COX-1. αMN inhibited the total leukocyte migration, predominantly, neutrophils in vivo. The level of TNFα and IL-1β was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in the peritoneal fluids as measured by ELISA analysis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that αMN acts well as an anti-inflammatory agent via inhibiting the hallmark mechanisms of inflammation. It can be considered as a potential alternative lead compound. In addition, the current results support the traditional use of this fruit pericarp as a functional food."
29953153," The enantioselective synthesis of spirocycles has long been pursued by organic chemists. Despite their unique 3D properties and presence in several natural products, the difficulty in their enantioselective synthesis makes them underrepresented in pharmaceutical libraries. Since the first pioneering reports of the enantioselective construction of spirosilanes by Tamao et al., significant effort has been devoted towards the development of new promising asymmetric methodologies. Remarkably, with the advent of organocatalysis, particularly over six years, the reported methodologies for the synthesis of spirocycles have increased exponentially. The aim of this review is to summarize the latest trends and developments in the enantioselective synthesis of spirocompounds during these last six years."
29953152," Virtually all organisms require iron and have evolved to obtain this element in free or chelated forms. Under anaerobic or low pH conditions commonly encountered by numerous pathogens, iron predominantly exists in the ferrous (Fe2+) form. The ferrous iron transport (Feo) system is the only widespread mechanism dedicated solely to bacterial ferrous iron import, and this system has been linked to pathogenic virulence, bacterial colonization, and microbial survival. The canonical feo operon encodes for three proteins that comprise the Feo system: FeoA, a small cytoplasmic β-barrel protein; FeoB, a large, polytopic membrane protein with a soluble G-protein domain capable of hydrolyzing GTP; and FeoC, a small, cytoplasmic protein containing a winged-helix motif. While previous studies have revealed insight into soluble and fragmentary domains of the Feo system, the chief membrane-bound component FeoB remains poorly studied. However, recent advances have demonstrated that large quantities of intact FeoB can be overexpressed, purified, and biophysically characterized, revealing glimpses into FeoB function. Two models of full-length FeoB have been published, providing starting points for hypothesis-driven investigations into the mechanism of FeoB-mediated ferrous iron transport. Finally, in vivo studies have begun to shed light on how this system functions as a unique multicomponent complex. In light of these new data, this review will summarize what is known about the Feo system, including recent advancements in FeoB structure and function."
29953146," The dynamics of solvated molecules at the solid/liquid interface is essential for a molecular-level understanding for the solution thermodynamics in reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). The heterogeneous nature of the systems and the competing intermolecular interactions makes solute retention in RPLC a surprisingly challenging problem which benefits greatly from modelling at atomistic resolution. However, the quality of the underlying computational model needs to be sufficiently accurate to provide a realistic description of the energetics and dynamics of systems, especially for solution-phase simulations. Here, the retention thermodynamics and the retention mechanism of a range of benzene-derivatives in C18 stationary-phase chains in contact with water/methanol mixtures is studied using point charge (PC) and multipole (MTP) electrostatic models. The results demonstrate that free energy simulations with a faithful MTP representation of the computational model provide quantitative and molecular level insight into the thermodynamics of adsorption/desorption in chromatographic systems while a conventional PC representation fails in doing so. This provides a rational basis to develop more quantitative and validated models for the optimization of separation systems."
29953145, meso-Ethynyl extended aryl-picket calix[4]pyrroles 2 and 3 are designed and synthesized by directly anchoring arylethynyl groups at diametrically opposed meso-positions. The critical roles of direct ethynyl linkers are manifested through the isolation of unexpected host-anion conformers of meso-arylethynyl calix[4]pyrroles and a significant enhancement in halide binding affinities.
29953144," A hierarchically core/shell-structured TS-1@silica/carbon composite material, synthesized from titanosilicate crystals and surfactant-mediated mesosilica/resol precursors via a self-assembly and nanocasting route, was fabricated to produce stable oil-water-solid Pickering emulsions in alkene/H2O2 media, exhibiting attractive interfacial activity and stability for selective epoxidation of alkenes."
29953143," Nanoassemblies formed via self-assembly based on colloidal CdSe quantum dots (QDs) and porphyrin (H2P) dye molecules show Fluorescence Resonant Energy Transfer (FRET) and non-FRET quenching of QD photoluminescence (PL). We present a procedure to unravel and quantify these two relaxation pathways via dynamic and static PL quenching experiments. Accordingly, FRET amounts at maximum to 10% of the total quenching efficiency. Since the degree of ligand coverage is inhomogeneously distributed across the QD ensemble PL quantum yields vary broadly. The attachment of H2P molecules occurs preferentially to those QDs with low ligand coverage. Along with that, nanoassembly formation deviates strongly from Poisson statistics. Like FRET, non-FRET depends on the QD size. We assign non-FRET quenching to the formation of specific new Cd2+ trap states following depletion of several ligands by the spacious dye molecules. While FRET follows quantitatively the Förster model, non-FRET appears on time scales of 1-3 ns in new and enhanced non-radiative near-band-edge QD PL decay channels caused by a trapping of the electrons in long-lived intra-gap states which then manifests itself in a subsequent weak PL emission. We assign the related intra-band emission to a recombination of deep-trap electrons and shallow-trap holes."
29953142," The ground state and energetically low structures of neutral SinBm clusters, of medium size with n = 11-13, m = 1-3, are identified, presented and rationalized. Structures of the nanoclusters are predicted using density functional theory (DFT) and employing the HSE06 range-separated hybrid exchange-correlation functional. For these systems the functional is shown to offer systematic performance when benchmarked against high accuracy coupled-cluster CCSD(T) and compared to well known functionals used in the literature. Discrepancies for small size systems present in the literature are addressed and resolved. The structural evolution patterns of the clusters are discussed and common structural features (substructures) are identified. Cluster geometries are extensively searched via a particle swarm optimization algorithm alongside more traditional methodologies. In addition to the binding energies (that include zero-point energy corrections) of the structures, the optical gaps and UV/visible absorption spectra are reported, employing the CAM-B3LYP functional that was benchmarked against the high level EOM-CCSD level of theory. The computed infrared spectra are provided and discussed in length with respect to structural details. Their effectiveness as charge transfer units is examined. Optical gaps range between 1.4-2.5 eV, and are adjustable through the boron and silicon content of the clusters, which, along with the increased structural stability, offers promise for applications in optoelectronics."
29953141," In the reaction of [RuHClP3] (P = PPh3) with NaOMe in methanol, the product is [RuH2(CO)P3]. Short reaction times show that the final product is formed through [RuH4P3] as the major intermediate. Using NaOCD3 in CD3OD, the first formed product is [RuH4P'3] (P' is PPh3 partially deuterated in the ortho positions of the aromatic rings). Further reaction leads to a mixture of [RuHnD2-n(CO)P3] (n = 0, 22%; n = 1, 2 isomers each 28%; n = 2, 22%). Mechanistic aspects of both steps of the reaction are explored and, together with previously published calculations, they provide definitive mechanisms for both dehydrogenation and decarbonylation in these interesting systems."
29953140," Atomically thin Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (JTMDs) with an asymmetric structure have emerged as a new class of intriguing two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor materials. Using state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically investigate the structural, electronic, and optical properties of JTMD monolayers and heterostructures. Our calculated results indicate that the JTMD monolayers suffer from a bending strain but present high thermodynamic stability. All of them are semiconductors with a band-gap range from 1.37 to 1.96 eV. They possess pronounced optical absorption in the visible-light region and cover a large range of carrier mobilities from 28 to 606 cm2 V-1 s-1, indicating strong anisotropic characteristics. Significantly, some monolayer JTMDs (e.g., WSSe and WSeTe) exhibit superior mobilities than conventional TMD monolayers, such as MoS2. Moreover, the absolute band-edge positions of the JTMD monolayers are higher than the water redox potential, and most JTMD heterostructures have a type-II band alignment that contributes to the separation of carriers. Our work suggests that the 2D JTMD monolayers are promising for nanoelectronic, optoelectronic, and photocatalytic applications."
29953139," Unlike conventional approaches that require bulky and expensive pumping equipment, herein, we present a simple method for self-activated microdroplet generation and transport inside a long microchannel. The high gas-pressure in the syringes is used to provide the built-in power of self-priming so that the continuous phase and the dispersed phase are sequentially automated into the generator junction to produce stabilized droplets. The volume ratio between the aqueous and oil phases can be adjusted in a flexible way by accurately controlling the volume of the compressed air in the two syringes, and a novel self-activated micropumping mechanism is introduced to explain this phenomenon. Through the flow rate test inside the microchannels under different conditions, it is found that the flow rate of microdroplets inside the Teflon microchannel is highly stable. As a proof of concept, this novel micropump is applied for a 3D spiral chip for flow through PCR. It is demonstrated that this self-activated micropump is acceptable for droplet-based continuous flow microfluidic PCR with the thermal-cycle controlled by a single thermostatic heater, while the real-time (RT) fluorescence signal is comparable to a commercial qPCR cycler. This self-activated, portable, and controllable droplet generator would extend the droplet-based applications to in-field analysis and facilitate the exploitation of droplet microfluidics by non-technical users."

25250577," Terrorism is often construed as a well-thought-out, extreme form of violence to perceived injustices. The after effects of terrorism are usually reported without understanding the underlying psychological and social determinants of the terrorist act. Since '9/11' Pakistan has been at the epicentre of both terrorism and the war against it. This special paper helps to explain the psychosocial perspective of terrorism in Pakistan that leads to violent radicalisation. It identifies the terrorist acts in the background of Pakistan's history, current geopolitical and social scenario. The findings may also act as a guide on addressing this core issue."
24029840," St Lucia is a small island in the eastern Caribbean with a population of approximately 200 000 people. Although St Lucia is formally ranked as a high middle-income country, there are pockets of deprivation and relatively low living standards. Mental health services in St Lucia have increased considerably and advanced over recent years because of a coalition between the government of the island and South East Asian partners. The National Mental Wellness Centre opened several years ago and has much improved facilities. There remains a significant shortage of community-based services, no mental health law, and a pervasive community stigma and apprehension regarding those with mental health problems."
27117326," Our current understanding of autism and other developmental disorders is primarily based on research conducted in high-income countries, predominantly in North America and Europe. Even within high-income countries, White participants are overrepresented in autism research. There is now increased recognition that a more global and diverse research representation is warranted. This paper argues that in order for global and diverse research efforts to be effective, it is essential to collaborate and engage with local experts and stakeholders, including local researchers, clinicians and representatives from governmental and non-governmental organisations. Such collaborations ensure that studies use culturally appropriate methods and materials, and that research findings are interpreted taking local context into account. Ultimately, these collaborations build local capacity and foster the development of culturally and contextually appropriate interventions that address locally perceived needs. The adage 'nothing about us without us' is vital to global autism research."

29953130," Owing to the relatively small population sizes and remoteness of the Small Island Development States (SIDS), their mental health systems face many common difficulties. These include having few mental health specialists per country, limited access to mental health services and low awareness. To overcome these limitations, the World Health Organization (WHO) Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), which aims to decrease the treatment gap by training non-specialists, was implemented in more than 20 Pacific and English-speaking Caribbean countries. Many lessons were learnt from the experience. Mental health specialist support is crucial, and online training and supervision could be a solution. mhGAP training proved to be effective to improve knowledge and attitude, but close monitoring and supervision are needed to change clinical practice. Awareness raising and mental health service capacity building need to occur simultaneously. To realise sustainable development goals, countries need to invest more in mental health, especially in human resources; mhGAP will be one effective solution."
20660823," Relapsed Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive lymphoid malignancy with a poor prognosis and no randomized studies demonstrating superiority of any single salvage regimen. We present the case of a 33-year-old woman with relapsed Ph positive precursor (pre) B-cell ALL with rapidly rising peripheral blasts while on blinatumomab monotherapy initially, but ultimately responded with the addition of Vincristine Sulfate Liposome Injection (VSLI). Ponatinib was added later when it became available for the patient, and she ultimately achieved a complete remission. Further study is warranted to explore mechanisms of potential synergy, and the safety and efficacy of the combination of blinatumomab and VSLI."

21311729, We present a shape matching approach for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time course and spectral alignment. We use ideas from differential geometry and functional data analysis to define a functional representation for fMRI signals. The space of fMRI functions is then equipped with a reparameterization invariant Riemannian metric that enables elastic alignment of both amplitude and phase of the fMRI time courses as well as their power spectral densities. Experimental results show significant increases in pairwise node to node correlations and coherences following alignment. We apply this method for finding group differences in connectivity between patients with major depression and healthy controls.
29953125," France is known as one of the countries where psychoanalysis still holds an important position in various fields, and specially in psychiatry. Is it a 'culture bound syndrome' of French society, or, more seriously, a particularity that could be useful in other contexts as well? Through consideration of the role psychoanalysis is playing in French psychiatry, this paper will try to review this particularity and its interactions with the organisation and values of psychiatry in France, both in the public services and in private practice."

17906061," Nigeria has poorly structured services for correctional mental health driven by a mix of socioeconomic and legal factors. The archaic asylum systems established in the early part of the 20th century under the Lunacy ordinance of 1916 are no longer fit for purpose. The present strategy is to provide mental healthcare for mentally abnormal offenders within some prisons in the country. The current models for this are poorly staffed and underfunded. Adoption of task-shifting approaches based on evidence-based strategies within the context of professional innovation, government commitment and international collaboration should help to develop and sustain the needed correctional psychiatry services."

22941189," Despite extensive research no meaningful progress in systemic treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been made in the past decades. Earlier attempts with immunotherapy including interferon and vaccination approaches had limited success. High mutational load, smoking history and potentially also the frequent presence of paraneoplastic phenomena-indicating an activated immune system-represent a rationale for a benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors in SCLC. However, the likelihood of response is diminished due to poor T-cell activation resulting from low expression of MHC class I antigens, low amounts of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and low PD-L1 expression rates. Recently, early reports from studies with checkpoint inhibitors have shown promising results with the potential for long term disease control in a subset of SCLC patients. However, reliable predictive biomarkers to better define the population drawing most benefit are currently lacking. Results from ongoing phase III trials in different treatment lines and in the maintenance setting are eagerly awaited."
29953113," The aim of the study was to determine attenuation of earplugs for ultrasonic noise in the frequency range of 10-16 kHz. The attenuation of earplugs in 1/3-octave-bands with the centre frequencies of 10 kHz, 12.5 kHz, and 16 kHz using the REAT (real-ear attenuation at threshold) method based on the measurements of hearing threshold of subjects. The study was carried out for 29 models of earplugs commonly used in the industry designed by various manufacturers, including 13 models of foam earplugs, 10 models of flanged earplugs, 5 models of headband earplugs and one model of no-roll earplugs. The values of the measured attenuation of earplugs are in the range 12.9-33.2 dB for the 10 kHz frequency band, 22.8-35.2 dB for the 12.5 kHz frequency band and 29.5-37.2 dB for the 16 kHz frequency band. The attenuation of earplugs in the frequency range 10-16 kHz has higher values (statistically significant changes) for foam earplugs than flanged earplugs (p = 0.0003 vs. p = 0.0006) or headband earplugs (p = 0.0002 vs. p = 0.04). The tests indicated that there is no uniform relation between the sound attenuation in the frequencies range of 10-16 kH and the catalogue H parameter (high-frequency attenuation value) of earplugs. Therefore, it is not possible to easily predict the attenuation of ultrasonic noise in the frequency range of 10-16 kHz using the sound attenuation data for the normally considered frequency range (up to 8 kHz).

29953105," The study included 160 patients with end stage knee osteoarthritis hospitalized for primary uncomplicated TKA. There were 142 women and 18 men (mean age 66.5 and 65.4 years respectively). In the control group (n=100) standard protocol of perioperative pain management was applied, in the main group (n=60) - original multimodal approach including patient's education in order to increase his awareness and to reduce anxiety on the preoperative stage, modified surgical technique (optimization of incision length, 'sliding window' principle, tourniquet during the whole procedure until applying of compressive dressing, no drains and local infiltration analgesia) and double-level postoperative analgesia. Different factors of pain syndrome were assessed before surgery by using of specialized tests, while the dynamics of early postoperative pain characteristics were evaluated by individual diaries. Despite decrease of pain syndrome in both groups within 3 days after TKA in the main group these changes were significantly better (p<0.05). On the first postoperative day 42 (70%) patients in the main group had not pain at rest, while in the control group such cases were absent (р<0.001). There was 2-fold increase of hours of moderate/severe pain per day in the control group compared with the main group (р<0.001). No specific complications were identified in both groups during follow-up. Original multimodal perioperative approach to analgesia proved its efficiency in patients undergoing primary TKA compared with conventional one and may be safely used in clinical practice."

29953099," To determine the safest and the most effective surgical treatment of patients with cicatricle stenosis of tracheolaryngeal segment via analysis of different approaches. For the period 1963-2015 at Petrovsky Russian Research Center for Surgery and Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University 1128 patients with cicatricle tracheal stenosis have been treated. There were 683 men and 445 women. 684 (60.6%) patients were young and the most employable (21-50 years). All patients were divided into 2 groups depending on time of treatment: the first one included 297 patients between 1963 and 2000, the second group - 831 patients between 2001 and 2015. In group 1 tracheolaryngeal anastomosis was made in 10 (16.9%) out of 59 patients who underwent tracheal resection. Previously indication for this surgery was cicatricle stenosis of cervical trachea and larynx with upper borderline of cicatricle changes at least 2 cm from vocal folds. In group 2 these procedures were more frequent. 94 (28.5%) out of 330 patients underwent tracheolaryngeal resection. Cranial borderline of lesion was within 0.5 cm from the vocal folds (only if posterior laryngeal wall at the level of cricoid cartilage was intact). Difficult patients are those who need for double-level or redo repair and procedures with tracheostomy. In the second group overall morbidity after tracheal resections followed by anastomosis was 5.6%. These complications were more common after tracheolaryngeal anastomosis (17%). There were no lethal outcomes after 94 tracheolaryngeal resections. Good long-term results were observed in 89.8% of patients after circular resection. Their quality of life was similar to that of healthy people. Preserved cicatricle tracheal segments during tracheal repair with T-shaped airway tube adversely affects quality of life in these patients in long-term period."
29953098," Show the possibility of an alternative use of interventional radiology techniques in complex treatment of patients with inflammatory complications of the diverticular disease of the colon. In 2012-2016, there were 87 patients under our supervision with complicated diverticular disease. In 57 (65.5%) cases were diagnosed infiltrate, in 24 (27.6%) cases - abscess of paracolon area (Ib-II type by Hinchey), in 6 (6.9%) cases (III-IV type according Hinchey) generalized peritonitis have been identified. Emergency laparotomy was performed in 13 patients. Abscesses of paracolon (Ib-II type by Hinchey) area were diagnosed sonographically during the initial examination in 17 patients. 26 percutaneous drainage of diverticulogenous abscesses of different localizations self-locking drainage #8Fr 'pig tail' was carried out under the combined ultrasonic and X-ray control in this group of patients. The technical success of percutaneous drainaging of the abscesses was achieved in all manipulations. 13 patients had a single drainaging, and for diverticular disease - disease-free during the observation period of 1 year to 5 years. Resection of the colon in a planned manner after percutaneous drainage of recurrent abscess of paracolon area was performed in 4 patients. Complications related with the technique of installing drainage were not reported, mortality in the group of drained patients was absent. Ultrasound examination of patients with suspected inflammatory complications of diverticular disease - a necessary and sufficient method for initial diagnosis of the disease.

29953092," Rosacea is a multifactorial chronic inflammatory disease with various clinical manifestations. Primarily it is seen as a dermatological condition, but it's not uncommon for it to develop ophthalmological implications affecting eyelids, cornea and conjunctiva. The article describes main aspects of its etiopathogenesis, variations in its clinical course and treatment approaches. There is currently no universal treatment strategy for the disease due to its varying clinical manifestation, particularly of its ophthalmological form, differing severity of the pathological process, lack of knowledge about its etiology and pathogenesis. Leading role in its pathological process belongs to disturbance of regulatory mechanisms of the vascular, immune and nervous systems. Additionally, higher levels of metalloproteinases and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can be observed. Possible influence of a range of micro-organisms also hasn't been excluded. Basic therapy involves both systemic and topical drugs. The first include tetracycline antibiotics. A new direction in Rosacea treatment that aims at structural and functional restoration of vascular endothelium, improvement of microcirculation and recovery of rheological properties of blood is angioprotector therapy, in particular with Calcium Dobesilate (Doxi-Hem). Aside from systemic drugs, the ophthalmological forms of Rosacea are treated topically with anti-inflammatory preparations, immunosuppressants and artificial tears that are chosen depending on the symptoms' severity. In cases with heavy corneal damage, various types of keratoplasty can be performed. Collaboration between ophthalmology and dermatology specialists is necessary in order to choose adequate strategy for Rosacea treatment."
29953091," Facial nerve palsy is a common pathology that develops due to various diseases, traumas and medical interventions. The most common peripheral type of facial paralysis leads to acute unilateral involvement of facial muscles along with the development of paralytic lagophthalmos. The absence of adequate and timely medical treatment in patients with paralytic lagophthalmos can lead to severe corneal complications such as cornea perforation causing loss of eye and consequently restricted professional ability, work capacity and significant decrease of patient's life quality. Patients with paralytic lagophthalmos require timely, complex, planned treatment involving various correction methods aimed at protection of the cornea, as well as anatomical and functional recovery of the eyelids. Chemodenervation of the upper eyelid muscles is a pathogenetically substantiated method that can help restore the protective function of the upper eyelid and prevent corneal complications; it can be recommended for early stages of the disease."

29953089," Pseudophakic cystoid macular edema (CMO) known to appear in 0.1-2.35% of patients after phacoemulsification is one of the common causes of vision decrease during postoperative period. The authors analyzed a case of CMO development in a pseudophakic patient diagnosed 7 months after uncomplicated phacoemulsification. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was suggested for patients with low vision and a sensation of shroud before the eye for early diagnosis of pathological process. Intravitreal injection of the 0.7 mg dexamethasone micro-implant performed soon after establishing the diagnosis was proved to be viable for postoperative CMO arrest in patients without previous treatment. One month after intravitreal implant injection, the visual acuity in the patient's eye improved from 0.4 to 0.7, and retinal thickness in the macular area decreased from 705 to 255 μm. The result remained stable for 10 months. Intravitreal micro-implant appeared to have higher efficiency in contrast with traditional treatment methods (according to literature data), which was attributed to direct drug delivery to the area of pathological process. The use of 0.7 mg dexamethasone implant did not increase the intraocular pressure indicating its potential viability for patients with compensated glaucoma."
29953088," Prevention and treatment of cataract surgery complications in patients with lens subluxation remains one of the current problems of phaco surgeries. To develop and to test the surgical technique for reimplantation of in-the-bag dislocated intraocular lenses (IOL) or sulcus-fixated IOL. Surgical outcomes of 150 patients (150 eyes) with in-the-bag IOL dislocation (122 eyes) or sulcus fixated IOL dislocation (28 eyes) were analyzed. The follow-up period lasted 1-3 years. In all cases the dislocated IOL was removed and retropupillary iris-claw 'Artisan' IOL implantation was performed. After the IOL exchange, visual acuity improved in all patients, while the fixation of retropupillary IOL remained stable. This surgical technique of dislocated IOL exchange coupled with retropupillary implantation of 'Artisan' IOL provides reliable anatomic and functional results."
29953087," The phenomenon of dome-shaped macula (DSM) constitutes protrusion of membranes of the posterior pole of the eye toward the vitreous body due to local thickening of sclera layers. The phenomenon was detected using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT). In uncomplicated forms of DSM, all layers of the retina are contiguous, but the setting of DSM can involve a number of pathological conditions causing decrease in vision. One of the most often described concurrent conditions in DSM is serous retinal detachment (SRD). Such complicated forms of DSM are often masked as a non-pigmented neoplasm of the choroid, in particular hemangioma (HC). To demonstrate the possibilities of differential diagnostics of DSM with HC using modern instrumental diagnostic methods. The study involved two clinical cases of patients with DSM and HC, who underwent comprehensive ophthalmological examination including EDI-OCT and OCT angiography, fluorescent angiography (FA), indocyanine-green angiography (ICG) and magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits (MRI). The most simple and highly informative method for differential diagnostic of DSM with HC is currently EDI-OCT. In difficult differential diagnostic cases, it is recommended to use FA and MRI. Additionally, for identification of the cause of SRD in DSM, OCT-angiography and ICG-angiography can be used. Thus, diagnostics of DSM is difficult today primarily because of the low awareness of ophthalmologists about the presence of such macula pathology. Detection of this anatomical feature by means of ophthalmoscopy alone can be difficult and requires special skills and experience. The use of EDI-OCT, as well as FA and MRI in difficult differential diagnostic cases, and correct interpretation of the obtained data can help avoid diagnostic errors."

29953085," Serous retinal detachment is a rare postoperative complication of phacoemulsification with intracameral antibiotics. Diagnostic and therapeutic strategy in such cases is not well known. To present a case of serous retinal detachment after phacoemulsification with intracameral cefuroxime. A retrospective analysis of the medical record of one patient who had underwent cataract phacoemulsification on both eyes; the follow-up period was 5 months. Phacoemulsification of noncomplicated cataract with implantation of intraocular lens in the right eye was completed uneventfully; 1 mg of cefuroxime was administered into the anterior chamber at the end of the surgery. In the first day after the surgery visual acuity decreased to 0.2. Serous detachment of retinal pigment and sensory epithelia in the macula area was revealed by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Fluorescein angiography showed no pathological vascular activity. The patient received standard post-surgery therapy supplemented with subtenon triamcinolone, intravenous dexamethasone injections and systemic acetazolamide ingestion. The retinal detachment status was monitored daily by OCT. By day 6 of the follow-up visual acuity recovered to 1.0. After 5 months, inner retinal profile deformation was revealed. The patient's left eye was considered the 'control' eye; phacoemulsification without cefuroxime was performed on it 5 months after the initial surgery, and no complication occurred during the follow-up. Serous detachment of retinal pigment and sensory epithelia during the early postoperative period after cataract surgery may be caused by a toxic reaction to intracameral cefuroxime even when it's administered in standard dosage. This complication has a favorable prognosis, but requires long term monitoring."
29953084, To analyze the results of femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) and conventional phacoemulsification cataract surgery (CPCS) in patients with 1-2 degree lens subluxation. The follow-up involved 86 patients (89 eyes). The 1 At day four of the follow-up central corneal thickness was significantly lower after FLACS (p FLACS is the safer and more effective surgery choice for patients with 1-2 degree lens subluxation in comparison with CPCS; it decreases the risk of possible complications and provides faster postoperative rehabilitation.
29953083," The anterior capsular contraction syndrome (ACCS) in pseudophakic patients is known to be accompanied by postoperative opacity of anterior lens capsule (ALC) and partial or full closure of anterior capsulotomy opening. To perform complex morphological assessment of ALC in patients with ACCS. The study involved complex analysis of ALC that was removed due to ACCS in the pseudophakic eye in the setting of diabetes mellitus and past vitreoretinal surgery. The following examination methods were used: light-optical microscopy of ALC samples in the form of polychrome-colored semifine sections using optical microscope Leica DM-2500 (Germany), scanning microscopy of ALC surface with EVO LS10 (Carl Zeiss, Germany) microscope, analysis of chemical element composition and its variation of the ALC sample with energy-dispersive spectrometer Oxford X-Max50 (Oxford, UK). Light-optical microscopy showed altered state and plication of ALC induced by proliferation from inner surface of the fibrocellular tissue, which gradually thickens (up to 360 µm) towards center and causes reduction of anterior capsulotomy opening. Scanning electron microscopy revealed presence of tissue with uneven micro-relief and a porous three-dimensional structure uncharacteristic for capsule on the surface of ALC. Thickness of the fibrous deposition significantly exceeded the thickness of ALC. Evaluation of elemental composition of the fibrocellular tissue showed elevated concentration of sulfur and phosphorus, which indicates high activity of the regenerative process. In the observed case, the regenerative process was of substitute nature because an attempt to restore the lens was accompanied by formation of connective tissue structurally different from original. Complex assessment of an isolated ALC sample allowed revelation of the chain of pathological processes accompanying the development of ACCS."
29953082," to assess the possibilities of reducing the cytotoxic effect of benzalkonium chloride (a preservative used in ophthalmic hypotensive drugs) with the help of tear replacement therapy. The study included 28 patients (56 eyes) who had been using antiglaucomatous drugs containing benzalkonium chloride as a preservative for various periods (from 2 months to 17 years). The examination was performed in the setting of compensated IOP. In addition to hypotensive topical medication regimen, all patients were prescribed Stilavit eye drops. Subjects were examined prior to the prescription of artificial tears and after 1, 3 and 6 months of its usage. Effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated with biomicroscopy, Norn's test, Jones test, tearscopy, OCT-meniscometry, confocal microscopy, and impression cytology. The use of 'Stilavit' artificial tears in combination with antiglaucoma drugs led to an improvement of the corneal epithelium condition in 85% of cases, a statistically significant increase in the mean values of precorneal tear film rupture time after 1, 3 and 6 months by 26%, 61.2% and 85.8% respectively. Maximum increase of main tear production level was achieved after 3 months of treatment (increased by 43.5%), and was accompanied by 18.6% rise of the lower tear meniscus height after 3 months; in 6 months it raised by 29.4%. A tendency for restoration of the lipid layer of the tear film was observed. According to confocal microscopy and impression cytology, positive dynamics in the condition of corneal epithelium and conjunctival epithelial layer were present. The study results justify the use of tear replacement therapy, in particular the tear substitute Stilavit, as an additional protective agent for glaucoma treatment regimen."
29953081," When the lens swells, a liquefied lenticular substance that increases intralenticular pressure accumulates in the lens bag making it difficult to perform standard capsulorhexis. Thus, determination of the intralenticular pressure value is of great importance for safe intumescent cataract phacoemulsification. To develop a technology for intralenticular pressure measurement in patients with intumescent cataract and to construct a mathematical model for its prognosis according to preoperative examination data. Intralenticular pressure was measured in 11 eyes with intumescent cataract. Before that, the following parameters of the anterior compartment of the eye were examined: anterior chamber depth, lens thickness according to ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), hypoechogenic layer (the anterior layer of liquefied lenticular masses), equatorial angle. The intraoperative technology of the intralenticular pressure measurement was developed. The direct dependency between thickness of the swelling lens, hypoechogenic layer value (the anterior layer of liquefied lenticular masses), anterior chamber depth and intralenticular pressure magnitude was defined. For the first time, the intraoperative intralenticular pressure was measured in patients with intumescent cataract. A dependency was defined between the thickness of the lens and the anterior layer of liquefied lenticular masses, anterior chamber depth, and intralenticular pressure magnitude; based on this, a mathematical model for intralenticular pressure measurement was constructed."
29953080," Prediction of the clinical course of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is one of the main directions in solving the problem of vision loss prevention and stabilization of the pathological process. Simple statistical methods of correlation analysis show the extent of each risk factor's impact, but do not indicate the total impact of these factors in personalized combinations. The relationships between the risk factors is subject to correlation and regression analysis. The regression equation represents the dependence of the mathematical expectation of the resulting sign on the combination of factor signs. To develop a technique for predicting the probability of development and progression of primary open-angle glaucoma based on a personalized combination of risk factors by linear multivariate regression analysis. The study included 66 patients (23 female and 43 male; 132 eyes) with newly diagnosed primary open-angle glaucoma. The control group consisted of 14 patients (8 male and 6 female). Standard ophthalmic examination was supplemented with biochemical study of lacrimal fluid. Concentration of matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2 and MMP-9 in tear fluid in both eyes was determined using 'sandwich' enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. The study resulted in the development of regression equations and step-by-step multivariate logistic models that can help calculate the risk of development and progression of POAG. Those models are based on expert evaluation of clinical and instrumental indicators of hydrodynamic disturbances (coefficient of outflow ease - C, volume of intraocular fluid secretion - F, fluctuation of intraocular pressure), as well as personalized morphometric parameters of the retina (central retinal thickness in the macular area) and concentration of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the tear film. The newly developed regression equations are highly informative and can be a reliable tool for studying of the influence vector and assessment of pathogenic potential of the independent risk factors in specific personalized combinations."
29953079," To assess the safety and efficacy of phaco-canaloplasty in patients with concomitant advanced pseudoexfoliation glaucoma and cataract. The study included 56 patients (57 eyes) who underwent phacoanaloplasty guided by Glaucolight microcatheter. All patients were followed up for 48 months. Visual acuity, changes of intraocular pressure (IOP), use of glaucoma medications, incidence of complications, as well as postsurgical interventions were examined. Mean preoperative IOP decreased significantly from 29.8 mmHg (15.8-61.6) with a mean of 1.92 (0-3) glaucoma drops to 12.9 mmHg (11.0-19.6) with a mean of 0.12 (0-3) drops respectively 48 months after phacocanaloplasty. Mean visual acuity increased from preoperative 0.15 (0.01-0.8) to 0.6 (0.01-1.2). The most frequent complications included intraoperative perforation of Descemet's membrane (4 eyes, 7%) and hyphema (37 eyes, 65%), IOP spikes (4 eyes, 7%) and inflammation (4 eyes, 7%) in the early postoperative period. Phacocanaloplasty in eyes with concomitant advanced pseudoexfoliation glaucoma and cataract re-establishes the natural outflow system and leads to significant IOP reduction with minimal risk of intra- and postoperative complications."
29953078," To examine the relationship between the development of bioelectric response of retinal cell elements to pattern stimulus and the ocular blood flow. Electrophysiological studies, including pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (VEP) with large 1 degree (1°) and small 0.25° checks, Color Doppler imaging (CDI) of the retrobulbar vessels, and OCT Angiography in the area of the optic disc and peripapillary retina were performed in 48 patients with initial primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), 47 patients with advanced POAG, and 42 control subjects. Authors also studied the correlations between VEP values and the parameters used in CDI and OCT-A examination. The most noticeable differences between the study groups were the amplitudes of P100 pattern VEP values for small and large patterns and the OCT-A parameters: Whole-image Disc Vessel Density (widVD), Peripapillary Vessel Density (pVD), Peripapillary Vessel Density Inferior Temporalis (pVD IT). In initial glaucoma, a strong correlation was observed between the amplitude of P100 pattern VEP 1° and pVD IT (r=0.75; p<0.0001); the blood flow rates in ophthalmic artery, central retinal artery, central retinal vein and short posterior ciliary arteries were below normal, while the blood flow in these vessels had statistically reliable correlation with the amplitude of P100 pattern VEP (p<0.05). No correlation was found in patients with advanced stages of glaucoma. Pattern VEP is an informative method of glaucoma diagnostics which accuracy can be enhanced by combining it with OCT-A blood flow examination."
29953077," Small choroidal melanoma is a malignant tumor that is prone to early metastasis, its amelanotic form is often similar to circumscribed choroidal hemangioma. The main attribute for tumor identification is its vascularization, which is the target of various examination methods. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has not been previously used in complex diagnostics of early choroidal melanoma and circumscribed choroidal hemangioma for detection of tumor vessels and the nature of their branching, as well as for vessel caliber comparison. Purpose to examine vascularization of early uveal melanoma and circumscribed choroidal hemangioma by optical coherence tomography angiography. The study included 23 patients with early choroidal melanoma (13 subjects) and circumscribed choroidal hemangioma (10 subjects) that were examined by optical coherence tomography angiography. According to ultrasound investigation, mean tumor prominence was 1.1±0.3 mm, mean base diameter - 8.1±0.6 mm. Optical coherence tomography angiography in 13 patients with small choroidal melanoma revealed presence of a neovascular component localized under retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) that had marginal avascular zone corresponding to the tumor slope. The loop-like shape of tumor vessels with numerous twists and interweaving was noted under retinal vessels. A tree-shaped neovascular component with large-caliber vessels in the form of a tree trunk with multiple branches extending from it was seen under RPE in 4 cases with circumscribed choroidal hemangioma; diffuse vascularization in the form of numerous tiny tortuous vascular branches was seen in 6 patients. Optical coherence tomography angiography allows detection of tumor`s own vessels with characteristics of their vascularization in early choroidal melanoma and circumscribed choroidal hemangioma. Increasing the frequency of detection of tumor`s own vessels will make possible early differential diagnostics of a malignant or benign tumor and will help establish adequate conserving therapy."
29953066," The present review of the literature is focused on the methods designed for the prevention of incompetent tracheorrhaphy. The main cause that dictates the necessity of strengthening the sutures is the risk of the development of the complications during the postoperative period following the surgical interventions. The incompetence of the tracheal anastomoses is known to occur in 3.6-26.3% of the patients which leads to the development of such complications as neck phlegmon, mediastinitis, and pleural empyema. The mortality rate amounts to 18.2%. The authors describe the methods employed for the prevention of incompetent tracheorrhaphy following the circular resections and suturing of the linear traumatic defects. The advantages and disadvantages of individual methods are discussed."
29953065," The primary objective of the present study was to highlight the current state of research on the pathology of the lacrimal organs based on the results of the analysis of the relevant publications in the domestic and foreign scientific literature. Special attention in this review is given to the problems of diagnostics, indications for the probing, the treatment and stenting strategies. The authors report their original observations contributing to the better understanding of the anatomical features of the nasolacrimal passages. In addition, the data on the principal pathogenic agents are presented together with certain peculiarities of the surgical treatment of the pathology under consideration."
29953064," Tympanophonia can be a consequence of a variety of diseases and pathological conditions diagnostics of which encounters difficulties. The comprehensive clinical examination of the patient is necessary to determine the cause of tympanophonia including elucidation of the following characteristics: initial (acute or gradual) sensation of sound in the ear(s), duration of persisting clinical manifestations, the presence of an acoustic or craniocerebral injury, characteristics of the noise, viz. continuous or intermittent, clicking sounds, paroxysmal or pulsed noise (synchronous with the heart beating), fluctuating, audible to the patient alone or to the surrounding people as well, unilateral and bilateral noises (either symmetric or asymmetric), perception of noise in the head rather than ears., high- and low-pitched noise together with the accompanying neurological symptoms. The analysis of these characteristics makes it possible to differentiate between objective and subjective sensation of noise in the ear(s), determine the amount of additional studies needed for the evaluatio of the conditions of a given patient, identify the possible cause of tympanophonia, establish the nosological diagnosis, and distinguish a group of the patients in need of emergency otological management."
29953063," The choice of the treatment strategy for the patients presenting with the patulous Eustachian tube syndrome constitutes a serious challenge for an otorhinolaryngologist. Despite the considerable progress achieved during the past years in the development of modern pharmacotherapy and functional endoscopic surgery, the specialists often encounter difficulties in the management of the patients suffering from this disease. The present article (continuing the previous communication) contains information concerning the historical and modern approaches to the treatment of the patients with the patulous Eustachian tube syndrome. The authors describe the conservative and surgical methods employed for the treatment of this condition and the approaches to the choice of the treatment strategies depending on the etiology, pathogenesis, and severity of the disorder being considered, its duration, and the character of the morphological changes identified during the diagnostic procedures. The authors emphasize the importance of the wait-and-see strategy for the treatment of the patients presenting with the patulous Eustachian tube syndrome. In conclusion, they present the concrete results of four original observations of such patients."
29953062," The author presents his personal observation of a complex wound on the neck treated with a favourable outcome. Prior to the surgical intervention, the efficient intubation was performed by an anesthesiologist through the wound at the frontal surface of the neck which communicated with the cavity of the oropharynx. The revision showed the injury to the superior thyroid artery branching off from the external carotid artery. Ligation of the vessel did not cause the deterioration of cervical circulation. The long-term hemostasis was achieved, Thereafter, the mid-tracheostomy was performed and the nasogastric tube installed. The wound was copiously washed with an antiseptic solution. The layer by layer suturing of the mucous membrane of the oropharynx was carried out. The hyoid bone was sutured to the soft tissues of the floor of the mouth, and the oropharynx was reconstructed. The soft tissues were juxtaposed and sutured. The rubber graduates were removed on day 3 after the termination of the surgical intervention. The tracheostomy tube and nasogastric tube were removed on the 7"
29953061," This article reports two clinical cases of the successful treatment of the gunshot wounds in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses of the children resulting from the careless use of the pneumatic weapons. Despite the fact that the shots were fired from a close distance, the intracranial structures and the eyeballs remained unaffected. The bullets were localized in the nasal septum of one child and in the frontal recess of the other as is typical of the injuries inflicted to the nose and paranasal sinuses by the shots from the air rifles. Multi-slice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) is known to have a number of important advantages over the roentgenological examination for determining the location of the bullets. Bullets for pneumatic rifles are manufactured in the form of the balls either from lead or copper-coated steel; therefore, they are a priory can not be removed with the use of a magnet."
29953060," Adenoid cystic carcinoma is one of the rare pathological conditions affecting the larynx. It is known to develop from the glandula elements present in this organ. The authors report a clinical observation of adenoid cystic carcinoma in the form of an exophytic tumour of the pale pink colour having a smooth surface and the well-pronounced vascular patterns at the base. The neoplasm is localized in the arytenoid and retroarytenoid cartilage regions. Being of 3.5-4 cm in size, the tumour causes the narrowing of the larynx in its posterior portions and restricts its mobility. Bearing in mind the considerable extension of the neoplastic process, we undertook laryngectomy including the resection of the orolaryngopharynx and the cervical portion of the oesophagus, the subtotal resection of the thyroid gland and the simultaneous reconstruction of the orolaryngopharynx."
29953059, This article was designed to report a clinical case of an acute acoustic injury inflicted by a discharge of the lightning ball during the early postoperative period in a female patient following surgical stapedoplasty. The acoustic impact resulted in a marked deterioration of hearing in the operated ear with simultaneous elevation of the threshold of bone sound conduction to above the preoperative value. It is concluded that the patients who had undergone the stapedoplastic surgical intervention should be advised to avoid strong acoustic impacts during the postoperative period.
29953058," This article describes the modern approaches to the diagnostics and treatment of fungoid conditions of the pharynx with special reference to the main methods for the detection of pharyngomycosis and its clinical manifestations based on the results of analysis of the investigations carried out during the period from 2012 till 2016. Among the 3,465 patients presenting with chronic inflammatory pathology of the pharynx who sought medical advice and treatment at the clinical departments of the Institute, 861 ones (25%) were found to have mycotic lesions of the pharynx. Erythematous (atrophic) chronic pharyngitis was the predominant form of the disease documented in 2,059 patients whereas the remaining 1, 406 ones presented with the hypertrophic forms. The fungal infection was diagnosed in 403 (19,5%) patients with erythematous atrophic chronic pharyngitis in comparison with 458 (32,5%) patients suffering from the hypertrophic forms of this pathology including pseudomembranous, hyperplastic (granulomatous), and erosive-ulcerative ones. The principal pathogenic agents responsible for the development of fungal pharyngitis in our patients were fungi of the genus Candida that accounted for 97 - 99% of all the cases of this disease. The currently available modalities for the treatment of pharyngomycosis are described."
29953057," The main objectives of the present article were to systematize the modern views of the causes and risk factors of allergic rhinitis, to clarify the manner of its development, to define the leading etiological mechanism underling the pathogenesis of this condition, to consider the methods used for the diagnostics and the treatment of this disease, and to sum up the clinical experience with the use of Levocetirizine (Allerwey) for the management of allergic rhinitis. Special attention is given to the achievement and the maintenance of control of the persistent or intermittent forms of allergic rhinitis and to approaches to its treatment based on the medications registered in the Russian Federation."
29953056," The objective of the present study was to upgrade the rhinological simulator employed as a tool for the teaching of the basic technical skills in endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). The new ESS simulator providing a model of the nasal cavity consists of the replaceable cylinders and the adaptable table stand. It includes a set of 3D printed nasal models. Each of them is the elliptical tube of a specific size. The participants of the study performed different tasks depending on the structural properties of the tubes. A wide variety of surgical instruments and esndoscopes could be fitted to the simulator. 16 otorhinolaryngologists having no previous experience with ESS were recruited into the study to evaluate the effectiveness of the training procedures. After a brief tutorial, the participants practiced an one hour-long exercise per day during 5 days. The pre-training and post-training performances were videotaped. The task-performance time and the number of technical errors made by the operators were estimated immediately before and after the training session. To assess the subjective attitudes of the operators toward the new technology, the participants of the study were asked to complete the model questionnaire soon after the termination of the training course. The questionnaire contained 34 items. The correctness of the answers was assessed based on the 5-point Likert scale, with score 1 meaning 'totally disagree' and score 5 - 'totally agree'. The statistically significant reduction of the performance time and the number of technical mistakes was documented within the first 5 hours after the onset of teaching (p<0.05) which suggests the effectiveness of the training procedures. The questionnaire study has demonstrated the positive attitude of the trainees toward the proposed technology. The average score based on the Likert scale was higher than 3 for all kinds of questions. It is concluded that the results of this study give evidence of the positive assessment of the upgraded rhinological simulator as an effective tool for the teaching of the basic skills necessary to operate various surgical instruments and endoscopes by the novice surgeons in the field of endoscopic sinus surgery ."
29953055," The objective of the present study was the comparison of the effectiveness of the application of tonsilgon-N in the combination with the physical methods for sanitization of the palatine tonsil lagunes with that of the standard conservative treatment. A total of 60 patients having the confirmed diagnosis of sub-compensated form of chronic tonsillitis were recruited to participate in the study. All the patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 was comprised of 30 patients to whom tonsilgon-N was prescribed for the oral administration (25 droplets thrice daily for 30 days) in the combination with lagune cleansing with the use of the Tonsillor apparatus during 30 days (a total of 10 procedures). Group 2 consisted of 30 patients to whom only 10 sessions of rinsing the palatine tonsil lagunes were prescribed. The inoculums taken from the tonsils of the patients of group 1 contained no Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Moraxella catarhalis on the 15th day after the initiation of the treatment whereas the presence of the persisting pathogenic bacterial species was documented in 23.3% of the patients of this group. 10% of the patients in group 2 were found to retain Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Moraxella catarhalis in their tonsils whereas the rate of isolation of the pathogenic biotope amounted to 36,6%."
29953054, This article was designed to report the results of analysis of the dynamics of oedema of the soft tissues of the external nose and the adjacent facial structures in different periods following rhinoplasty. The metric characteristics were calculated and the integral index of tissue oedema was determined for 374 patients allocated to two groups. The main group was comprised of 286 (86.5%) patients who underwent the postoperative rehabilitative treatment making use of the proposed method. The remaining 88 (23.5%) patients constituted the group of comparison. The analysis of the data obtained has demonstrated that the compliance with the newly developed algorithm for the postoperative rehabilitation permits to considerably reduce the severity of the inflammatory reaction of the organism to the post-surgical trauma and to shorten the duration of the postoperative rehabilitation.
29953053," The objective of the present study was to elaborate the therapeutic algorithm for the treatment of laryngomycosis. We have examined a total of 430 patients suffering from chronic laryngitis including 100 ones (23.2%) having the fungal flora. Mycosis was diagnosed by the microscopic study of the stained preparations with the application of various techniques; moreover, cultivation in elective nutrient media was used. The yeast-like fungi of the genus Candida were identified in 98 (98%) and mold fungi of the genus Aspergillus in the remaining 2 (2%) patients. All these 100 patients were given the antifungal treatment. 98 of them presenting with candidal laryngitis were allocated to three groups. Group A was comprised of 33 patients who received the local treatment alone, group B contained 31 patients given only systemic therapy, and group C included 34 patients undergoing the combined treatment with the use of the medications possessed of both the local and systemic actions. The best clinical results were obtained in the patients of the latter group in which the therapeutic efficiency proved to be as high as 79.4%. It is concluded that all the patients suffering from laryngomycosis are in need of the combined treatment designed to eradicate the causative agent, restore the vocal function, and achieve the stable remission of the chronic inflammatory process in the larynx. The combined treatment with the antimycotic medications exhibiting both the general systemic and local activities during 3 weeks appears to be the optimal therapeutic modality for the management of laryngomycosis. Of special importance is the dynamic follow-up of the treated patients including the control examinations in the course of the treatment (days 7, 14, and 21) to be followed by the mycological study after the termination of therapy and its repetition every 3 months during the subsequent period."
29953052, The article describes the domestic modern diagnostic and expert approaches to the quantitative assessment of the hearing impairment in the subjects employed under conditions of enhanced occupational noise. It is concluded that the quantitative criteria for the determination of the severity of hearing loss in the workers of the 'noisy' professions adopted in this country are comparable with the respective international standards of and approaches to the medico-social examination practiced worldwide.
29953051," The objective of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of mono- and binaural hearing aids in the rehabilitation of the adult patients of different age presenting with chronic symmetric hearing loss (CSHL). A total of 263 subjects at the age from 50 to 88 years complaining of moderate to severe (grade I-IV) chronic symmetric hearing impairment were available for the examination. Following the ENT examination with the application of pure tone audiometry and impedancometry, the participants of the study were supplied with the individually fitted digital behind-the-ear hearing instruments and underwent speech audiometry in the free sound field. The intelligibility of polysyllabic words in the calm and noisy environment was evaluated. A significant deterioration of the intelligibility was documented both under the quiet and noisy conditions. Its severity increased with the patients' age and the degree of hearing impairment. The comparison of the results of speech audiometry in the patients using either a single or two hearing aids gave evidence that binaural hearing aids were more efficient than monoaural ones in 86% of the patients. Re-examination of the same patients one year after the completion of the first study has demonstrated that 59% of them became permanent users of the hearing aids with 47% of them making regular use of simultaneously two hearing aids. It is concluded that speech audiometry in the free sound field can be recommended as a highly informative method that allows to substantiate the reasonable choice between the mono- and binaural hearing aids for the adult patients presenting with hearing impairment."
29953050," The objective of the present study was to characterize the effectiveness of the audiological and radiological diagnostic techniques as well as the results of the surgical treatment of the patients presenting with otosclerosis based at the hospital clinic of the Pacific State Medical University. The analysis included 49 surgical interventions for stapedoplasty carried out on 42 patients during the period from 2015 to 2017. The tympanic form of the disorder was diagnosed in 51.02% of the cases, the mixed form I in 16.28%, and the mixed form II in 32.7%. The excellent results within two months after surgery were obtained in 87.2% of the treated patients, the good and satisfactory results in 8.72% and 4.08% of them respectively."
29953049," The relevance of the problem of a sensorineural hearing loss (ASNL) arises from the necessity of the special approaches to the diagnostics of this condition, the complications accompanying this pathology, and the difficulties encountered in the implementation of the methods designed for hearing rehabilitation of such patients. The objective of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of ASHL among the adult population. The sensorineural impairment of hearing was diagnosed in a total of 2456 (72%) examined patients presenting with hearing loss. To determine the presence of asymmetry of sensorineural hearing loss, we employed three counting techniques allowing (1) to calculate the difference between the average hearing thresholds at four frequencies within the range from 0.5 to 4 kHz (the difference was found to be 15 dB or more in 17% of the patients), (2) to calculate the difference between the degrees of hearing loss in the right and left ears (the difference was documented in 47% of the patients), (3) to calculate the difference between the hearing thresholds at least at a single frequency within the range from 0.125 to 8 kHz (he difference was found to be 15 dB or more in 71% of the patients). When using the third method to characterize asymmetry of hearing impairment, it was identified in most patients (53%) at one or two frequencies. Moreover, there was a large number of the patients (13%) with asymmetry apparent over the entire frequency range. A high degree of threshold asymmetry (in excess of 40 dB) was more often noted in the mid-frequency range. In the majority of the patients, the asymmetry manifested itself as the different degree of bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment (51%) or unilateral sensorineural hearing loss with the normal hearing ability preserved in the contralateral ear (35%). The results of the present study give evidence of the necessity of developing a reliable method for the identification of clinically significant ACNL."
29953048," The present study was designed to elucidate the possibilities for the application of angled endoscopes in the sanation of those compartments of the middle ear which are difficult to access for visual control with the use of a microscope, such as the retrotympanic structures (e.g. tympanic and facial retraction pockets), anterior epitympanum, etc. To this effect, we have undertaken the analysis of the results of surgical interventions on the children presenting with chronic suppurative otitis media and concomitant cholesteatoma. A total of 59 primary operations and 35 secondary ones were performed to treat recurrent cholesteatoma. In 41 cases, the surgical intervention was carried out without the endoscopic assistance whereas in the remaining 53 ones the microscopic observation of the difficult-to-access compartments of the middle ear were supplemented by the application of an angled endoscope. Whenever residual portions of cholesteatoma were identified, they were removed under the endoscopic control. The algorithm for the endoscopic assistance during such operations has been proposed, its advantages and limitations are considered. It is concluded that the combination of microscopic and endoscopic techniques for the examination of and operation on the middle ear creates the conditions for the more reliable (in comparison with the traditional otomicroscopic methods) removal of the residual cholesteatoma tissues and thereby allows to reduces the risk of development of residual cholesteatoma from 25% to 13.5%. The results of the present study have demonstrated the necessity of development of a universal approach to the identification of the clinically significant manifestations of chronic suppurative otitis media and cholesteatoma."
29953047," We have undertaken the analysis of the specific clinical manifestations of acquired cholesteatoma of the middle ear in 437 chronic patients suffering from this pathology. 96.1% of them presented with primarily acquired cholesteatoma of the middle ear (including 53.3% having attic cholesteatoma, 22.8% with sinus cholesteatoma, and 19.9% of tensa retraction cholesteatoma). 3.9% of the patients exhibited a different mechanism of development of cholesteatoma. The secondary acquired mesotympanic cholesteatoma formed in association with the long-term chronic inflammation of the middle ear, concomitant perforation of the tympanic membrane and epithelial invasion from the edge of the tympanic membrane perforation and middle ear cavity. Typmanosclerosis of different degree and localization played an important role in the enhancement of the prevalence of this condition. All types of acquired cholesteatoma were found to extend beyond the point of origin of the disorder. The maximum destruction of the ossicular chain was documented in the patients presenting with sinus cholesteatoma. Those with secondary acquired cholesteatoma showed the worst functional capacity as a result of rigid fixation of the auditory ossicles. The overall cholesteatoma relapse rate (including both residual and recurrent cholesteatoma) was estimated to be 15.6%. It is concluded that the surgical strategy should be chosen on an individual basis for each concrete patient. The long-term observation of the treated patients with the application of the up-to-date radiological techniques is believed to be the indispensable prerequisite for the successful management of the complicated pathology under consideration."
29953046," This article is focused on the peculiar features of diagnostics and treatment of dizziness and vertigo in the patients presenting with vestibular neuronitis. The authors present the detailed overview of various theories concerning etiology and pathogenesis of this condition, describe the methods for its clinical and instrumental diagnostics (including its differential diagnostics from other diseases associated with acute dizziness and vertigo). Special attention is given to the methods of pharmacological and physical rehabilitation of the patients suffering from vestibular neuronitis."
23867059," Healthcare providers do not uniformly screen young patients for exposure to bullying, and no screening instruments have been developed for widespread use in clinical settings. The objectives of this study were to (a) generate scale items by identifying and eliciting concepts relevant to youths with potential exposure to bullying as well as to professionals who work with bullied youths and (b) assess the content validity of the new Child-Adolescent Bullying Scale (CABS) instrument. A mixed-methods design was used to develop an initial pool of 52 items. The study was conducted in four phases: (I) comprehensive review of the existing literature; (II) concept elicitation through the conduct of focus groups with school-age youths and professionals who work with bullied youths; (III) concept selection and item construction; and (IV) content validation assessment of relevance, clarity, and dimension of each item by a panel of 30 international bullying and measurement experts through completion of an online survey. An initial pool of 52 potential items was developed during Phases I-III of the study. During Phase IV, item- and scale-level content validity indices were calculated and were used to refine the item pool. These strategies resulted in a new, 22-item tool, with scale-level content validity indices of .954 for clarity and .920 for representativeness. Evaluation of the CABS tool with a sample of youths drawn from healthcare settings will be necessary to assess the performance of the CABS items, further evaluate its psychometric properties, and further refine the tool."
29953043," Early prediction of future functional capability is crucial for stroke survivors' care management. The purposes of this study were to test the trajectory of change across time in activities of daily living (ADLs) and to determine whether the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score within 24 hours poststroke, gender, and age predict ADLs at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months poststroke. A prospective cohort design was used. Baseline characteristics and neurological deficits were measured in 1,021 stroke survivors. The 13-item NIHSS was used to examine neurological status within 24 hours poststroke. ADLs were measured with the Barthel index at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months poststroke. A latent growth curve model was used to analyze how the dynamic changes in ADLs were related to NIHSS score, gender, and age. The latent growth curve model analyses revealed that, as the time following a stroke increases, survivors tend to gradually improve with regard to ADLs. In addition, lower levels of initial ADLs were associated with higher growth in ADLs over time. However, after 6 months poststroke, further gains in ADLs slowed. Based on further analysis, the findings indicate that a lower NIHSS score, being male, and a young age at time of stroke were associated with higher initial levels of ADLs. Having a higher NIHSS score, being female, and a young age at time of stroke predicted an increase in ADLs over time. To promote ADLs of stroke patients, NIHSS score at admission, gender, and age should be included as important predictors of stroke care management. The results highlight that the rehabilitation of stroke patients should be focused more on ADLs at 1-6 months poststroke."
29953040," Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting the basal nuclei, causing motor and cognitive disorders. Bearing in mind that standard treatments are ineffective in delaying the disease progression, alternative treatments capable of eliminating symptoms and reversing the clinical condition have been sought. Possible alternative treatments include cell therapy, especially with the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). MSC are adult stem cells which have demonstrated remarkable therapeutic power in parkinsonian animals due to their differentiation competence, migratory capacity and the production of bioactive molecules. This review aims to analyze the main studies involving MSC and PD in more than a decade of studies, addressing their different methodologies and common characteristics, as well as suggesting perspectives on the application of MSC in PD. The results of MSC therapy in animal models and some clinical trials suggest that such cellular therapy may slow the progression of PD and promote neuroregeneration. However, further research is needed to address the limitations of an eventual clinical application."
29953039, Diagnostic error is an increasing health care concern. An intravenous drug abuser with chronic meningitis died after a prolonged hospitalization from fungal meningitis diagnosed at autopsy. We examine the diagnostic pitfalls and consider how a computer-assisted diagnostic system may influence the outcome of an otherwise fatal condition.
29953038," Acute cerebral injuries, such as cerebral ischemic or hemorrhagic events, have been repeatedly correlated with sudden electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as cardiac arrhythmias, QT prolongation, and T-wave inversion (the ""cerebral T-wave""). Injuries to the insular cortex have been reported in the literature to result in such changes, possibly due to increased sympathetic tone to the cardiac system. A 65-year-old gentleman presented with an acute right middle cerebral artery territory infarction, and was found to have ECG abnormalities and left ventricular dysfunction, which improved after the acute phase of the stroke. Acute ischemic infarcts, particularly to the right insular cortex, can result in ECG abnormalities, such as QT prolongation and T-wave inversion, as well as acute systolic heart failure; all of which may be reversible after the acute phase of the stroke."
29953037," Brucellosis, an endemic zoonosis in Portugal, is a multisystem disease, presenting with neurological manifestations in up to 25% of cases. Neurobrucellosis diagnostic criteria include evidence of central nervous system invasion, either by documenting increased blood-brain barrier permeability that normalizes after treatment or by Brucella isolation. We report 2 patients with systemic brucellosis presenting with neurological symptoms: A 28-year-old female with progressive hemiparesis associated with severe refractory thoracic and lumbar pain, whose spinal magnetic resonance imaging identified longitudinally extensive myelitis. Brucella agglutination test was positive in blood; however, cerebrospinal fluid cytochemical, serological testing, and cultures were negative. A 58-year-old male with intermittent fever in the evening, associated with severe refractory cervical and lumbar spinal and radicular pain. Blood workup identified leukocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers and positive Brucella agglutination test. Cerebrospinal fluid presented mild protein increase and negative serological testing and cultures. Electromyogram revealed demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. In both cases, antibiotic therapy induced symptom resolution. Despite the neurological presentation, no evidence of direct nervous system infection was found. An indirect mechanism appears to be involved, such as a parainfectious syndrome or circulating endotoxins release by the bacteria. Brucellosis should be considered in patients presenting with inflammatory neurological symptoms in endemic regions. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important as chronic infection has significant morbidity."
29953036," Patients with overlapping Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), and the Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BBE) have rarely been reported, and the diverse clinical features and sequelae are challenging for physicians. Through this case report, we present the clinical course, treatment, recovery, and sequelae of an overlapping MFS, GBS, and BBE syndrome and provide a review of the literature. A 76-year-old woman was initially presented with diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia, but she later developed weakness of limbs, respiratory failure, deterioration of consciousness, and cognitive impairment. After IV immunoglobulin and corticosteroid therapy, she began to recover consciousness and from the weakness from day 18. After 8 months of rehabilitative therapy, she was able to swallow food without difficulty, but she still cannot walk without assistance, showed cognitive impairment, and the tracheostomy remained in place because of persistent respiratory muscle weakness. As the clinical course of MFS-GBS-BBE overlapping syndrome is variable, involving not only the peripheral but also the central nervous system, the establishment of a comprehensive therapeutic strategy is warranted."
29953035," Descriptions of the natural history of cerebrovascular complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) characterize ischemic stroke as common during childhood and hemorrhagic stroke as more common in adulthood. Childhood ischemic stroke is attributed to vasculopathy with moyamoya syndrome. Hemorrhagic stroke is commonly attributed to aneurysms accompanying HbSS cerebral vasculopathy in SCD. However, a growing body of literature highlights multiple contributing factors to hemorrhagic stroke in children. Primary hemorrhagic stroke is one of the most devastating neurological complications of SCD. We describe the case of an 18-year-old female affected by HbSS genotype SCD presenting with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) as well as features of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) after transfusion of red blood cells. We reviewed the existing literature dealing with SCD, blood transfusion, and hemorrhagic strokes. To our knowledge, this case presentation is unique with convexity SAH predominantly attributable to a RCVS spectrum disorder occurring in the setting of a recent blood transfusion in an adolescent female with SCD. As this case illustrates, neurological deterioration accompanied by intracranial hemorrhage in children and young adults with SCD after blood transfusion should raise suspicion for RCVS as part of a complex cerebral vasculopathy. A better understanding of the risk factors leading to hemorrhagic stroke may help prevent this severe complication in subjects with SCD. Neuroimaging including angiography in these subjects may enable prompt diagnosis and management."
29953034," Patients who present emergently with acute neurological signs and symptoms represent unique diagnostic challenges for clinicians. We sought to characterize the reliability of physician diagnosis in differentiating aborted or imaging-negative acute ischemic stroke from stroke mimic. We constructed 10 case-vignettes of patients treated with thrombolysis with subsequent clinical improvement who lacked radiographic evidence of infarction. Using an online survey, we asked physicians to select a most likely final diagnosis after reading each case-vignette. Inter-rater agreement was evaluated using percent agreement and κ statistic for multiple raters with 95% confidence intervals reported. Sixty-five physicians participated in the survey. Most participants were in practice for ≥5 years and over half were vascular neurologists. Physicians agreed on the most likely final diagnosis 71% of the time, κ of 0.21 (95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.54). Percent agreement was similar across participant practice locations, years of experience, subspecialty training, and personal experience with thrombolysis. We found modest agreement among surveyed physicians in distinguishing ischemic stroke syndromes from stroke mimics in patients without radiographic evidence of infarction and clinical improvement after thrombolysis. Methods to improve diagnostic consensus after thrombolysis are needed to assure acute ischemic stroke patients and stroke mimics are treated safely and accurately."
29953033," Epicardial adipose tissue is metabolically active and is an important predictor of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. This study investigated the echocardiographic epicardial adipose tissue measurement in young patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). We studied 77 volunteers, including 40 patients with ESUS (mean age 43±8 y, 16 female patients) and 37 healthy subjects (mean age 38±7 y, 20 female subjects). All necessary biochemical parameters were analyzed, and epicardial fat thickness (EFT) was measured by echocardiography in all subjects. Additional related diagnostic work-up was conducted in each patient, according to the patients' clinical presentation. The patients with ESUS had a significantly higher EFT than the control group (5.51±0.82 vs. 3.96±0.51; P<0.01). Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between EFT and serum C-reactive protein levels (r=0.284; P<0.05). As an optimal cut-off point, a high-risk EFT value of 4.6 mm was determined to predict ESUS, with an 87.5% sensitivity and an 81.1% specificity. We found that echocardiographic EFT was significantly higher in young patients with ESUS than in healthy individuals. Increased EFT might be a novel risk factor in these patients."
29953032," The intense liver uptake of technetium-99-sestamibi (Tc-MIBI) and photon scattering from the liver cause problems in quantitative perfusion interpretation. Hence, Tc-MIBI is a substrate for P-glycoprotein pump; variations in P-glycoprotein levels may affect liver clearance. Adult female Wistar rats were divided into seven main groups [control and St. John's Wort (SJW) treated] and each SJW-treated group included three subgroups that were killed at 15, 30, and 45 min after Tc-MIBI injection. Treated groups received an SJW extract suspension at two doses of 100 and 400 mg/kg once daily for 5, 10, and 14 days, respectively. Tc-MIBI was injected intravenously to all rats 24 h after the final treatment. The rats were anesthetized at the mentioned time after tracer injection, and heart and liver tissues were removed, weighed, and their radioactivity was counted. One rat from each group was selected randomly for myocardial perfusion imaging. A significant increase in liver clearance and heart-to-liver ratio was observed in all SJW-treated groups compared with the control, especially at 10 days after SJW treatment. The heart radioactivity decreased in SJW-receiving groups at 14 days after SJW treatment. This study showed that SJW extract accelerates the liver clearance of Tc-MIBI and significantly reduces photon scattering from the liver."
29953031," The early use of tranexamic acid (TXA) is strongly advocated in patients who are likely to require massive transfusion to decrease mortality. This study determines the influence of hemorrhage on the pharmacokinetics of TXA in a porcine model. The investigation was a prospective experimental study in Yucatan minipigs. First, in vitro plasma-cell partitioning of TXA was evaluated by inoculating whole blood with known aliquots, centrifuging, and measuring the supernatant with high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Then, using in vivo modeling, normovolemic and hypovolemic (35% reduction in blood volume) swine (n = 4 per group) received 1 g of intravenous TXA and had blood sampled at 14 time points over 4 hours to determine baseline clearance via HPLC-MS. Additional swine (n = 4) were hemorrhaged 35% of their blood volume, and TXA was administered as a 15 mg/kg infusion over 10 minutes followed by infusion of 1.875 mg/kg per hour to simulate massive hemorrhage scenario. During the first hour of TXA administration, one total blood volume was hemorrhaged and simultaneously replaced with TXA free blood. Serial blood samples and the hemorrhaged blood were analyzed by HPLC-MS to determine the percentage of dose lost via hemorrhage. Clearance of TXA was diminished in the hypovolemic group compared with the normovolemic group (115 ± 4 vs 70 ± 7 mL/min). Percentage of dose lost via hemorrhage averaged 25%. The lowest measured plasma level during the exchange transfusion was 34 μg/mL. Mean 25% of the present 2017 Joint Trauma System Clinical Practice Guideline dosing of TXA can be lost to hemorrhage if a blood volume is transfused within an hour of initiating therapy. In the case of TXA, which has limited distribution and is administered during active hemorrhage and massive blood transfusions, replacement strategies should be developed and tested to find simple methods of adjusting the current dosing guidelines to maintain therapeutic plasma concentrations. Therapeutic, level II."
29953030," This issue of the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery features topics from the 2017 Military Health System Research Symposium and starts a second decade of partnership between the Combat Casualty Care Research Program (CCCRP) and the journal. This publication comes at a time of significant change for the CCCRP, as it responds to military planning for the future multidomain battlefield (MDB). The projected MDB portends markedly different operational scenarios than those conducted over the past 17 years. Emerging threats around the globe have the Department of Defense preparing for more complex battlefields that are larger in size and scope and which pit the United States against better equipped and more sophisticated adversaries. As the CCCRP navigates this new reckoning associated with trauma care on the MDB, its research investments will need to be robust and enabled to plan, program, and budget for agile and closer-term solutions. To accomplish this, the program will need to expand on its strong foundation of lessons learned and assets developed over the past 20 years."
29953028," Identification of deteriorating severe hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) children for referral to intensive care remains problematic.The medical records of 2382 hospitalized children with severe HFMD from May 2013 to September 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. A Pediatric Early Warning System (PEWS) score was designed based on study parameters on admission, evaluated in a logistic regression model, and subsequently validated with different cut-off scores, to predict the risk for clinical deterioration.After admission, 191 cases were transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and 2191 were admitted to the infectious disease department. Of which, 116 cases were subsequently transferred to PICU, with younger age, consciousness levels of sluggishness, lethargy or drowsiness, rashes with vesicles on the hands or feet, moderate or high fever, increased or disordered lung marking or pulmonary infiltration, abnormal heart rate, fasting plasma glucose, blood platelet, and C-reactive protein. A corresponding 10-component PEWS score >7 was significantly associated with subsequent transfer to PICU.A 10-component PEWS score >7 has good specificity but poor sensitivity for identifying severe HFMD children vulnerable to clinical deterioration."
29953027," Hepaticojejunostomy, which is the ""gold standard"" procedure for repairing postoperative biliary strictures, predisposes patients to reflux cholangitis from loss of sphincter of Oddi. The aim of this study was to assess the sphincter-preserving biliary reconstruction approach to repair postoperative biliary stricture. An autologous vascularized stomach flap was prepared and used to repair biliary defect caused by postoperative biliary stricture. Patient clinical data were analyzed retrospectively and long-term prognosis was evaluated based on the Lillemoe standard. Twenty-eight patients who underwent surgery from 2002 to 2010 were enrolled for the study. The original surgical procedure that caused biliary stricture consisted of patients having cholecystectomy (n = 22), biliary duct exploration (n = 5), and hepatectomy (n = 1). Eighteen (64%) of the 28 patients had previous repair surgery before being admitted. Based on the Bismuth level, 7 were classified as type I, 15 as type II, and 6 as type III. The mean length of biliary defect determined preoperatively by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography was 1.5 cm. The surgical procedure was successfully performed for all patients with a mean operation time of 261 ± 47.8 minutes. The postoperative complication rate was 10.7%, including minor bile leak (n = 2) and pulmonary infection (n = 1). There was no perioperative deaths. Two patients were absent during follow-up, and the remaining 26 patients had a mean follow-up period of 7.5 years (61-155 months). Twenty-four patients remained healthy during the follow-up period, while 2 patients (7.7%) had sporadic recurrent cholangitis that eventually resolved spontaneously. The overall long-term outcome rate was 92.3%. None of the patients had recurrence of stricture during the follow-up period. These results suggest that biliary repair using vascularized stomach flap could reduce reflux cholangitis and offer a satisfactory long-term outcome. This procedure could be a reliable method to repair postoperative biliary stricture with limited biliary defect."
29953026," Orofacial pain encompasses painful conditions, such as temporomandibular disorder (TMD). Multidisciplinary health teams seek to control such musculoskeletal disorders to improve the quality and functional capacity of the muscles of mastication. The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the effect of low-level laser therapy as a form of treatment for the prevention of initial fatigue of the muscles of mastication (masseter and anterior temporal muscles) as well as the recovery of these muscles after induced exhaustion (caused by isometric contraction) in young adults. The participants will be 78 healthy male and female volunteers between 18 and 34 years of age. The volunteers will be randomly allocated to a laser group (n = 26), sham group (n = 26), and control group (n = 26). All participants will be submitted to a clinical evaluation to record mandibular movements, bite force, muscle sensitivity to palpation, and initial muscle fatigue. Initial fatigue will be induced by isometric contraction of the jaws. Maximum voluntary contraction will be performed to record the time until initial exhaustion of the masseter muscle (determined by electromyography). The groups will then be submitted to the interventions: active laser therapy (wavelength: 780 nm; fluence: 134 J/cm; power: 50 mW; irradiance: 1.675 W/cm; exposure time: 80 seconds per point) on 3 points of the masseter and 1 point on the anterior temporal muscles on each side; sham laser (placebo effect); or no intervention (control). Maximum voluntary contraction will be performed again after the interventions to record the time until initial exhaustion of the masseter muscle (determined by electromyography). Differences in individual time until exhaustion between the pre- and postintervention evaluations will be measured to determine the effect of low-level laser therapy. Although studies have been made with the use of low-level laser therapy in TMDs and on the effect of photobiomodulation on fatigue, this the first study to test this therapy in the prevention of fatigue in this region. The clinical relevance lies in the fact that longer dental procedures could take place if the patients are less prone to fatigue."
29953025," Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, has been used to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI). However, studies have found divergent effects of intraoperative mannitol administration on postoperative AKI. We therefore evaluated the effects of intraoperative mannitol administration on AKI after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) in prostate cancer patients.A total of 864 patients who underwent RALP were divided into mannitol (administered at 0.5 g/kg) and no-mannitol groups. Demographics, cancer-related data, preoperative laboratory values, intraoperative data, and postoperative outcomes such as AKI, chronic kidney disease at 12 months postoperation, duration of hospital stay, and intensive care unit admission rate and duration of stay were compared between the 2 groups using propensity score matching analysis. To determine the risk factors for AKI after RALP, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Postoperative AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria.After performing 1:1 propensity score matching, the mannitol and no-mannitol groups included 234 patients each. The overall incidence of AKI after RALP was 5.1% and was not significantly different between the no-mannitol and mannitol groups in the propensity score-matched patients (13 [5.6%] vs. 11 [4.7%], P = .832). Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that body mass index and operative time were associated with AKI in 864 patients who underwent RALP. However, intraoperative mannitol administration was not associated with AKI after RALP (P = .284). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that operative time was significantly associated with AKI after RALP (odds ratio = 1.013, P = .001). The incidence of chronic kidney disease (13 [5.6%] vs. 12 [5.1%], P = 1.000) and other postoperative outcomes were not also significantly different between the no-mannitol and mannitol groups in the propensity score-matched patients.Intraoperative mannitol administration has no beneficial effect on the prevention of AKI after RALP in prostate cancer patients. This result provides useful information for clinical practice guidelines regarding intraoperative mannitol use."
29953024," Multiple primary neoplasms (MPNs) are rare. Most MPNs are double, and triple primary neoplasms are extremely rarer. Here, we describe a case of a 66-year-old man diagnosed with metachronous triple primary neoplasms with primary prostate cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer. The patient complained of dysuria in January 2015, and he underwent transurethral resection of the prostate. The pathological results showed acinar adenocarcinoma of prostate with a Gleason score of 3+3. In January 2017, he complained of lower abdominal pain, then he took an enteroscopy examination, found a mass in the sigmoid colon, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography examination showed masses in the sigmoid colon and right upper lobe of the lung. Biopsy of the colon showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog exon 2 mutation, and biopsy of the lung showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with epidermal rowth factor receptor exon 21 mutation. Metachronous triple primary neoplasms with primary prostate cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer. The patient underwent surgical resection of the right upper lobe of the lung, postoperative stage was T1bN0M0 (stage IA). After 8 cycles of chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX6 regimen (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m, leucovorin 400 mg/m, 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m on day 1, followed by 5-fluorouracil 2400 mg/m intravenous infusion over 46 hours every 2 weeks), the patient underwent radical resection of colon cancer, and he finished the remaining 4 cycles of modified FOLFOX6 regimen chemotherapy in November 2017. The patient takes examination every three months, and the results show no recurrence. When considering MPNs, thorough surveillance by new screening methods is required to detect a second or even third neoplasm at an early stage."
29953023," Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a chronic granulomatous inflammation affecting the aorta and its main branches. The clinical symptoms are mainly due to arterial claudication and end-organ ischaemia. Abdominal pain is an uncommon manifestation of TA. We present a rare case of TA in a 13-year-old boy who first presented with abdominal pain. An emergency aortic stent implantation and aneurysm embolization were performed, and the intra-operative diagnosis was aortic pseudoaneurysm. A consultation with the department of rheumatism determined that the diagnosis was Takayasu arteritis according to the medical history, physical examination and auxiliary examination results. The patient was transferred to the department of rheumatism for treatment with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide. Six months after the initial presentation, he was doing well clinically with no additional vascular involvement, and his blood pressure had been stabilized with oral antihypertensive drugs. More detailed examinations of children with acute abdominal pain should be performed. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) should be administered, peripheral impulses and arterial bruits should be checked, and blood pressure among the four limbs should be monitored to rule out plausible emergencies such as an aneurysm caused by TA."
29953022," Clinically mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion of the corpus callosum (MERS) is a recently identified clinically and radiologically distinct syndrome. Clinical symptoms and lesions on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often disappear in 1 week or a few weeks. However, MERS manifesting as a severe clinical course with significant sequela has not yet been reported. A 42-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of headache, fever, and irrational speech. Physical examination showed a body temperature of 39.5°C, dysarthria, dyscalculia, recent memory disturbance, and otherwise normal vital signs. The patient developed status epilepticus and progressive consciousness disturbance. MRI showed abnormal patchy signals in the splenium of the corpus callosum. The clinical feature and the characteristic of MRI are mostly consistent with MERS. At the same time, we made a differential diagnosis by testing the NMDARAb, AMPA1Ab, AMPA2Ab, LG1Ab, CASPR2Ab, GABABRAb in CSF and serum. The subject was treated with ganciclovir, antiepileptic, and antipyretic therapy. The subject was living a virtually normal life with persistent mild memory disturbance. MRI showed that the abnormal signals in the splenium of the corpus callosum had disappeared, but hyperintensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR imaging was noted in the centrum semiovale. MERS is a rare clinicoradiological syndrome, which can manifest as severe symptoms as well. Early diagnosis and treatment should be emphasized, and the diagnostic value of MRI is highlighted. Clinicians should be alert to the potential sequela."
29953021," Nonadherence is common in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and leads to treatment failure and poor outcomes. Side effects due to treatment are also common in patients with CML. However, no study has investigated the link between side effects and medication adherence for patients with CML in Taiwan. Therefore, the aim of our study was to explore the influence of side effects on medication adherence in Taiwanese patients with CML.CML in chronic-phase patients treated with breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors were recruited. We designed a questionnaire to collect baseline patient information, medication adherence (measured using the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale), and side effects. Clinical outcomes were assessed by the 3-month early molecular response rate and the 12-month major molecular response rate. Statistical comparisons of different parameters between adherent and nonadherent groups were conducted.Fifty-eight patients were enrolled in this study, and 31% of them had poor adherence. The lack of information about treatment and medication was the major reason for poor medication adherence. Patients who were younger and unmarried were prone to poor adherence. The occurrence of side effects carried no statistically significant influence on adherence. Poor adherence resulted in a poor treatment response (lower 3-month early molecular response rate and lower 12-month major molecular response rate).Poor adherence is common in Taiwanese patients with CML. The main reason for a decrease in the adherence rate is the lack of comprehensive information about treatment and medication, particularly in young and single population. The next urgent step is to educate patients about their treatment and management of side effects to improve adherence and treatment outcome for patients with CML in Taiwan."
29953020," The aim of the study was to review the distribution, current trends, and microbiological characteristics of bacterial pathogens isolated from dacryocystitis patients in China during the last 15 years.This is a retrospective multiple-center noncomparative case series. The medical records of 15,452 consecutive patients from 7 cities diagnosed as having dacryocystitis between 2002 and 2016 were reviewed. The patients' demographics, microbiological data, and antibiotic sensitivity were reviewed and analyzed.A total of 3344 lacrimal sac content cultures were taken (21.6%) during the study period. A pathogen was identified in 1996 samples (59.7%), with bacterial isolates accounting for 1902 of the positive cultures (95.3%). Gram-positive isolates, gram-negative isolates, and anaerobic bacteria were found in 1218 (61.0%), 607 (30.4%), and 285 (14.3%) samples, respectively. An increase in gram-positive isolates over the study duration was found (P = .003). The predominant isolates were coagulase negative Staphylococci (485, 25.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (186, 9.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (184, 9.7%), and Haemophilus influenzae (152, 9.0%). There was a trend toward increasing resistance to erythromycin from 10.5% during the first 5 years of the study to 20.7% during the last 5 years (P < .001). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that gatifloxacin was the most effective drug against most of gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria.The microbial culture rate of dacryocystitis in China is low. There was an increase in the percentage of gram-positive bacteria over time. The sensitivity of gram-positive isolates to tested antibiotics is relatively low compared with that of gram-negative isolates. Our data show that the empiric use of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones in refractory dacryocystitis may be justified."
29953019," Late referral in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with irregular care and poor prognosis. How the specialty of healthcare provider affect late referral and irregular CKD care remain unclear.We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study to include incident dialysis patients from 2002 to 2007 in Taiwan and observed for 1, 2, and 3 years before dialysis. The medical visits-related information was evaluated every 3 months, retrospectively. Irregular follow-up was defined as missing a follow-up during more than one interval every year.A total of 46,626 patients were included. At 1, 2, and 3 years prior to maintenance dialysis, 87%, 66%, and 50% of patients had regular medical visits; however, only 49%, 23%, and 12% had estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) regularly monitored, respectively. Independent factors of less regular eGFR follow-up included age (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.995, 95% confidence interval 0.993-0.998), cardiac disorder (0.90, 0.82-0.99), and stroke (0.76, 0.69-0.84), as well as regular visits at some other specialties (adjusted OR range: from 0.77 to 0.88); whereas, independent factors of less regular visits at nephrology included diabetes mellitus (0.48, 0.46-0.51), cardiac disorder (0.61, 0.56-0.66), stroke (0.53, 0.48-0.58), and regular visits at any other specialty (adjusted OR range: from 0.22 to 0.78).Regular medical visits were quite common in late CKD patients, but they received regular eGFR measurement and visit at nephrology much less frequently. Physicians play a major role in the late referrals in CKD and its irregular care."
29953018," The incidence of molar pregnancy in the cesarean scar is exceedingly low, however, the disease may carry a high risk of uncontrolled hemorrhage or uterine rupture. So far managements of this disease were rarely reported in literature. We reported a 28-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a complaint of amenorrhea for 48 days and vaginal bleeding for 3 days. Transvaginal ultrasonography, serum hCG and pelvic MRI confirmed the cesarean scar pregnancy. The patient underwent bilateral uterine arterial embolization and suction evacuation. The postoperative histologic examination of the tissue revealed a partial hydatidiform mole. Molar pregnancy in the cesarean scar is tough to differentiate from normal cesarean scar pregnancy with serum hCG, sonogram or MRI. This case suggested us that it was necessary to perform a histological examination of postoperative specimen for cesarean scar pregnancy."
29953017," The current study was to examine the association of adequate intake of macronutrients and micronutrients with traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors in hemodialysis patients.A clinical cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2013 and April 2017 on 492 hemodialysis patients aged 20 years and above, received thrice-weekly hemodialysis treatment for at least 3 months, adequate dialysis quality (equilibrated Kt/V ≥ 1.2 g/kg/d) from 7 hospital-based hemodialysis centers in Taiwan. The dietary intake was evaluated by the 3-day dietary record, and a 24-hour dietary recall. Biochemical parameters were archived from laboratory tests. The cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors were defined by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines. The adequate dietary intake of macronutrients and micronutrients was recommended by the European Best Practice Guidelines, K/DOQI, and Institute of Medicine guidelines. Logistic regression analysis was used.All hemodialysis patients had CVD risks, the lowest proportion of patients with adequate intake of macronutrients and micronutrients were 8.7% and 1.8%, respectively. The adequate dietary intake associated with lower likelihood of having CVD risks in hemodialysis patient by 47% to 84%, including 39% to 58% lower hypertension, 37% to 50% lower dyslipidemia, 42% to 63% diabetes mellitus, 44% to 84% lower obesity, 58% lower low calcium, 38% lower hyperparathyroidism, 47% to 64% lower hyperhomocysteinemia, and 41% to 67% lower inflammation, 63% to 74% lower hypoalbumin, 73% lower inadequate normalized protein nitrogen appearance.Adequate dietary nutrients intake may reduce the cardiovascular risks factors, in turn, to prevent the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."
29953016," IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a chronic fibro-inflammatory disorder which is characterized by elevated levels of serum IgG4 and infiltration of IgG4-bearing plasma cells in the involved organs. Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) are both distinct from IgG4-related disease. We herein describe a Chinese patient with IgG4-related RPF overlapping with PBC and pSS. We report a case of 69-year-old male with recurrent lower abdominal pain for 10 months. Laboratory data showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and hepatobiliary enzymes, renal dysfunction, high titers of antinuclear antibody, anti-SS-A antibody and anti-mitochondrial type 2, high immunoglobulin (Ig) G levels and elevated serum IgG4 (9 g/L). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were suggestive of retroperitoneal fibrosis and unilateral ureteral occlusion. Immunohistochemical staining for IgG4 did not demonstrate infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells in the retroperitoneal mass, but revealed significant infiltration of lymphocytoplasma cells as well as fibrosis and fibrin accumulation. The patient was diagnosed with IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis based on the International Consensus Diagnostic Criteria. He was also diagnosed with primary biliary cirrhosis and primary Sjögren's syndrome. 250 mg ursodeoxycholic acid was administered twice daily, and prednisolone was initiated at a dose of 40 mg/day and then tapered to 25 mg after 45 days. The size of the retroperitoneal soft tissue mass gradually reduced and the abnormal laboratory parameters were restored to normal. This rare clinical condition has seldom been reported in the literature, which suggests that common immunogenetic factors may be involved in the development of IgG-related RPF, PBC and pSS."
29953015," To present an unusual extrapyramidal motor response occurring after a sympathetic block in CRPS and its successful treatment with diphenhydramine. Severe pain related to Complex Regional Pain Syndrome type 1 interfering with activities of daily living. Complex Regional Pain Syndrome type 1. We report a video case reports of two patients with a diagnosis of CRPS type-I. Both patients exhibited similar presentation of unusual extrapyramidal motor response of the affected limb following lumbar sympathetic block. Both patients were treated with intravenous diphenhydramine to abort the extrapyramidal motor response. Both patients similarly responded to treatment with intravenous diphenhydramine with abrupt resolution of the motor response. Sympathetic blockade may interfere with the adaptive autonomic reflex circuits of the motor balance homeostasis in patients with complex regional pain syndrome. Disinhibition of extrapyramidal system may lead to immediate expression of extrapyramidal signs following the sympathetic block. Diphenhydramine, with its anti-histaminic and anticholinergic properties, may be effective in aborting such extrapyramidal signs, and should be considered as a treatment option in similar cases."
29953014," Nonrestorative sleep (NRS) is one of the cardinal symptoms of insomnia and can occur independent of other components of insomnia. Among the sleep disturbances, NRS has been little studied in the general population, even though this symptom plays an important role in several medical conditions associated with chronic inflammation such as heart disease, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome, as well as various sleep disorders. There is paucity in the literature about effective treatments for NRS. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) has been demonstrated to reduce anxiety and stress, allowing the body to settle down and prepare for sleep. This study will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled interventional study in NRS population.The NRS participants are identified using Restorative Sleep Questionnaire-weekly version (RSQ-W) questionnaire. Actigraphy and polysomnography are used for the objective assessment of sleep. The other assessments used are Hamilton Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) scales, and C-reactive protein. Routine blood and urine analyses will be conducted to assess the safety of treatment. Duration of study for each participant will be 50 days with ""day one"" for screening followed by randomization for the treatment. The duration for medicine/placebo intake shall be 42 days.Primary outcome will be to evaluate effect of daily supplement of ashwagandha extract compared with placebo in subjects with NRS at 6 weeks from baseline, as assessed by the total score of RSQ-W. CTRI/2017/02/007801."
29953013," Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that includes motor and nonmotor symptoms. Sleep disturbance is known to decrease the quality of life in patients with PD, and there are limitations to the pharmacotherapy currently in use. Therefore, complementary treatment therapies are required to address these limitations. The traditional herbal medicines Yokukansan (YKS) and Yokukansankachimpihange (YKSCH) have been used to treat insomnia and night crying in children, suggesting their effectiveness against sleep disturbance in patients with PD. We will evaluate whether YKSCH improves sleep disturbance in PD and will identify YKS-related changes in hemodynamic parameters, and neurotransmitter and hormone levels in patients with PD experiencing sleep disturbance. We will conduct a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled parallel trial in 34 patients with PD and sleep disturbance, randomly allocating the patients to either placebo-control (n = 17) or treatment groups (n = 17). The total study period will be 16 weeks; administration of YKSCH or placebo, as intervention, will be performed for a 12-week period, and follow-up will be performed over a 4-week period. All subjects will undergo conventional treatment, and be required to maintain a regular medication schedule throughout the study period. The primary outcome measure will be the Scales for Outcomes in PD-Sleep Scale score, and the secondary outcome measures will be polysomnography results, findings from instruments related to sleep disorders, neurotransmitter and hormone levels, and hemodynamic changes in the brain cortex. This trial will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of YKSCH for sleep improvement in PD with sleep disturbance, and investigate the underlying mechanism of action. We expect improvement in the scores for subjective and objective sleep scales, hemodynamic changes in prefrontal cortical activity, and changes in neurotransmitter and hormone levels. The findings will provide insight into the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of YKSCH in PD, and lay the foundation for further studies on whether YKSCH improves sleep disturbance in PD.

29953012," Liver glomus tumor is very rare, and only 6 cases have been reported. Herein, we report another case of liver glomus tumor and the clinicopathological features are summarized. An 18-year-old male patient was admitted due to hypertension and arrhythmia for 4 days. Abdominal enhanced CT revealed a 6.0-cm solid and cystic mass in the left liver lobe. The mass was collected by hepatic lobectomy. Microscopically, the tumor cells were round or oval, and had no malignant features and no evident atypia. Immumohistochemically, tumor cells were positive for positive for SMA and vimentin, but partially positive for syn, CD34 and desmin. He was pathologically diagnosed with liver glomus tumor. The patient underwent a left hepatic lobectomy. After surgery, this patient was followed up for 6 months, and metastasis/recurrence was not observed. Primary liver glomus tumor has no specific clinical manifestations, and imaging examinations have limitations for its diagnosis. Immunostaining for SMA and vimentin is necessary to prove the diagnosis. Complete resection is strongly advised and it has a favorable prognosis."
29953011," Pancreatic lipidosis (nonalcoholic fatty pancreas disease, NAFPD) causes insulin resistance and dysfunction of pancreatic β-cells, with the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the prevalence and pathogenic factors associated with NAFPD are not clear. The aim of the study was to explore the prevalence of NAFPD in a Chinese adult population, and investigate factors associated with NAFPD aggravation.This was a cross-sectional study; 4419 subjects were enrolled for NAFPD screening and were divided into NAFPD (n = 488) and without NAFPD (n = 3930) groups. The sex, age, related concomitant diseases, general physical parameters, and serum glucose and lipid metabolism were compared between the 2 groups.The overall NAFPD prevalence was 11.05%, but increased with age. In those <55 years NAFPD prevalence was lower in females than males (P < .05), but prevalence was similar >55 years. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), T2DM, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index, total cholesterol, triglyceride, lipoprotein, adiponectin, and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) were the independent risk factors for NAFPD (P < .05). Analaysis of mild NAFPD (MN) and severe NAFPD (SN) subgroups, according to the extent of fat deposition, suggested that NAFLD, triglyceride, lipoprotein, and adiponectin were independent risk factors for NAFPD aggravation (P < .05).The NAFPD prevalence was about 11% in Chinese adults. Its development and progression was related to NAFLD, T2DM, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and GLP-1 levels. Severe NAFPD was associated with NAFLD and dyslipidemia."
29953010," The current methods of monitoring the activity of lupus nephritis (LN) may cause unnecessary hospital visits or delayed immunosuppressive therapy. We aimed to find a urinary biomarker that could be developed as a home-based test for monitoring the activity of LN.Urine samples were collected immediately before a renal biopsy from patients of suspected active LN, and also from patients with inactive LN, systemic lupus erythematous without LN or healthy controls. Biomarker search was conducted on a cytokine antibody array and confirmation was done by quantitative evaluation with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The Mann-Whiney test or Student t test was used to compare the levels of 9 cytokines between different groups. The sensitivity and specificity of each cytokine for diagnosis of LN was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve. A rapid test based on colloidal gold immunochromatography was then developed for bedside or home use. Furthermore, an experimental e-healthcare system was constructed for recording and sharing the results of the rapid test a cloud-assisted internet of things (IoT) consisting of a sensing device, an IoT device and a cloud server.Adiponectin (Acrp30), soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM-1), and CD26 were significantly higher in urine samples of active LN patients. sICAM-1 appeared more sensitive and specific among these candidates. When the cut-off value of sICAM-1 was set at 1.44 ng/mL, the sensitivity reached 98.33% with a specificity at 85.71%. The sICAM-1 strip test showed comparable sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 83.3% for assessing the LN activity. Meanwhile, the e-healthcare system was able to conveniently digitize and share the sICAM-1 rapid test results.sICAM-1 appeared to be an excellent biomarker for monitoring LN activity. The e-healthcare system with cloud-assisted IoT could assist the digitalization and sharing of the bedside or home-based sICAM-1 test results."
29953009," Rhabdomyolysis owing to status epilepticus (SE) can be life-threating, with acute kidney injury (AKI) the most serious complication; therefore, early recognition of the risk factors is important. Hyperuricemia after epileptic seizures has been reported, and severe hyperuricemia can lead to acute renal function damage. We present the case of a 21-year-old man hospitalized for SE, who had especially high level of blood uric acid (UA) at initial presentation. The patient was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis due to SE. The patient was treated with hydration and bicarbonate therapy. But he developed acute kidney failure (AKF) and hemodialysis was performed. After hemodialysis, his symptoms disappeared and laboratory data returned to normal. Hyperuricemia after SE might indicate severe muscle damage or reduced clearance of metabolites, and could be a risk factor for kidney dysfunction, especially with rhabdomyolysis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of rhabdomyolysis following SE with hyperuricemia."
29953008," Laryngeal cysts are rare lesions that may occur at any mucosa-lined location within the larynx. Papillomas are also benign lesions of the larynx. We report a 34 year-old-patient with a laryngeal cyst incidentally found during screening endoscopy and presenting as a soft tissue mass on a computerized tomography scan. A papilloma concomitant with the cyst was detected intraoperatively. Concomitant tonsillar cyst and papilloma of the larynx. The lesion was completely resected with a bipolar radiofrequency plasma ablation (RFA) device. Pathologic examination showed a tonsillar cyst and papilloma in the larynx. Six months later, there has been no evidence of recurrence. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a concomitant tonsillar cyst and a papilloma in the larynx. Asymptomatic laryngeal cysts can be detected endoscopically. RFA is safe and effective for endoscopic management."
29953007," To identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features in the prediction of tumor aggressiveness in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).In this prospective study, 105 patients with 122 PTCs underwent MRI with T1-weighted, T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted imaging and contrast-enhanced sequences prior to thyroidectomy. Based on exclusion criteria, 62 patients with 62 PTCs were finally suitable for further analysis. Tumor aggressiveness was defined according to the surgical histopathology. Tumor size, apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) value and MRI features on images were obtained for each patient. Descriptive statistics for tumor aggressiveness, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of individual features were determined. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to identify features that were independently predictive for tumor aggressiveness. Analyses of receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed.High aggressive PTC significantly differed from low aggressive PTC in size (P = .016), size classification (P < .001), ADC value (P = .01), angulation on the lateral surface of the lesion (P = .009), signal intensity heterogeneity on ADC maps (P = .003), early enhancement degree (P < .001), tumor margin on delayed contrast-enhanced images (P < .001), and inner lining of delayed ring enhancement (P = .028). The interobserver agreement between the 2 readers was satisfactory with Cohen k ranging from 0.83 to 1.00 (P < .001). Logistic regression model showed lesion size classification and tumor margin on delayed contrast-enhanced images as strongest independent predictors of high aggressive PTC (P = .009 and P = .047), with an accuracy of 83.9%. The area under ROC curve for ADC value and lesion size were 0.68 and 0.81, respectively.These findings suggest that MRI before surgery has the potential to discriminate tumor aggressiveness in patients with PTC."
29953006," Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is a chronic, degenerative cardiac condition. Although MAC is often considered as an incidental finding in clinical and forensic practice, sudden death due to severe MAC with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during hemodialysis is uncommon. In addition, spontaneous subepicardial hematoma due to rupture of the subepicardial vein is very rare. A 65-year-old woman had a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and renal failure. Postmortem examination revealed marked MAC with cardiomegaly and ESRD. Spontaneous subepicardial hematoma due to disruption of subepicardial vein was also seen. The patient became short of breath while on hemodialysis and expired en route to the hospital. In this case, death was attributed to the effects of the calcified mitral valve annulus. This case highlights that MAC must be considered in any patient with ESRD and fatal cardiovascular events should not be overlooked in these patients."
29953005," The association of XPA rs1800975 polymorphism with breast cancers has been reported in several studies, but the results were conflicting. In order to analyze the association between XPA rs1800975 polymorphism and the risk of breast cancer, a meta-analysis was performed in the present study. The literature search for relevant studies was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Med Online databases. The odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using fixed-effect/random-effects models by the STATA 12.0 software. The sources of heterogeneity were analyzed by subgroup analysis. Six case-control studies involving 5069 subjects (2338 patients and 2731 healthy controls) were included in the present meta-analysis. In the pooled analysis, no obvious association was found between XPA rs1800975 polymorphism and the risk of breast cancer in all genetic models. However, in subgroup analysis based on ethnicity, XPA rs1800975 polymorphism was found to be related to decreased breast cancer risk in non-Asians in the recessive model (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.64-1.00, P = .045). Moreover, source of control subgroup analysis demonstrated that XPA rs1800975 polymorphism might decrease the risk of breast cancer in population-based group in the recessive model (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.64-1.00, P = .045). XPA rs1800975 polymorphism may decrease the risk of breast cancer in both non-Asians and population-based patients. Large sample size and well-designed study is needed for further assessing the role of XPA polymorphism in breast cancer risk."
29953004," Ingested esophageal foreign bodies are commonly seen in adult population. In very few instances, esophageal foreign body may pass through the mucosal surface, re-epithelialize or migrate into surrounding soft tissues. A 55-year-old Chinese male was admitted to our hospital with a 10-day history chest and upper abdominal pain without dysphasia, cough or other symptoms. We initially suspected chronic gastritis, and thoracic computed tomography and endoscopy ultrasonography (EUS) were used to identify a fish bone completely embedded within the lower esophageal wall. Under the EUS-guidance, we marked the foreign body using methylene blue with saline solution, which was followed by successful thoracoscopy and surgical removed of the foreign body. The patient recovered well and was discharged 1 week postoperatively. One month postoperatively, the patient was symptom free and the chest wound was complete healed. Our case showed that computed tomography is necessary to diagnose the esophageal foreign body, and EUS may help confirm the position of foreign body, especially those embedded in the esophageal submucosa. We advocate necessary surgery at the first accurate diagnosis in patient with esophageal foreign body when endoscopy is not possible."
29953003," T1 breast cancer patients have favorable clinical outcomes, so that whether axillary stating (AS) surgery can be omitted in these patients is still unclear. This retrospective cohort study developed a nomogram to predict the cancer-specific survival (CSS) of T1 breast cancer patients with and without AS and estimate the survival benefit of AS in these patients.We used surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database to identify 232,195 breast cancer patients with T1 tumors diagnosed between 1990 and 2008. In the training cohort, we used the Kaplan-Meier method and the competing risk analysis, with non-CSS as the competing risk, to screen for prognostic factors for CSS. A nomogram to predict the CSS, with receiving AS or not as one of the predictors, was developed and externally validated, using the C-index and calibration plots. The survival benefit of AS can be estimated by the difference of 2 predicted CSS, when the patient was considered as having and not having AS.With a median follow-up of 109 months, the CSS of the study population were 96.3%, 92.3%, and 88.5% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Significant predictors for CSS identified in the training cohort were used to develop a nomogram, which was validated internally [C-index = 0.707, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.702-0.712] and externally (C-index = 0.704, 95% CI 0.698-0.710). The nomogram was well calibrated. With this nomogram, AS was predicted to have less than 2% benefit of 5-, 10-, and 15-year CSS in 60.6% (140,599/232,195), 15.5% (36,074/232,195), and 8.6% (20,043/232,195) of the entire study population, respectively.The new nomogram can accurately predict the CSS of T1 breast cancer patients, and also be able to estimate the survival benefit of AS in these patients. Prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings."
29953002," Primary central nervous system histiocytic sarcoma (PCNSHS) is a rare lymphohematopoietic tumor with a histiocytic cell origin. To our knowledge, only 28 cases have been published in English and 2 cases in Chinese. A 49-year-old Asian female presented to the hospital with a 2 month history of hypomnesia, odynophagia, and gait disorder. Physical examination demonstrated decreased lower extremity muscle strength. The patient denied a history of malignancy. Radiology demonstrated a lesion in parietal lobe with uniformenhancement. Histologic analysis showed pleomorphic tumor cells with a loose arrangement, effacing the normal brain tissue. The tumor cells exhibited abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, highly atypical nuclei and predominant nucleoli. Immunohistochemistry revealed positive immunoreactivity for CD45, lysozyme, CD68, and CD163, and negative for pan-cytokeratin (CK), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), CD3, CD20, CD1a, CD79a, CD138, oligodendrocyte transcription factor (olig2), CD15, melan-A, CD30, CD21, CD35, Human Melanoma Black-45 (HMB45), and anaplastic lymphoma kinase-1 (ALK-1). The diagnosis of PCNSHS was rendered. The patient underwent complete surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy. Follow-up information shows the patient died 8 months following the initial diagnosis. PCNSHS is extremely rare with an aggressive clinical course. Immunohistiochemistry is necessary to make this diagnosis and to exclude other primary intracranial and lymphohematopoietic tumors. Further research is required to improve the outcome of patients with PCNSHS."
29953001," This retrospective study examined the effect of voice rehabilitation training (VRT) for patients with laryngeal cancer (LC) after radiotherapy.Eighty-three eligible patients with LC were included. Forty-three patients were assigned to a treatment group, and underwent VRT, while the other 40 subjects were assigned to a control group, and were at waiting list. Primary outcome was measured by the Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain (GRBAS) scale. Secondary outcome was measured by Patient Perception Measures. All outcomes were measured before and 3 months after VRT intervention.Patients in the treatment group did not show better outcomes, measured by GRBAS scale (Grade, P = .78; Roughness, P = .61; Breathiness, P = .83; Ashenia, P = .89; and Strain, P = .41), and Patient Perception Measures (Vocal quality, P = .17; Acceptability, P = .35; Hoarseness, P = .23; Vocal fatigue, P = .39; and Ashamed, P = .51), compared with patients in the control group.The results of this study did not exert better outcomes in patients received VRT than those at waiting list."
29953000," This retrospective study evaluated the effect of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) for the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain (EAP).A total of 154 patients with EAP were included and were divided into 2 groups in this retrospective study. Eighty-three patients were assigned a treatment group, and underwent NMES therapy, while 71 subjects in the control group were at waiting list. The primary outcome of pain was measured by the numerical rating scale (NRS) and the Endometriosis Symptom Severity scale (ESSS). The secondary outcome was quality of life, measured by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). All outcomes were measured before and after 5-week and 10-week treatment. Moreover, we also recorded the adverse events in this study.After 5-week treatment, no significant differences in all outcome measurements were found between the 2 groups. However, after 10-week treatment, NMES therapy exerted better outcomes in NRS (P = .02), ESSS (P = .04), and SF-36 [Physical Component Summary (PCS), P < .01; Mental Component Summary (MCS), P < .01], compared with the patients at the waiting list. Moreover, no significant differences of all adverse events were found between the 2 groups, although mild and acceptable adverse events occurred in the treatment group.This study demonstrated that NMES is effective for treating patients with EAP."
29952999," This retrospective study evaluated the effect of using neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) for the treatment of post-stroke urinary incontinence (PSUI) among female population in China.A total of 163 eligible patients with PSUI were included in this study. Of these, 103 patients were assigned to a treatment group, and 60 subjects were assigned to a control group. All patients in both groups received bladder training. In addition, patients in the treatment group also received NMES. All patients were treated for a total of 8 weeks. The outcome measurements included the amount of urine leakage, urinary symptoms and quality of life. The urinary symptoms were measured by the Bristol Female Urinary Symptoms Questionnaire (BFUSQ) score, and the quality of life was assessed by the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) score. In addition, adverse events were also documented in this study.After 4-week treatment, patients who received NMES did not exert better outcomes in the amount of urine leakage, urinary symptoms, measured by BFUSQ scale, and the quality of life, assessed by ICIQ-SF scale. However, after 8-week treatment, patients in the treatment group showed greater effect in reducing the amount of urine leakage (P < .01), enhancing urinary symptoms, as measured by BFUSQ scale (P < .01), and improving the quality of life, as assessed by ICIQ-SF scale (P < .01), compared with patients in the control group. In addition, no adverse event was recorded during the period of 8-week treatment in this study.The results of this study indicated that NMES may benefit for patients with PSUI after 8-week treatment. Future studies should focus on warranting the results of this study."
29952998," We aimed to assess the accuracy of self-assessment for acute stroke patients via mobile phone application-based scales and determine the value and prospect of clinical use.A cross-sectional study was designed and acute stroke patients were enrolled. We pushed the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and activities of daily living (ADL) scale to patients via mobile phone application for self-assessment on the day before they were out of hospital. We compared the results from nurse assessment and self-assessment.Around 50 patients with the average age 51.72 ± 12.40 completed the self-assessment. A total of 27 patients self-assessed the scales, while caregivers of other 23 patients completed the assessment. In comparison with patient assessment and nurse assessment, significant difference was found in ADL score (P = .004), but was not found in mRS score (P > .05). When comparing caregiver assessment with nurse assessment, no significant difference could be found either in ADL score (P > .05) or in mRS score (P > .05). The kappa value for self-assessment and nurse agreement of ADL was 0.720 (P = .000), with sensitivity 96.8% and specificity 82.0%. The kappa value for self-assessment and nurse agreement of mRS was 0.718 (P = .000), with sensitivity 97.6% and specificity 92.4%.In summary, mobile phone application-based scales are generally accurate, economical and convenient for self-assessment of acute stroke patients with acceptable reliability in our small scale study. Caregivers can serve as the proper assessor when patients are out of hospital. Therefore, it is promising but still need to be further confirmed how practical to use this application in extended care and follow-up."
29952997," The aim of the study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of epidural analgesia and transverse abdominis plane (TAP) block. TAP block has gained popularity to provide postoperative analgesia after abdominal surgery but its advantage over epidural analgesia is disputed. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines. Only trials comparing TAP block with epidural analgesia were included. The primary outcome was pain score at rest (analog scale, 0-10) on postoperative day 1 analyzed in subgroups according to the population (children and adults). Secondary outcomes included rate of hypotension, length of stay, and functional outcomes (time to first bowel sound, time to first flatus). Ten controlled trials, including 505 patients (195 children and 310 adults), were identified. Pain scores at rest on postoperative day 1 were equivalent for TAP block and epidural analgesia groups in children (mean difference: 0.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.1 to 0.6; I = 0%; P = .15) and in adults (mean difference: 0.5; 95% CI: -0.1 to 1.0; I = 81%; P = .10). The quality of evidence for our primary outcome was moderate according to the GRADE system. The epidural analgesia group experienced a higher rate of hypotension (relative risk: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.04-0.38; I = 0%; P = .0002), while hospital length of stay was shorter in the TAP block group (mean difference: -0.6 days; 95% CI: -0.9 to -0.3 days; I = 0%; P < .0001), without impact on functional outcomes. There is moderate evidence that TAP block and epidural analgesia are equally effective in treating postoperative pain in both pediatric and adult patients, while TAP block is associated with fewer episodes of hypotension and reduced length of stay."
29952996," This retrospective study investigated the effect of smoking cessation intervention (SCI) among university students in China.Around 192 eligible smokers among university students were included, and were assigned to an intervention group (n = 100), and a control group (n = 92). All included subjects in both groups were recommended to increase fruits and vegetables consumptions. Additionally, participants in the intervention group also underwent SCI therapy for a total of 4 weeks. The outcome measurements consisted of a number of students quit smoking, daily cigarettes, quit attempts, mean days of smoking in the past 30 days, and also stage of change.After 4-week treatment, SCI neither can decrease the number of students quit smoking (P = .21), daily cigarettes (P = .21), quit attempts (P = .07), and mean days of smoking in past 30 days (P = .77), nor can enhance the stage of change (precontemplation, P = .18; contemplation, P = .59; preparation, P = .46).The results of this study showed that after 4-week therapy, SCI may be ineffective for smokers among university students in Chinese."
29952995," Smooth emergence or cough prevention is a clinically important concern in patients undergoing laryngomicroscopic surgery (LMS). The purpose of this study was to estimate the effective concentration of remifentanil in 95% of patients (EC95) for the prevention of emergence cough after LMS under propofol anesthesia using the biased coin design (BCD) up-down method.A total of 40 adult patients scheduled to undergo elective LMS were enrolled. Anesthesia induction and maintenance were performed with target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. Effective effect-site concentration (Ce) of remifentanil in 95% of patients for preventing emergence cough was estimated using a BCD method (starting from 1 ng/mL with a step size of 0.4 ng/mL). Hemodynamic and recovery profiles were observed after anesthesia.According to the study protocol, 20 patients were allocated to receive remifentanil Ce of 3.0 ng/mL, and 20 patients were assigned to receive lower concentrations of remifentanil, from 1.0 to 2.6 ng/mL. Based on isotonic regression with a bootstrapping method, EC95 (95% CI) of remifentanil Ce for the prevention of emergence cough from LMS was found to be 2.92 ng/mL (2.72-2.97 ng/mL). Compared with patients receiving lower concentrations of remifentanil, the incidence of hypoventilation before extubation and extubation time were significantly higher in those receiving remifentanil Ce of 3.0 ng/mL. However, hypoventilation incidence after extubation and staying time in the recovery room were comparable between the 2 groups.Using a BCD method, the EC95 of remifentanil Ce for the prevention of emergence cough was estimated to be 2.92 ng/mL (95% CI: 2.72-2.97 ng/mL) after LMS under propofol anesthesia."
29952994," Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with cystic liver metastases is so rarely observed that there are only three cases reported in the published literature. We present a case of NPC that received complete response after chemotherapy and definitive radiotherapy, but a liver cystic lesion was revealed on abdominal sonogram three months after the initial therapy. The cystic liver lesion initially resembled a simple liver cyst with fast growth, and then evolved into an abscess-like mass after a short term. Though abscess drainage was performed, and the mass shrank significantly, but it returned to previous size two months later. Surgical resection was administrated both for diagnosis and treatment, and eventually the lesion was histologically demonstrated to be a liver metastasis. Eight months after the partial hepatectomy, cystic liver metastases recurred on computed tomography (CT) scan. Though palliative systematic chemotherapy including paclitaxel, cisplatin, gemcitabine, navobine and anti-epidemal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) molecular-targeted therapy were performed, the cystic metastases still gradually progressed. Then Transcatheter Hepatic Artery Chemoembolization (TACE) was administrated for five times, and all the lesions were obviously decreased in size. After TACE treatment, the liver metastases maintained stable for six months, but lung metastases were noted. Finally, the patient died of liver failure. The rare cystic appearance may be a special form which exists for liver metastases of NPC, indicating poor prognosis. Oncologists need to enhance the recognition and diagnosis level of this type of metastases. Intense follow-up and early diagnosis are important. While emphasizing the importance of local therapy and personal principles for liver metastases, TACE may be a preferred method for unresectable cystic liver metastases from NPC."
29952993," Few studies have investigated the dry needling (DN) approach on knee osteoarthritis (KO) patients. The study's aim was to evaluate the short-term efficacy of adding DN to a therapeutic exercise protocol in the treatment of KO in older adults. A double-blind, pilot clinical trial with parallel groups [NCT02698072] was carried out for 12 weeks of treatment and follow-up. Twenty patients aged 65 years and older with myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in the muscles of the thigh were recruited from older-adult care centers and randomly assigned to a DN + Exercise group or a Sham-DN + Exercise group. The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS; primary outcome) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire (WOMAC) were assessed before and after the intervention. The NRS (analysis of variance, ANOVA) showed statistically significant differences in the time factor (F = 53.038; P < .0001; ηp = 0.747). However, it did not show a significant change in the group-time interaction (F = 0.082; P = .777; ηp = 0.005). The WOMAC scores (ANOVA) showed statistically significant differences in the time factor for total score WOMAC questionnaire (F = 84.826; P < .0001; ηp = 0.825), WOMAC pain (F = 90.478; P < .0001; ηp = 0.834), WOMAC stiffness (F = 14.556; P < .001; ηp = 0.447), and WOMAC function (F = 70.872; P < .0001; ηp = 0.797). However, it did not show a statistically significant change in the group-time interaction. Despite the pain intensity and disability clinically relevant improvement for both DN and Sham-DN combined with exercise, 6 sessions of DN added to a therapeutic exercise program for older adults with KO did not seem to improve pain intensity and functionality."
29952992," Available data concerning the association between RAD51 135G/C (rs1801320) polymorphism and the risk of 3 common gynecological cancers still could not reach a consensus. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to explore the relationship. Several electronic databases and bibliographies of relevant articles were screened to identify the studies up to July 2017. Then a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the connection between 3 common gynecological tumors' susceptibility and RAD51 135G/C polymorphism in different inheritance models. Simultaneously, we did subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis if necessary. A total of 11 articles including 14 studies involving 4097 cases and 5890 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, RAD51 135G/C polymorphism increased the risk of 3 common gynecological tumors. The subgroup analysis stratified by cancer types- endometrial carcinoma (EC) and ovarian cancer (OC)-showed that RAD51 135G/C polymorphism increased the risk of EC: allele model (C vs G: odds ratio [OR] = 4.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.63-7.10, P < .00001), dominant model (CC + GC vs GG: OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.44-3.60, P = .004), recessive model (CC vs GC + GG: OR = 10.27, 95% CI = 14.71-22.38, P < .00001), and homozygous model (CC vs GG: OR = 7.26, 95% CI = 3.59-14.68, P < .00001), but there was no significant association between RAD51 135G/C polymorphism and OC. In the subgroup analysis stratified by source of controls, a significantly increased risk was observed in hospital-based studies. Nevertheless, the data showed RAD51 135G/C polymorphism had no link in population-based studies. This meta-analysis suggested that RAD51 135G/C polymorphism was a risk factor for the three common gynecological tumors, especially for EC among hospital-based populations."
29952991," Low back pain (LBP) is a common complaint among patients presenting to emergency department (ED) in Singapore. The STarT Back Screening Tool (SBT) was recently developed and validated for triage of LBP patients in primary care settings. This study aimed to investigate whether the SBT could provide prognostic information for long-term outcomes of acute LBP patients visiting the ED, who might benefit from appropriate and timely management at an earlier stage.Data were collected in a prospective observational cohort study from 177 patients who consulted emergency physicians for acute LBP and completed 6-month follow-up. Patients were administered the SBT and assessed at baseline. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 6 weeks and 6 months.A multiple linear regression model incorporating SBT total score, age, employment status, LBP history, and 6-week pain score was constructed to predict 6-month pain score. In the model, SBT total score and 6-week pain score were significantly associated with 6-month pain score (P < .05) with respective coefficients of 0.125 and 0.500. The model explained 40.1% of the variance for 6-month pain score.This study demonstrated that the multiple linear regression model showed predictive performance in determining long-term outcomes for acute LBP patients presenting to the ED."
29952990," Graft insertion into the anterior chamber is one of the most important procedures for successful Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK). Especially in eyes with fragile zonular fibers and a shallow anterior chamber, smooth graft insertion tends to become more difficult. Ophthalmic viscoelastic devices (OVDs) can usually help to retain the space in the anterior chamber and to improve the safety of manipulations during various ophthalmic surgeries. Therefore, we postulated that graft insertion into the anterior chamber could be improved by their use. The purpose of this study is to investigate the availability and efficacy of OVDs during graft insertion in DMEK surgery.A total of 11 eyes of 9 patients with bullous keratopathy who underwent DMEK were retrospectively analyzed. The cause of bullous keratopathy was corneal endothelial decompensation following laser iridotomy in all eyes. We used low viscous dispersive OVD (Opegan) to maintain the anterior chamber depth during graft insertion in all of the eyes.The graft insertion was uneventful in all of the eyes. The inserted graft was attached to the back surface of the cornea. However, 2 eyes needed rebubbling, and after rebubbling, all of the 2 grafts completely attached to the back surface of the cornea. The best spectacle-corrected visual acuity significantly improved 6 months after surgery (P < .001) and the central corneal thickness significantly decreased (P < .001).The use of OVD facilitates safer graft insertion during DMEK, and subsequently prevents endothelial cell loss, which leads to a successful procedure."
29952989," Intermediate screw fixation at the fracture level has been widely accepted to treat thoracolumbar burst fractures, but no study has shown the effect of the extent and location of fixation. The effect of the extent and location of fixation on short- or long-segment pedicle screw fixation through intermediate screw fixation at the fracture level in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures is discussed.Posterior intermediate screw fixation techniques in treating T12 vertebral fracture models were simulated and compared using finite element methods; the fixation techniques included M3-L1 (bilateral 3 monoaxial pedicle screw fixation from L1 to T11), M3-L2, M4-L1 (bilateral 4 monoaxial pedicle screw fixation from L1 to T10), M4-L2, M4-L3, and M5-L2 (bilateral 5 monoaxial pedicle screw fixation from L2 to T10). Range of motion (ROM) and largest von Mises stress (LVMS) of the instrumentations were recorded and analyzed.No significant differences were observed in the mean ROM of all states of motion between the M3-L1 model and the other fixation models except for M5-L2. The LVMS of the pedicle screws and rods all occurred during flexion. The LVMS values of the pedicle screws were larger in the M3-L2 fixation model and M4-L3 fixation model than in the other fixation models. The M3-L1 model presented a significantly smaller mean LVMS of the pedicle screws in all states of motion than the M3-L2 model (P = .026). The LVMS values of the rods were larger in the M3-L2 fixation model, M4-L3 fixation model, and M4-L2 fixation model than in the other fixation models. No significant differences were observed in the mean LVMS of the rods in all states of motion among all the fixation models.When choosing short-segment pedicle screw fixation with the screwing of fractured vertebrae to treat thoracolumbar fractures, we suggest M3-L1 over M3-L2. More severe injuries can be considered to identify an alternative treatment to long-segment monoaxial pedicle fixation constructs such as the M4-L1 and M5-L2 techniques."
29952988," Pharyngeal foreign bodies are a common complaint in emergent cases, and sometimes can be lethal. A large variety of foreign bodies may lodge in the pharynx. We present a case of uncommon foreign body in the hypopharynx. A 9-month-old boy presented for an hour of crying associated with having congee. No abnormality was revealed in physical examination or cervicothoracic computed tomography (CT) scan. Flexible laryngoscopy showed a size tag on the posterior hypopharyngeal wall. Foreign body in the hypopharynx. The foreign body was removed from the hypopharynx. The patient was discharged after the removal of the foreign body. Infants with foreign bodies in the hypopharynx may presented with no obvious clinical manifestation. Pharyngeal foreign bodies may be the potential for disastrous consequences. Otolaryngologists should pay attention to these foreign bodies."
29952987," Default-mode network (DMN) plays a key role in a broad-scale cognitive problem, which occurs in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, little is known about the alterations of the network homogeneity (NH) of DMN in TLE. In the present study, we employed NH method to investigate the NH of DMN in TLE at rest.A total of 47 patients with TLE (right TLE [rTLE] 29, and left TLE [lTLE] 18) and 35 healthy controls who underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were enrolled. NH approach was used to analyze the data.rTLE exhibited decreased NH in the right middle temporal pole gyrus and increased NH in the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex compared to the control group. In lTLE, decreased NH was observed in left inferior temporal gyrus and left hippocampus. Meanwhile, we found that lTLE had a longer performance reaction time. No significant correlation was found between abnormal NH values and clinical variables in the patients.These findings suggested that abnormal NH of the DMN exists in rTLE and lTLE, and highlighted the significance of DMN in the pathophysiology of cognitive problems occurring in TLE and also found the existence of abnormality of executive function in lTLE."
29952986," Bile is aseptic; under conditions of no external influx, there is a less than 30% chance of isolating bacteria even in acute cholecystitis. This study was conducted to evaluate the incidence of biliary microflora and most common biliary microflora and resistance to antibiotics in patients with cholecystitis, as well as predict situations that do not require the use of prophylactic antibiotics.Bile samples were collected for culture using standard methods during all cholecystectomies performed from January 2015 to December 2015 in the Department of Surgery, Pusan National University Hospital. A total of 366 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed during the study period. In 215 patients, bile culture was performed and cultures were positive in 54 cases. Prophylactic antibiotics with 2nd-generation cephalosporin were administered once 30 minutes before surgery. According to the results of bile culture, patients were divided into 2 groups, culture-negative and culture-positive groups. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors were compared between groups.The culture positive group was older (P = .000). The number of patients with performance of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), performance of percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD), presence of symptoms, presence of operative complications, and hospital stay was significantly higher in the culture-positive group than in culture-negative group. In multivariate analysis of factors associated with positive culture, age, ERCP, and symptoms were independent factors affecting positive bile culture. Eighty-five bacteria were identified in 54 patients. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella were common in gram-negative bacteria. Enterococcus was the most common in gram-positive bacteria. Less than 5% resistance was observed against carbapenem, beta-lactam antibiotics, glycopeptide antibiotics, and linezolid.The bile of patients with laparoscopic cholecystectomy may contain microorganisms, particularly elderly patients, those with symptoms, and those who undergo preoperative ERCP. When ERCP was performed, multiple bacteria culture-positive results were more likely to be found. Although carbapenem, beta-lactam antibiotics, glycopeptide antibiotics, and linezolid may be suitable prophylactic antibiotics, additional studies of the clinical aspects of culture-positive bile is needed to determine the importance of bacterial growth in bile."
29952985," Toxoplasma gondii is distributed worldwide, infecting a large population. It can cause focal necrotic retinitis or retinochoroiditis in the human eyes and is one of the most common causes of posterior uveitis. A 68-year-old patient with normal immunity was complained about blurred vision and black shadow in the right eye for 1 week. Combined Yellow-and-white bulged lesions in the fundus of the right eye with the Goldmann-Witmer coefficient = 2 and based on the serological indicators, we considered the diagnosis of T. gondii infection-induced retinochondritis. Acetylspiramycin 0.4 QID × 3 weeks, concussive 20 days treatment after 3 days, for a total of 3 months, prednisone 20 mg/day with a weekly reduction of 5 mg for 1 month. After oral acetylspiramycin, topical and systemic corticosteroids for 3 months, the retinal lesions were scarred, and inflammation of the anterior chamber and vitreum disappeared. After a 9-month follow-up, the visual acuity was 0.6, and no active lesions were observed in the fundus. The immunocompetent elderly who are in contact with domestic cats may have an opportunistic infection with toxoplasmosis leading to primary retinochoroiditis. Prompt diagnosis and effective treatment can get a good clinical prognosis."
29952984," Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a rare complication of the paclitaxel. However, the pathophysiology was unknown. A 60-year-old female presented with bilateral blurred vision due to cystoid macular edema after taking 12-course paclitaxel for her breast cancer. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography (FAG), indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), electroretinogram (ERG) and electrooculogram (EOG) were performed. Paclitaxel-induced macular edema. Paclitaxel was discontinued and supportive treatment with pentoxifylline was given. The OCT showed bilateral cystoid macular edema. Impaired filling of choriocapillaries was noted on the ICGA; while EOG revealed decreased Arden ratio. The visual acuity, cystoid macular edema and decreased Arden ratio improved slowly over six months. Paclitaxel rarely causes cystoid macular edema. The damage of choriocapillaries and retinal pigment epithelium might be the underlying cause. Immediate discontinuation of the drug helps visual recovery."
29952983," The ancient infectious diseases, Lemierre's Syndrome and Bezold's Abscesses are rare. A 70-year-old Japanese woman with a 15-year history of Parkinson's disease was referred to our hospital due to fever, occipital headache and bilateral shoulder pain that had continued for three months. She had been prescribed prednisolone due to a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica. A blood culture revealed bacteremia of Streptococcus constellatus. In addition, computed tomography revealed Bezold's abscesses and Lemierre's syndrome. We administered ceftriaxone for 31 days, followed by oral amoxicillin. The patient recovered and the abscesses improved. This case underscores the importance of blood culture tests and cross-referencing with radiological imagings in the diagnoses of these rare critical infectious diseases that mimic polymyalgia rheumatica."
29952982," The aim of this study is to cross-culturally adapt and translate the original version of SPADI into Chinese (C-SPADI), and to test the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the C-SPADI.This research was a test of previously developed diagnostic criteria in a series of consecutive patients with universally applied gold standard. The original version was translated into Chinese according to international recognized standards. Patients who were diagnosed with a shoulder disorder and underwent shoulder arthroscopic treatments from 2014 to 2015 were enrolled in our study. Each participant was asked to finish the C-SPADI, the Short-Form 36 (SF-36), and the Oxford Shoulder score (OSS) at first visit. The C-SPADI was completed a second time with an interval of 7 days. Six months after arthroscopic treatments, the C-SPADI was completed a third time for responsiveness evaluation. The Cronbach alpha, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), minimally detectable change (MDC), Pearson correlation coefficient (r), effect size (ES), and standardized response mean (SRM) were calculated to evaluate the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of C-SPADI respectively.The original version of the SPADI was well adapted and translated into Chinese. The Cronbach alpha ranged from 0.812 to 0.912 in all subscales and total scale of the C-SPADI, indicating good or excellent internal consistency. The test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.887-0.915, SEM = 5.47, MDC = 15.16) was proved to be good or excellent. Moderate or good correlations (r = 0.556-0.672) were obtained between the C-SPADI and the OSS, physical subscales of SF-36; and poor, fair, or moderate correlations (r = 0.038-0.492) were obtained between the C-SPADI and mental subscales of SF-36, which, adequately illustrated good discriminant validity in the C-SPADI. Additionally, the responsiveness was considered good in the C-SPADI (SRM = 1.58-2.44, ES = 1.79-2.17).The C-SPADI was documented to be a reliable, valid, and responsible instrument for self-assessment of patients with shoulder disorders in China. Level II."
29952981," Maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) is reportedly useful for evaluating regional lymph nodes (RLNs) of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to predict malignancy. However, it is difficult for clinicians to measure SUVmax (mSUVmax) as calculated by a workstation.We assessed the utility of simplified SUVmax (sSUVmax) in screening RLNs for pathologic malignancy. The highest color was visually defined in the region of interest. The resulting color can be quantified using the color bar, and interpreted as sSUVmax. Patients in respiratory medicine and surgery who underwent both contrast-enhanced CT and FDG-PET/CT within 3 months before radical lobectomy were evaluated retrospectively. The correlation was examined by regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses.Participants comprised 69 patients with NSCLC treated between May 2009 and April 2016. Medical group comprised 22 patients from respiratory medicine. The prediction model could be written as a linear relationship (mSUVmax = 1.019 × sSUVmax; R = 0.930). A total of 316 RLNs resected by surgery in total cohort were pathologically determined. From ROC curves, area under curve for sSUVmax was 0.72 (95% confidence interval, 0.61-0.83; P < .0002). The cutoff sSUVmax was 2.42 (sensitivity, 52%; specificity, 88%; accuracy, 85%).The sSUVmax allows quantification of colors from FDG-PET/CT and shows a close correlation to mSUVmax. This value may have potential in screening for RLNs, and thoracic clinicians can readily determine the value. These findings may facilitate better planning of therapeutic strategy in the real world."
29952980," To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dry needling (DN) for treating low back pain (LBP). Nine databases were searched from inception to October 2017. Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving DN for treating LBP were retrieved. Two reviewers independently screened the articles, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias among the included studies using the risk of bias assessment tool by Cochrane Collaboration. Sixteen RCTs were included and the risk of bias assessment of them was ""high"" or ""unclear"" for most domains. Meta-analysis results suggested that DN was more effective than acupuncture in alleviating pain intensity and functional disability at postintervention, while its efficacy on pain and disability at follow-up was only equal to acupuncture. Besides, DN was superior to sham needling for alleviating pain intensity at postintervention/follow-up and functional disability at postintervention. Additionally, qualitative review revealed that DN combined with acupuncture had more significant effect on alleviating pain intensity at postintervention and achieved higher response rate than DN alone. However, compared with other treatments (laser, physical therapy, other combined treatments, etc.), it remained uncertain whether the efficacy of DN was superior or equal because the results of included studies were mixed. Compared with acupuncture and sham needling, DN is more effective for alleviating pain and disability at postintervention in LBP, while its effectiveness on pain and disability at follow-up was equal to acupuncture. Besides, it remains uncertain whether the efficacy of DN is superior to other treatments. Nevertheless, considering the overall ""high"" or ""unclear"" risk of bias of studies, all current evidence is not robust to draw a firm conclusion regarding the efficacy and safety of DN for LBP. Future RCTs with rigorous methodologies are required to confirm our findings. No ethical approval was required for this systematic review and meta-analysis."
29952979," The rare morphological variant of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) may pose a challenge in diagnosis, especially when presentation primarily involves skin lesions. Here we describe a rare case of small cell variant of ALCL in an 11-year-old girl. We performed clinical, morphological, and immunohistochemical analyses of developed cutaneous nodules. Pathologists should consider this small cell variant in ALCL differential diagnosis, as early and correct diagnosis has important clinical implications. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation appears to be a promising treatment option for small cell variant of ALCL. Histological diagnosis of small cell variant of ALCL is challenging among pediatricians because of its low incidence and atypical presentation. We provide a short review of the small cell variant of ALCL to facilitate the diagnosis of this difficult-to-recognize entity."
29952978," To examine whether obesity/overweight is a risk predictor for breast cancer recurrence and death by menopausal status in a retrospective study. We performed a retrospective analysis of 1017 breast cancer patients treated in our hospital from January 2004 to December 2012. Three groups were divided according to body mass index (BMI) when breast cancer diagnosis: normal weight, BMI < 25.0 kg/m; overweight, 25.0≤BMI < 30.0 kg/m; and obesity, BMI≥30.0 kg/m. The clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients within 5 years following breast cancer diagnosed were analyzed. Subgroup analyses of BMI on breast cancer prognosis were analyzed according to the menopausal status when breast cancer diagnosis. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Overweight and obesity groups were associated with larger size tumors, older age, increased proportion of postmenopausal patients and less patients choosing anthracycline and/or taxane regimen. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) decreased in overweight and obese patients (P < .001), and both overweight and obesity were independent predictors for increased risks of breast cancer relapse and death (P < .001). When stratified by menopausal status, both overweight and obesity were associated with reduced 5-year DFS and OS in postmenopausal patients (P < .050), and multivariate analysis showed that the risk of relapse and breast cancer mortality in these 2 groups also increased (P < .050). Among premenopausal patients, the risks of relapse and death were significantly increased in obesity group rather than overweight group by multivariate analysis. Overweight and obesity might be independently associated with poorer prognosis for breast cancer patients, and the effects of overweight on the breast cancer prognosis seem to be related to menopausal status."
29952977," Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) involving non-endocrine organs has been frequently reported, whereas LCH involving endocrine organs is rare and the mechanism is unclear. We report a case of multiple-systemic Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) that first manifested with thyroid goiter, followed by pituitary and liver involvement. The diagnosis was confirmed based on immunohistochemistry of the thyroid and liver. The patient was treated with thyroidectomy combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy for thyroid and liver, respectively. Surprisingly, the patient presented with clinical remission and no new lesion of LCH was found during follow-up over 10 years. LCH involving the endocrine system is unusual and easily misdiagnosed or delayed, especially when the thyroid and pituitary glands are involved. Pathological examination is necessary for a definitive diagnosis. Regular examinations, such as anterior and posterior pituitary hormones, should be especially evaluated annually in the patients with LCH involving endocrine system."
29952976," Several studies have been conducted to explore the prognostic value of miR-183 in different types of cancer; however, their results were controversial. Therefore, the present meta-analysis was conducted to comprehensively evaluate the prognostic value of miR-183 expression level in cancer. A comprehensive literature search was carried out by searching PubMed and EMBASE database between January 1966 and April 2017. Fixed effect and random effect models were used to evaluate the pooled hazard risk (HR) and the relevant 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analysis were also carried out. A total of 12 studies published between 2011 and 2017 were included in the present meta-analysis. The meta-analysis result indicated that there was a significant association between miR-183 expression level and overall survival (HR = 2.642; 95%CI: 2.152-3.245), and there was a significant association between miR-183 expression level and tumor progression (HR = 2.403; 95%CI: 1.267-4.559). In subgroup analysis, we found that high expression level was significantly associated with poor prognosis in most cancers (HR = 2.824, 95%CI: 2.092-3.813); however, low miR-183 level was significantly associated with poor prognosis in melanoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (HR = 2.322, 95%CI: 1.337-4.031). The results of our meta-analysis indicated that the highly expressed miR-183 might predict poor survival of patients with most cancer types, whereas the downregulated miR-183 level might be associated with poor prognosis in patients with melanoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."
29952975," Melioidosis is an emerging infectious disease caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei. To our knowledge, there have been very few cases of splenic abscesses due to melioidosis in Hainan, China. The patient was a 55-year-old male farmer, who was admitted in our hospital with persistent left epigastric dull pain accompanied by chills and febrile. One month before, the patient presented with persistent abdominal pain. After received anti-infection therapy, the subjective symptoms eased slightly, but recently he suffered from intermittent abdominal pain again. Bacteria isolated from splenic pus were identified as B. pseudomallei by the Phoenix-100 system and indirect immunofluorescence. The patient was treated by surgical excision and anti-infection therapy. The patient was then treated with intravenous ceftazidime and oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 2 weeks and his clinical symptoms improved. In endemic areas, B. pseudomallei should be considered as a causative organism of splenic abscess in patients with established risk factors. The isolation of B. pseudomallei from abscess sites is crucial to improve clinical outcomes by appropriate antimicrobial therapy coupled with surgical drainage."
29952974," Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy, which could metastasize at an early stage of the disease and associated with poor prognoses. Liver, small bowel, stomach, and colon are the most common locations for metastatic visceral melanoma, however, solitary abdominal metastasis from uveal melanoma is extremely rare. The current study reports the case of a 33-year-old man with history of treated choroidal melanoma of the left eye that developed metastasis to the abdomen, preoperative endoscopic ultrasonography and computed tomography strongly suggested as a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). The patient was diagnosed with abdominal metastatic melanoma according to his medical history and histopathological results. The young adult underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery. The patient finally got the definite diagnosis with his medical history and histopathological results and he has been living disease free for nearly 3 years after the surgery. Although rare, the possibility of abdominal metastatic melanoma presenting with the clinical picture of gastrointestinal stromal tumor must be always considered by the surgeon especially the patients with a history of primary malignant melanoma."
29952973," Ticagrelor, a new type of P2Y12 receptor antagonist, has been highly recommended to be used in acute coronary syndrome by the latest guideline, but its side effects are not well-known. We seek to illustrate a potential fatal condition, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), caused by ticagrelor. An 87-year-old man who had been prescribed with ticagrelor for 2 months after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), presented with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, renal and liver dysfunction, heart failure and fever. Peripheral blood smear showed schistocytosis, and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 13 (ADAMTS13) activity is low, with normal initial coagulation tests, which were compatible with a diagnosis of TTP. After cessation of ticagrelor and initiation of therapeutic plasma exchange, our patient recovered. Re-administration of ticagrelor aggravated TTP and led the patient to death. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of ticagrelor-induced TTP in patients with a history of recent myocardial infarction; It is of crucial significance to discontinue and never reuse ticagrelor as long as it is suspected to be implicated in TTP."
29952972," Vascular sclerosis mostly occurs in arteries and is mainly related to anatomic structure and hemodynamics of artery. This study aimed to investigate effects of arterial blood on vein wall and explore differences of composition between arterial and venous blood.Ultrasound was used to examine the distal venous structure of arteriovenous fistula in uremia patients. Immunohistochemistry was used to study the pathology of the distal vein. Twelve patients were divided into control group and trial group. Patients received an arteriovenous fistula within 1 month in control group. Patients had undergone this surgery ≥2 years before in the trial group. Blood samples were collected from the aortic, arterial, and venous vessels of 51 patients who had taken coronary angiography and analyzed with blood routine rest, biochemical, and immunological measures to compare the differences of blood composition between artery and vein. This study was registered with the China Clinical Trial Center website under registration number ChiCTR-OOC-16008085.In the trial group, the vascular wall of distal veins of fistula were thickened and hardened. No significant differences of blood composition were found between the aortic and radial arterial blood. However, the differences in the percentages of lymphocytes and neutrophils between arterial and venous blood were significant (Pa = .0095, Pb = .01).Under smooth hemodynamic conditions, arterial blood caused hardening of the venous wall. Arterial and venous blood differed in the percentage of lymphocyte and neutrophils. This may contribute to the vascular sclerosis that is observed in arteries more often than veins."
29952971," Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study.The purpose of this study was to investigate the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for distinguishing between pyogenic spondylitis and brucellar spondylitis.Although pyogenic spondylodiscitis (PS) and brucellar spondylitis (BS) are common causes of spinal infections, the variety of their clinical manifestations complicates differential diagnosis. MRI may be helpful in differential diagnosis and treatment.MRI images of 64 patients who underwent MRI of the spine and with confirmed spondylitis were retrospectively reviewed. After referring to the related medical literature, we compared 32 patients with pyogenic spondylitis and 32 patients with brucellar spondylitis regarding MRI findings. Statistical analysis was performed with the chi-square test. Statistical significance was defined as P < .05.The significant differences between PS and BS on MRI findings are listed as follows (P < .05): diffuse, partial and fan-shaped hyperintense signals on middle sagittal fat-suppressed weighted images (PS: 51, 11, 3/65 vs BS:35, 18, 19/72); focal endplate destruction (PS: 9/43 vs BS:27/35); extensive end plate destruction (PS: 29/43 vs BS:8/35); ballooning change of the intravertebral space (PS: 7/32 vs BS:0/32); an inflammatory reaction line from the end plate (PS: 30/65 vs BS: 1/72); a disc invasion sign (PS: 1/28 vs BS:12/33); an inflammatory reaction line in the disc (PS: 5/28 vs BS:25/33); and 8) severe intravertebral space destruction (PS: 17/28 vs BS:12/33);MRI imaging provides useful information for the differentiation between pyogenic spondylitis and brucellar spondylitis."
29952970," Acute pancreatitis in pregnancy (APIP) is a rare but dangerous complication. APIP has common symptoms with acute abdomen. Assessment of an acute abdomen is more complicated during pregnancy because the gravid uterus could mask most of symptomatic signs. It has been a challenge to diagnose APIP by physical examination or diagnostic imaging. Case studies on APIP are also limited for analysis on the risk factors associated with the disease. This retrospective study evaluated a series of risk factors from a relatively substantial number of APIP cases to determine early predictors or prognosis markers for APIP.Fifty-nine APIP patients together with 179 random normal pregnant women in Shengjing Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University were included for this retrospective study. Medical parameters of blood test in biochemistry and hematology were compared between 2 groups using t test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between various factors and APIP using Statistical Applied Software (SAS student version).Compared with normal pregnant women, APIP patients have elevated values in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, C-reactive protein, direct bilirubin, fibrin degradation products, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), glucose, lipase, pH and decreased values in albumin, fibrinogen, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), hemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-D), and total proteins from their blood tests. In addition, APIP patients have decreased numbers in red cells but increased numbers in white blood cells and increased ratio of neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L). Among these factors, N/LR, GGT, lipase, and HDL are significantly associated with APIP. This study suggests that the combination of those factors serve as a panel of indicators for early-onset prognosis of APIP.GGT, lipase, HDL, and N/LR can serve as a panel of factors to predict APIP. More case studies are important to further evaluate the predicting power of this panel factors in APIP."
29952969," Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is relatively common in patients with liver cirrhosis waiting for liver transplantation (LT). Anticoagulation is an important non-invasive treatment strategy for patients with cirrhosis and PVT. This is the case of a 51-year-old man who presented with cryptogenic liver cirrhosis associated with ascites. Computed tomography (CT) and Doppler ultrasonography (US) showed a partially obstructive thrombus of the portal vein (Yerdel Grade II). Portal vein thrombosis (Yerdel Grade II); liver cirrhosis. The PVT was completely recanalized after 4 months of treatment with the low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) medication enoxaparin but discontinuation of anticoagulants led to PVT recurrence. The patient's condition deteriorated, even though re-treating the anticoagulation with enoxaparin significantly reduced the PVT. The thrombus was removed by a thrombectomy and LT was performed successfully without any vascular complications. Patients with cirrhosis and PVT who are waiting LT can be effectively treated with LMWH anticoagulants. Careful use of anticoagulation is generally safe. Early initiation of anticoagulation treatment may be associated with a high rate of portal vein recanalization."
29952968," The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of computed tomography (CT) vascular reconstruction in the localization diagnosis of perigastric mass. Fifty-eight patients with pathologically detected perigastric mass underwent abdominal dynamic contrast-enhanced CT. CT vascular reconstructions were produced from arterial phase data using volume rendering (VR), multiplanar reconstruction (MPR), and maximal intensity projection (MIP). Image analysis was focused on the relationship between the mass, perigastric arteries, and the gastric wall. Localization diagnosis values were compared between CT vascular reconstruction and dynamic-enhanced CT images. Among the 58 cases of perigastric mass, 41 cases originated from the stomach, 7 cases from the left liver lobe, 6 from the pancreas, 2 from lessor omental bursa, 1 from transverse mesocolon, and 1 from left adrenal gland. The accuracy of CT vascular reconstruction images in the localization diagnosis of perigastric mass was higher than that of dynamic-enhanced CT images (98.3% and 86.2%, respectively, P = .04). On the reference level, 35 (35/41) patients with stomach-originated masses showed the mass adjacent perigastric arteries pushed away from the stomach (arterial displacement sign), and 15 (15/17) patients with nonstomach-originated masses showed perigastric arteries between the mass and the stomach (arterial entrapment sign). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the localization diagnosis of perigastric mass with arterial displacement sign were 85.4%, 100%, 100%, and 73.9%, respectively, and with arterial entrapment sign, 88.2%, 100%, 100%, and 95.3%, respectively. CT vascular reconstruction can clearly depict the relationship between perigastric mass and adjacent perigastric arteries, which may help us more accurately differentiate between stomach-originated and nonstomach-originated masses compared with original dynamic-enhanced CT images."
29952967," Lung microbiota may affect innate immunity and treatment consequence in the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained from 11 OSA patients and 8 patients with other lung diseases as control, and used for lung microbiota profiling by PCR amplification and sequencing of the microbial samples. It was demonstrated that phyla of Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, and Bacteriodetes were relatively abundant in the lung microbiota. Alpha-diversity comparison between OSA and control group revealed that Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria were significantly higher in OSA patients (0.3863 ± 0.0631 and 0.0682 ± 0.0159, respectively) than that in control group (0.119 ± 0.074 and 0.0006 ± 0.0187, respectively, P < .05 for both phyla). In contrast, Firmicutes was significantly less in OSA patients (0.1371 ± 0.0394) compared with that in the control group (0.384 ± 0.046, P < .05). Comparison within a group (ß-diversity) indicated that the top 5 phyla in the OSA lung were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, and Acidobacteria, while the top 5 phyla in the control group were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria. These findings indicated that lung microbiota in OSA is distinct from that of non-OSA patients. Manipulation of the microbiota may be an alternative strategy to augment airway immunity and to reduce susceptibility to airway infection."
29952966," The purpose of our study was to determine accuracy of CT texture analysis (CTTA) for differentiating benign from malignant pulmonary nodules, and well-differentiated from poorly differentiated lung cancers, with histology as the standard of reference.In this IRB-approved study, 175 adult patients (average age 66 ± 12 years; age range 27-89 years, male 82: female 93) who underwent a noncontrast chest CT examination prior to CT-guided biopsy of pulmonary nodules were included. There were 57 benign (24 tumors or tumor-like lesions; 33 inflammatory conditions) and 120 malignant (29 well-differentiated adenocarcinomas, 48 poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, and 43 squamous cell carcinomas) diagnoses on pathology. CTTA was performed on the prebiopsy noncontrast CT images using a commercially available software (TexRAD limited, UK). The CTCA features analyzed included mean HU values, percent positive pixels (PPP), mean value of positive pixels (MPP), standard deviation (SD), normalized SD, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy.The ROC analyses showed that normalized SD [AUC: 0.63, (CI: 0.55-72), P = .003] had moderate accuracy for differentiating between benign and malignant lesions. For differentiating among well-differentiated and poorly differentiated tumors, the ROC analysis showed that except skewness all other parameters were statistically significant The AUC values of other CTTA parameters were: mean (AUC: 0.73-0.76, P = .001- < .0001).CT texture analyses can reliably predict well- and poorly differentiated lung malignancies. However, inflammatory lung lesions with tissue heterogeneity negatively affect the performance of CTTA when it comes to differentiation between benign and malignant pulmonary nodules."
29952965," Lumbar fusion surgery is an established procedure for the treatment of low back pain. Despite the wide set of alternative fusion techniques and existing devices, uniform guidelines are not available yet and common surgical trends are scarcely investigated.The purpose of this UK-based study was to provide a descriptive portrait of current surgeons' practice and implant preferences in lumbar fusion surgery.A UK-based in-person survey was designed for this study and submitted to a group of consultant spinal surgeons (n = 32). Fifteeen queries were addressed based on different aspects of surgeons' practice: lumbar fusion techniques, implant preferences, and bone grafting procedures. Answers were analyzed by means of descriptive statistics.Thirty-two consultant spinal surgeons completed the survey. There was clear consistency on the relevance of a patient-centered management (82.3%), along with a considerable variability of practice on the preferred fusion approach. Fixation surgery was found to be largely adopted (96.0%) and favored over stand-alone cages. With regards to the materials, titanium cages were the most used (54.3%). The geometry of the implants influenced the choice of lumbar cages (81.3%). Specifically, parallel-shape cages were mostly avoided (89.2%) and hyperlordotic cages were preferred at the lower lumbar levels. However, there was no design for lumbar cages which was consistently favored. Autograft bone graft surgeries were the most common (60.0%). Amongst the synthetic options, hydroxyapatite-based bone graft substitutes (76.7%) in injectable paste form (80.8%) were preferred.Current lumbar fusion practice is variable and patient-oriented. Findings from this study highlight the need for large-scale investigative surveys and clinical studies aimed to set specific guidelines for certain pathologies or patient categories."
29952964," Fallopian tube carcinoma is a rare female genital cancer with no specific clinical and surgical features. It is hardly diagnosed on imaging due to non-specific presentation. Laparoscopy has been recommended as the diagnostic procedure for the assessment of suspicious ovarian and adnexal masses. However, it has brought new complications like tumor recurrences at the trocar insertion sites, called port-site metastasis (PSM). A 65-year-old, postmenopausal woman presented to hospital with loss of appetite, Ultrasound showed ill-defined pelvic mass. The patient was diagnosed with fallopian tube carcinoma by a diagnostic laparoscopy. The PSM as a primary complication following diagnostic laparoscopy of fallopian tube carcinoma, which is presumed by positron emission tomography/computed tomography and confirmed by Nodule resection and further pathological assessment. As port-site metastasis was suspected, the patient was advised to undergo umbilical mass resection. the patient has no signs of recurrence was detected 20 months after the last surgery during follow-up. Laparoscopy plays a significant role in the diagnose and treatment of fallopian tubal and ovarian malignancies but has a risk of PSM occurrence. When isolated PSM occurs the management should be local resection."
29952963," Behçet disease (BD) is an inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, ocular lesions, and skin lesions. Complication of amyloidosis in patients with BD is rare. Here, we report a case of BD with immunoglobulin light chain (AL)-amyloidosis manifested as hematochezia. A 61-year-old man developed sudden hematochezia due to bleeding from multiple small colonic ulcers; AL-amyloid deposition was found on immunohistochemical examination of biopsy specimen of colonic ulcer. Systemic investigation revealed cardiac disfunction with cardiomegaly and progressive renal dysfunction, which indicated the presence of systemic AL-amyloidosis. Based on the findings of colonic ulcers with cardiac and renal involvement, a diagnosis of systemic AL-amyloidosis complicated by incomplete BD was established. He was treated with increased dose of oral prednisolone (20 mg/day), colchicine and mesalazine, because he was reluctant to receive aggressive chemotherapy (melphalan and dexamethasone) or autologous stem cell transplantation. Colonic ulcers completely diminished after treatment, however, he died because of severe urinary tract infection and progressive renal failure after one year of gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations. Our case shows that patients with BD may have GI manifestations due not only to entero-BD but also due to GI amyloidosis."
29952962," The relation has not been reported consistently between the PON1 Q192R polymorphism and coronary heart disease (CHD). To clarify the discrepancy, we performed the present meta-analysis to evaluate the association between the PON1 gene Q192R polymorphism and CHD risk in Chinese population. We conducted a comprehensive search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases for all available case-control studies. Two reviewers independently selected studies. Data were analyzed by STATA software package v 12.0. Thirteen studies investigating the association between the PON1 Q192R polymorphism and risk of CHD were selected in this meta-analysis with 4353 cases and 4882 controls. The association between the PON1 Q192R polymorphism and CHD is statistically significant under the recessive genetic model (R/R vs Q/R + Q/Q, odds ratio [OR] = 1.111, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.017-1.214). We observed no statistical association between PON1 Q192R polymorphism and risk of CHD under allele model (R vs Q, OR = 1.087, 95% CI = 0.976-1.209), homozygous model (RR vs QQ, OR = 1.192, 95% CI = 0.949-1.496), and dominant genetic model (Q/R + R/R vs Q/Q, OR = 1.127, 95% CI = 0.938-1.354). This meta-analysis suggests that the PON1 Q192R polymorphism has a weak association with CHD risk in Chinese."
29952961," Currently, 15% of women in fertility age are infertile and the frequency is increasing. Among the various causes of infertility, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has been shown to decrease the frequency of pregnancies compared with normal females. However, dialysis of patients with ESRD increases the likelihood of pregnancy.Herein, we report successful pregnancy and delivery after peritoneal dialysis in a patient who was misdiagnosed as primary infertility. A 37-year-old female who was unaware of her ESRD was misdiagnosed with primary infertility. After undergoing artificial insemination, she was referred to department of internal medicine because of generalized edema, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and poor oral intake. After evaluation, she was diagnosed with ESRD and initiated peritoneal dialysis. The patients was on peritoneal dialysis for a year and discovered that she was pregnant. During pregnancy, the patient maintained a residual urine output, BUN levels below 50 mg/dL, controlled blood pressure and a targeted hemoglobin range. She obtained adequate calories and protein and was managed by a multidisciplinary team. The patient delivered a preterm male baby with no anomalies. ESRD should also be considered among the several causes of infertility in fertile women. If ESRD is the cause of infertility, the frequency of pregnancy increases following dialysis. If pregnancy is diagnosed early, intensive renal replacement therapy, adequate nutritional intake and regular fetal monitoring during pregnancy increase the chances of successful delivery while maintaining PD."
29952960," IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an emerging immune-mediated disease characterized by multi-organ involvement and variable clinical behavior. We describe the case of a 50-year-old woman affected by a rare variant of IgG4-RD, characterized by eyelid xanthelasmas, adult-onset asthma and salivary and lacrimal glands enlargement. Multiple lymphadenopathies and a pulmonary mass were present at initial evaluation. After a single course of rituximab (2g in 2 refracted doses), an almost complete clinical remission was achieved without chronic steroid administration. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the thorax, and positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET-CT) confirmed good response to treatment. Circulating plasmablasts dropped to undetectable levels as well. Xanthelasmas only remained unchanged. Remission persisted at 1-year follow-up. Steroid therapy is still considered standard first-line therapy in IgG4-RD. However, high doses are generally required and relapses are common during the tapering phase. Rituximab is a well described steroid-sparing strategy, so far reserved to refractory cases only. In our experience, rituximab has been used as first-line monotherapy, showing great and sustained efficacy and optimal tolerability. The peculiar variant of IgG4-RD affecting our patient, the relatively low baseline plasmablast concentration, and the early placement of rituximab therapy may have facilitated the good response."
29952959," Increased expression of HOX transcription antisense RNA (HOTAIR) has been reported to be associated with unfavorable prognosis in cancer patients. Several studies have evaluated the significance of HOTAIR in the development and progression of gastrointestinal cancers (GICs). Systematic literature retrieval was performed by searching keywords in several electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, Springer, Google Scholar, and GEO. Relevant articles on association between HOTAIR expression levels and prognosis in patients with GIC were collected and screened with eligible criteria. The RevMan 5.2 software and Stata SE12.0 software was applied. A total of 1297 patients from 15 eligible articles were included in this meta-analysis. The results revealed that increased expression of HOTAIR was significantly associated with shorter overall survival (OS) in GIC patients [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.64-2.26], as well as poorer disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 2.79; 95% CI: 1.38-5.63). Additionally, the pooled odds ratio (OR) indicated that increased HOTAIR was associated with clinicopathological parameters, including lymph node metastasis (OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.71-3.61), distant metastasis (OR = 4.34, 95% CI: 2.12-8.91), poor tumor differentiation (OR = 2.90, 95% CI: 1.45-5.80), lymphovascular invasion (OR = 2.86, 95% CI: 1.83-4.46), high depth of tumor invasion (OR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.36-3.16), and poor clinical stage (OR = 2.72, 95% CI: 1.70-4.35). In survival analysis through the Kaplan-Meier plotter database, enhanced level of HOTAIR was associated with better OS and DFS in gastric cancer patients. High expression level of HOTAIR was related to poor clinical outcome of GIC patients. The HOTAIR could be applied as potential biomarker for assessing the prognosis. Further well-designed studies should be performed to verify the clinical applications of HOTAIR in GIC."
29952958," There is a growing interest in research aimed at better understanding the disease status or predicting the prognosis of patients with simple blood tests associated with systemic inflammation. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and mean platelet volume (MPV) can be used as factors to determine the prognosis of patients in various clinical situations. However, reference values for these attributes based on large, healthy populations have yet to be determined.From January 2014 to December 2016, data from routine blood analyses were collected from healthy patients in the checkup center of a tertiary hospital in Seoul, South Korea. Retrospective data review was then performed on an electronic medical record system. Data were treated anonymously as only age, sex, body mass index, medical history including cancer diagnosis, medications, and smoking status were considered. After the initial screen, we had a collection of 12,160 samples from patients without any medical history, including cancer treatment. This patient pool consisted of 6268 (51.5%, median age 47 years) and 5892 (48.5%, median age 46 years) male and female patients, respectively. The mean NLR across all ages was 1.65 (0.79), and the values for men and women were 1.63 (0.76) and 1.66 (0.82), respectively. The mean LMR, PLR, and MPV were 5.31 (1.68), 132.40 (43.68), and 10.02 (0.79), respectively. This study provides preliminary reference data on LMR, PLR, and MPV from different age and sex groups in South Korea. The results suggest that different cutoff values should be applied to the various patient populations."
29952957," To investigate the relationship of the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and imaging features with the therapeutic efficacy of Phosphorus-32 colloid interstitial radiotherapy in recurrent craniopharyngioma.Thirty-two patients with recurrent craniopharyngioma underwent phosphorus-32 colloid interstitial radiotherapy. The tumor imaging features were classified into 4 types according to the thickness of the cyst wall and signals of the cyst contents as shown by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. Protein expressions of VEGF and VEGFR-2 in craniopharyngioma tissues were evaluated with immunohistochemistry before radiotherapy. The tumor radiosensitivity was determined at 12 months after the interstitial radiotherapy.VEGF mainly expressed in the tumor cytoplasm, and VEGFR-2 expressed either in vascular endothelial cells or in tumor endothelial cells. VEGF/VEGFR-2 expressions varied significantly in cases sensitive or insensitive to the radiotherapy (VEGF: P = .028; VEGFR-2: P = .017). Tumor imaging features were associated with the therapeutic efficacy of interstitial radiotherapy (P = .000). VEGF expression had no association with the imaging features of tumors (P = .226), but VEGFR-2 expression was associated with the imaging features of tumors (P = .008).Our results confirmed the association among imaging features, VEGFR-2 expressions, and tumor radiosensitivity in craniopharyngiomas. Imaging features and VEGFR-2 expressions may add useful data to the radiosensitive assessment of craniopharyngiomas."
29952956," This study aimed to investigate the difference of common adverse events (AEs) between patients experienced first drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE; FD) and second or higher DEB-TACE (SHD), and the factors influencing AEs.Five hundred twenty DEB-TACE records were retrospectively reviewed in this cohort study, among which 284 and 236 records were in FD and SHD groups, respectively. The incidence and/or severity of pain, fever, vomiting, and increased blood pressure (BP) were collected.Pain numerical rating scale (NRS) score, pain severity, body temperature, fever severity, and fever lasting days were higher in FD group than in SHD group, while no difference of vomiting and increased BP between 2 groups were disclosed. Age ≥65 years was associated with decreased high fever and less possibility of vomiting in FD group, and lower pain and fever severity in SHD group; Male decreased the possibility of vomiting in both the groups, and reduced increased BP incidence in SHD group; diabetes history correlated with decreased pain degree and less fever in FD group.In conclusion, SHD was better tolerated compared with FD in liver cancer patients, and older age as well as male were correlated with less occurrence or severity of common AEs in DEB-TACE operation."
29952955," As the prevalence of coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA), it is meaningful that CCTA can provide not only the structural details of artery, but also functional information of vessel elasticity. Our aim was to explore the elasticity characteristics of ascending aorta (AA), descending aorta (DA), main pulmonary artery (MPA), left pulmonary artery (LPA), right pulmonary artery (RPA), and their relationship between each other using 640 slice-volume computed tomography (CT). Furthermore, this study will also observe their relations with age.A total of 42 subjects that were free of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia underwent CCTA on 640 slice-volume CT and were enrolled in this study. The subjects were divided into 2 groups: Group 1, age <46; Group 2, age ≥46. The aortic distensibility (AD) and aortic compliance (AC) of aorta and pulmonary artery (PA) of each group were compared.The AD and AC of PA decreased in the following order: MPA, RPA, and LPA. The correlation coefficients of different elastic parameters between different vessels were found to be different. The correlation coefficient of AD between AA and DA, AA and MPA, DA and MPA, RPA and MPA, LPA and MPA, and RPA and LPA were 0.689 (P = .000), 0.520 (P = .000), 0.393 (P = .010), 0.329 (P = .033), 0.579 (P = .000), and 0.534 (P = .000), respectively. The correlation coefficients of AC for the 6 groups mentioned above were 0.351 (P = .023), 0.470 (P = .002), 0.249 (P = .112), 0.190 (P = .228), 0.441 (P = .005), and 0.409 (P = .010), respectively. There was an age-dependent decrease of AD and AC in AA, DA, MPA, LPA (P < .05), but no difference in RPA (P > .05).The elasticity characteristics of AA, DA, MPA, LPA, and RPA could be well shown by 640 slice-volume CT. The elasticity relativity was observed and was different between AA and DA, AA and MPA, LPA and MPA, LPA and RPA. An obvious age-related decrease in vascular elasticity was found in AA, DA, MPA, and LPA, which should be taken into consideration in clinical trials and treatments for the elasticity-related cardiovascular diseases."
29952954," This retrospective cohort study investigated the outcomes of patients with unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) readmission.All of the patients readmitted to ICU within 48 hours between 2010 and 2016 were enrolled.A total of 99 patients early readmitted to ICU were identified and their mean age of the patients was 68.8 ± 14.8 years. Respiratory failure was the most common cause of ICU readmission (n = 48, 48.5%), followed by acute myocardial ischemia or worsening heart failure (n = 25, 25.3%), sepsis (n = 22, 22.2%), gastrointestinal disease (n = 16, 16.2%), and neurologic disease (n = 11, 11.1%). The median length of stay in the ICU and hospital was 7 (IQR, 4-11.5) and 32 (IQR, 15.5-48.5) days, respectively. A total of 34 patients died during the hospital stay and the rate of in-hospital mortality was 34.3%. Patients with higher APACHE II scores (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02-1.33), underlying malignancy (adjusted OR, 4.70; 95% CI, 1.19-18.57), and cardiovascular organ dysfunction (adjusted OR, 5.14; 95% CI, 1.24-21.38) were more likely to die.The mortality rate of ICU readmission patients was high, especially for those with higher APACHE II score, underlying malignancy and cardiovascular organ dysfunction."
29952953," To evaluate the anticoagulation efficacy of dabigatran etexilate for left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus resolution in patients with atrial fibrillation by transthoracic echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography, and to investigate the anticoagulation factors.A total of 58 atrial fibrillation patients with LAA thrombus in our hospital were enrolled. After dabigatran etexilate anticoagulation for 3 months, the patients were divided into the effective group and ineffective group according to dissolution of thrombosis. The baseline data and the left atrial diameter (LAD), left atrial ejection fraction (LAEF), left ventricular ejection fraction, LAA flow velocity (LAA-v), and LAA thrombus size before and after anticoagulation treatment were recorded, and the measurement index were statistically analyzed.After the patients received anticoagulation treatment for 3 months, 15 patients had complete dissolution, thrombus in 21 patients reduced significantly, and the complete dissolution rate was 25.9% (15/58), the effective rate of dissolution was 62.1% (36/58). Compared with the ineffective group, the proportion of persistent atrial fibrillation and LAD in effective group were lower than those in the ineffective group, the LAEF and LAA-v in the effective group were higher than those in the ineffective group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < .05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis on the baseline data and each ultrasound index showed that the type of atrial fibrillation, LAD, LAEF, and LAA-v were independently associated with the efficacy of anticoagulation (P < .05).Dabigatran etexilate is effective in dissolution of LAA thrombus in patients with atrial fibrillation, and the atrial fibrillation type, LAD, LAEF, and LAA-v are significantly related with the efficacy of anticoagulation."
29952952," To investigate the correlation between echinodermmicro tubule associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-anaplasticlymphomakinase (ALK), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and clinicopathological features in patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma according to International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (IASLC/ATS/ERS) international multidisciplinary classification of lung adenocarcinoma.Ninety patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma underwent surgical pathological classification. Ventana immunohistochemical staining of the EML4-ALK was performed. The mutation of EGFR and EML4-ALK was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the amplification refractory mutation system.The positive rate of EML4-ALK mutation was calculated as 6.7% (6/90), dominantly occurring in patients aged < 60 years. However, it was not correlated with the gender, smoking history, maximal tumor diameter, pleural invasion, lymphatic metastasis, or clinical staging. EML4-ALK fusion gene mutation was mainly associated with the predominant subtypes of acinar and solid tumors with mucin secretion. The mutation rate of EGFR was 60% (27/45). EGFR gene mutation mainly occurred in the female, those with no smoking history and tumor size < 3 cm, whereas it had no association with age, pleural invasion, lymphatic metastasis, or clinical staging. It was histologically characterized with micropapillary, lepidic, and papillary subtypes.The mutation rate of EML4-ALK is relatively high in lung adenocarcinoma patients aged<60 years, pathologically characterized with acinar and solid subtypes with mucin secretion. Female patients with no smoking habit, tumor size<3 cm, pathologically characterized with micropapillary, lepidic, and papillary subtypes had a high mutation rate of EGFR."
29952951," That breast carcinoma is the most common malignant lesion in women. This study aimed to differentiate benign from malignant breast lesions and to predict grading of the latter by comparing the diagnostic value of different parameters in intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI). Retrospective analysis was performed utilizing imaging and pathological data from 112 patients with 124 breast lesions that underwent IVIM-DWI examination with 3.0 T MRI. Out of 124, 47 benign and 77 malignant lesions were confirmed by pathological diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of f, D, and D* value to distinguish benign from malignant breast lesions, was evaluated using pathological results as the gold standard. Correlation between D value and Ki-67 index was evaluated to predict grading of malignant breast lesions. The D value (0.99 ± 0.21) of patients with malignant lesions was significantly lower than that (1.34 ± 0.18) of patients harboring benign lesions (P = .00). The D* value (7.60 ± 2.10) in malignant lesion group was higher than that (6.83 ± 2.13) of the benign lesion group (P = .113). The f value (8.50 ± 2.13) in malignant lesion group was remarkably higher than that (7.68 ± 1.98) of benign lesion group (P = .035). For differential diagnosis of benign from malignant breast lesions, optimal diagnostic threshold of D value and f value were 1.21 and 7.86, respectively. The areas of D and f values under the ROC curve were 0.883 and 0.601, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of D value were 83.0%, 86.7%, and 85.5%, respectively. Accordingly, those indexes of f value were 64.9%, 57.4%, and 62.1%, respectively. Furthermore, the Ki-67 staining index of malignant lesions was robustly negatively correlated with D value (r = -0.395, P < .01). Concrete parameters of IVIM-DWI can help to improve the specificity and accuracy in differential diagnosis of breast benign and malignant lesions. D value is most relevant and valuable in predicting the grading of malignant breast lesions."
29952950," Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can deliver effective respiratory and circulatory maintenance to organ donors, improve organ function, and shorten warm ischemic time before harvesting. However, ECMO-supported brain-dead donors (DBDs) still have a high risk of acute kidney injury related to decreased renal oxygen delivery and inflammatory damage, which may cause early graft failure. Kidney transplantation from an ECMO-supported DBD. We found an extremely abnormal ""very dark blue"" appearance of the graft kidneys from an ECMO-supported DBD during kidney procurement. Rather than discarding the graft kidneys, we performed an on-table biopsy. Pretransplant biopsy results revealed minimal interstitial fibrosis in the section of these graft kidneys. Two candidates received graft kidneys, and the two grafts remained functional until the 8-month follow-up. Currently, there is no standard method for evaluating graft kidney function of ECMO-supported DBDs. Regardless of the donors' preoperative serum creatinine (SCr) level, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), or gross appearance of the graft kidney, we believe that it is more reliable to include pretransplant biopsy as a criterion in clinical practice to safely accept kidneys from ECMO-supported DBDs."
29952949," Sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation (SANT) is a rare case which usually occurs in spleen, but our case occurs in accessory spleen. We reported a case of a 27 year old man who was identified with an isodense mass in the left abdominal cavity by ultrasonicphysical examination without symptoms. Blood routine and tumor markers (alpha fetal protein, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA19-9, CA125) were normal. The tumor was firstly diagnosed as left abdominal mass and its origin was considered as small intestinal by the radiologist. The pathological diagnosis was the sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation (SANT) of the accessory spleen. Laparoscopic splenectomy is a more reliable method for the treatment of SANT. Non-enhanced CT showed iso-intensity lesion of the accessory spleen, and enhanced CT showed progressive enhancement. According to the above characteristics, we should consider the diagnosis of spleen SANT. We reviewed some literatures to summarize the characteristics of SANT."
29952948," Presently, biomechanical support therapy for the femoral head has become an important approach in the treatment of early osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Previous studies have reported that the titanium metal trabecular bone reconstruction systems (TMTBRS) achieved satisfactory clinical results for the treatment of early femoral head necrosis. Electron beam melting technology (EBMT) is an important branch of 3D printing technology, which enables the construction of an interface that is required for support of bone in-growth. However, the effect of TMTBRS created using EBMT for clinical applications for early ONFH is still unknown. At present, there are no reports on this topic worldwide. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety of a new 3D printed TMTBRS implant and to evaluate its clinical efficacy in early ONFH.Thirty patients who underwent surgery for ONFH were selected. The stages of ONFH were classified according to the Association Research Circulation Osseus (ARCO) classification. They were followed-up and radiological examination was performed at 6, 12, and 24 months post-surgery to assess TMTBRS stability and bone growth in the bone trabecular holder portion surface. To evaluate hip function, postoperative Harris and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores were used.The postoperative Harris score increased significantly and VAS score decreased significantly at the 12-month follow-up compared to the 24-month follow-up, wherein the Harris score declined slightly and the VAS score was slightly elevated with the aggravation of ONFH. With the passage of time, postoperative improvement rates were 100% for IIA, 70% for IIB, and 0% for IIC. Hip-preserving rates were 100% for IIA, 100% for IIB, and 50% for IIC.The effect of TMTBRS treatment for early ONFH in ARCO IIA and ARCO IIB is satisfactory. However, it is not recommended for a relatively large area of necrosis such as in ARCO IIC."
29952947," Compassionate care is essential for better clinical and patient outcomes, but during healthcare provision it can be compromised by several factors. This study evaluates factors affecting compassion satisfaction, compassion fatigue and burnout in nursing. Literature search in electronic databases was followed by data extraction, conversion, and meta-analyses under random effect model. Correlation coefficients (r) reported by individual studies were first converted to z-scores for meta-analyses and the overall effect sizes were then back-transformed into r. Eleven studies (4054 respondents; 64.34 [95% confidence interval: 38.82, 89.86] % response rate; age 39.81 [31.36, 48.27] years; 87.11 [79.48, 94.73] % females) were used for meta-analysis. There was a strong positive correlation between compassion fatigue and burnout (r = 0.59), whereas compassion satisfaction had weak negative correlation with compassion fatigue (r = -0.226) but moderate with burnout (r = -0.446). Stress and negative affect were moderately positively associated with compassion fatigue (r = 0.405) but weakly correlated with burnout (r = 0.119). Positive affect and personal/social factors had weak inverse relationship with burnout (r = -0.197). Positive affect also had a moderately positive relationship with compassion satisfaction (r = 0.396). Demographic or professional factors were not significantly related to compassion satisfaction, compassion fatigue, or burnout. In nursing, a variety of stressful factors and negative affect promote compassion fatigue and burnout whereas positive affect is helpful in achieving compassion satisfaction."
29952946," This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulation (PNMES) for treating neck pain in patients with cervical spondylosis (CS). One hundred and twenty four patients with neck pain of CS were included, and then they were randomly divided into a PNMES group and a control group in a ratio of 1:1. All patients received PNMES or sham PNMES 30 minutes daily, 3 times weekly for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was assessed by the visual analog scale (VAS). The secondary outcomes were evaluated by the cervical range of motion (ROM), neck disability index (NDI) score, as well as the adverse events (AEs). All outcome measurements were measured at the end of 12-week treatment, and 4-week follow-up after treatment. At the end of the 12-week treatment, and 4-week follow-up, the patients receiving PNMES exhibited more decrease in the mean VAS (P < .01), and NDI (P < .01) respectively, compared with the patients receiving sham PNMES. Additionally, the increase in the mean ROM was also significantly higher in the PNMES group than that in the sham PNMES group at the end of the 12-week treatment, and 4-week follow-up, respectively (P < .01). No AEs were found in either group. The results of this study demonstrated that PNMES is more effective than Sham PNMES for neck pain relief in patients with CS."
29952945," Jugular bulb anomalies are asymptomatic lesions commonly seen in routine practice. However, some patients with jugular bulb anomalies may present with symptoms such as tinnitus or conductive hearing loss (CHL). A 9 year old boy complained right sided hearing disturbance without any vestibular symptoms. Pure tone audiometry (PTA) revealed a mild right sided conductive hearing loss. Otoscopy showed a red-purplish mass like lesion in his right middle ear cavity, which was regarded as hypervascular tumor. Based on otoscopic findings, preliminary differential diagnoses included jugular bulb anomaly, hemotympanum, cholesterol granuloma and paraganglioma. We performed contrast enhanced computed tomography of the temporal bone (TBCT). CT scan showed and enhancing lesion which was bulging from his right jugular foramen to the middle ear with dehiscent jugular bulb. The lesion showed the same degree of contrast enhancement with the venous vasculature. This lesion contacted with the tympanic membrane, incudostapedial joint and round window, which might be attributable to interruption of sound transmission mechanics. Otherwise there was no evidence of mass or trauma related lesions in the temporal bone. Although most of jugular bulb anomalies are asymptomatic, patients may present with conductive hearing loss due to the interference of sound transmission mechanics."
29952944," It is well known that adrenal insufficiency is common in septic shock or hemodynamically unstable patients. But, there is as yet no sufficient clinically significant data about the exact prevalence or differences in the cause of cirrhosis with adrenal insufficiency. To investigate adrenal insufficiency prevalence in hemodynamically stable patients with cirrhosis and determine differences based on cirrhosis severity or etiology.From July 2011 to December 2012, 69 hemodynamically stable patients with cirrhosis without infection admitted at Hallym University Medical Center were enrolled. Adrenal insufficiency was defined as a peak cortisol level < 18 μg/dL, 30 or 60 minutes after 250 μg Synacthen injection.The study included 55 male patients (79.7%), and the mean age was 57.9 ± 12.9 years. Cirrhosis etiology was alcohol consumption, HBV, HCV, both viral and alcohol related, and cryptogenic in 49, 15, 7, 11, 9 patients, respectively. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 24 patients (34.8%). No differences were found in age, sex, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, HDL, cirrhosis etiology, degree of alcohol consumption, encephalopathy, variceal bleeding history, or hepatocellular carcinoma between patients with or without adrenal insufficiency. Serum albumin level was lower (P < .05), and INR was higher (P < .05) in patients with than in those without adrenal insufficiency. However, multivariate analysis revealed no independent adrenal insufficiency predictor. Significant negative correlations were found between Child-Pugh score and peak cortisol levels (γ=-0.365, P = .008).Adrenal insufficiency was frequent even in hemodynamically stable patients with cirrhosis and tended to be associated with only liver disease severity, being unrelated to cirrhosis etiology."
29952943," The traditional surgical approach for removing a symptomatic urachal remnant is via a lower midline laparotomy and infraumbilical incision or a laparoscopic approach with umbilicoplasty. We reviewed our experience with umbilicus-sparing laparoscopic urachal remnant excision in a single-center study and evaluated its efficacy versus open approach (OA). This study was a retrospective study. Between March 2012 and September 2016, 32 consecutive patients with symptomatic urachal remnants underwent the umbilicus-sparing laparoscopic approach (USLA) (n = 17) or OA (n = 15). The efficacy, recovery, and long-term outcomes were reviewed. Our Results showed that the clinical characteristics of the patients in each group, such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and disease type, had no significant differences (P > .05). No significant difference was found in the surgical procedure times (76.1 ± 15.4 vs 69.2 ± 13.9 minutes, P = .189) and intraoperative blood loss (29.4 ± 13.3 vs 32.2 ± 12.9 mL, P = .543) between the USLA groups and OA groups. However, the mean postoperative hospital stay (patients with bladder cuff excision: 4.1 ± 1.8 vs 6.1 ± 1.4 days, P = .040 and patients without bladder cuff excision: 1.8 ± 0.5 vs 3.6 ± 0.8 days, P < .001) and the time of full recovery (11.2 ± 1.9 vs 15.6 ± 3.1 days, P < .001), the USLA group were both significantly shorter than that of the OA group. No infected recurrence and malignant transformation had occurred at a mean follow-up of 32.4 ± 8.1 and 34.1 ± 8.8 months in USLA group and OA group, respectively. In conclusion, to minimize the morbidity of radical excision, umbilicus-sparing management of benign urachal remnants in adults is a safe and efficacious alternative with superior cosmetic outcomes, postoperative recovery compared with an OA or umbilicoplasty."
29952942," Vitamin D deficiency has become one of the most prevalent health problems in modern society. However, there has been no study that has reported the trend of vitamin D status in Asia. We performed an observational study to investigate the trend of vitamin D status in South Korea based on a representative national database acquired from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES) conducted from 2008 to 2014. A total of 39,759 patients were included in the final analyses. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH)D) levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. The overall mean serum level of 25 (OH)D was 45.7 nmol/L in males and 40.9 nmol/L in females in KNHANES 2008 to 2014. There was a significant trend toward lower serum 25 (OH)D levels from 2008 to 2014 in males by -1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.5 to -0.9) nmol/L per year and in female by -0.7 (95% CI -0.9 to -0.4) nmol/L per year. The overall mean serum level of 25 (OH)D in 2008 was 53.0 nmol/L in males and 45.7 nmol/L in females. It decreased to 43.2 nmol/L in males and 39.2 nmol/L in females in 2014. Vitamin D deficiency, defined as the serum 25 (OH)D level of <50 nmol/L, was found in 65.7% of males and 76.7% of females in overall population. A significant increasing trend of vitamin D deficiency was also observed. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in 2008 was 51.8% in males and 68.2% in females, but rose to 75.2% and 82.5%, respectively, in 2014. The present study demonstrated that vitamin D status in South Koreans is still deteriorating. More extensive and proactive measures are needed to improve vitamin D status in South Korea."
29952941," Although pseudoaneurysm (PA) formation following primary and revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) is rare, PA rupture may lead to severe complications that can result in a threat to life and limb. A 65-year-old man presented with acute hemorrhagic discharge for one day from the chronic hip sinus secondary to revision THA that had been performed 6 years ago, for which he had received multiple courses of debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention procedures owing to periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Radiographs showed septic loosening of both the femoral and acetabular components, with medial migration of the component beyond Kohler's line. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis of the patient demonstrated a large PA of the right external iliac artery (EIA), measuring 6.1 cm × 7.7 cm in diameter and 9.1 cm in length. A ball-shaped antibiotic-loaded cement spacer (ALCS) was used to tamponade a bleeding PA, treat the coexisting PJI, and thus facilitate endovascular stent-graft repair (ESGR) later on. The ESGR resulted in complete exclusion of the PA and successfully controlled the bleeding. The patient underwent a successful revision THA 6 months after stent insertion. Neither stent-graft infection nor recurrent PJI were detected at 18 months. Given the potential of a PA for causing significant morbidity and mortality, the surgeon should have an elevated index of suspicion in the presence of intrapelvic migration of the acetabular component. While facing a PA rupture with/without hemorrhagic shock in patients with coexisting hip PJI, ALCS ball implantation and subsequent ESGR might be an effective method to save the patient's life and limb."
29952940," Among all dermatomyositis (DM) patients, antimelanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 antibody (anti-MDA5 Ab) positive patients have significantly poor short-term mortality, whereas they experience less relapses over the long term after the remission. We report the case of a patient with anti-MDA5 Ab-positive clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM) with the recurrence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) after 7 years of remission. There has been no case report of an anti-MDA5 Ab-positive DM patient with the recurrence of ILD after 7 years of long-term remission. A 70-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed with anti-MDA5 Ab-positive CADM and ILD. After achieving 7 years long-term remission, she was admitted to our department with erythema on the fingers and interstitial pneumonia. Her anti-MDA5 Ab titer was elevated. We diagnosed recurrent CADM complicated with ILD. We successfully treated her with 1,000 mg of methyl-prednisolone pulse and intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy followed by prednisolone 50 mg/day and an increase of cyclosporine. After that treatment, the patient's skin symptoms and interstitial pneumonia were relieved. All laboratory investigations such as ferritin, the serum markers of interstitial pneumonia (i.e., SP-A, SP-D), and the titer of anti-MDA5 Ab showed signs of improvement. Her case suggests that careful physical examinations and monitoring the serum markers are important even after long-term remission is achieved."
