  One of the major concerns in oncology lies in the ability to detect recurrences at their earliest stage to increase the likelihood of cure following second line , or salvage , therapy. Although human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>)- driven oropharyngeal<disease> cancers have a good prognosis , 20-25 % of patients will recur within 5 years of treatment and a significant portion will die from their disease. In recent years , great effort has been put toward evaluating the potential clinical utility of HPV-related biomarkers for early diagnosis of recurrent disease. Indeed , following completion of treatment , detection of HPV-DNA in oral rinses or blood and serologic assays against HPV<pathogen> oncoproteins could be helpful to track residual disease or recurrence. Several recent studies have reported promising findings , thus potentially paving the way for the use of biomarkers in the management of HPV-OPC. In this review , we evaluate and discuss the current knowledge on this topic and provide some directions for future research.
