  Leishmaniasis<disease> is a neglected tropical disease causing opportunistic infection among patients with HIV/AIDS. The fatal form of this disease is visceral leishmaniasis<disease> ( VL). DNA of Leishmania can be detected in saliva , for which the collection is noninvasive and requires little expertise. This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a nested-PCR to amplify the Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 ( ITS1) to detect Leishmania<pathogen> DNA in paired saliva and buffy coat samples of 305 Thai patients with HIV/AIDS in Trang Hospital , Trang Province , southern Thailand. For asymptomatic Leishmania<pathogen> infection among Thai patients with HIV/AIDS , the sensitivity and specificity of the nested-PCR-ITS1 in buffy coat were 73.9 and 100 % , respectively. However , the sensitivity in saliva was 26.1 % and specificity was 100 %. Using the nested-PCR-ITS1 , saliva and buffy coat samples showed positive agreement in only 52.0 % of patients. Saliva tested results with the nested-PCR-ITS1 showed positive agreement with the Direct Agglutination Test ( DAT) in 46.5 % of patients. Only 12.1 % of the samples showed positive agreement for Leishmania<pathogen> infection among all the three tests: saliva , buffy coat and DAT results. Using nucleotide sequencing , at least three species of Leishmania infection were identified in saliva , i.e. , L. siamensis ( n = 28) , L. martiniquensis ( n = 9) , and L. donovani complex ( n = 1). As a result , buffy coat still appears to be a better specimen to diagnose asymptomatic VL infection among individuals with HIV<pathogen>. However , the use of both buffy coat and saliva together as clinical specimens would increase the sensitivity of Leishmania detection.
