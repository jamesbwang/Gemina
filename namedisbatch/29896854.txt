  Lactic acid is a platform chemical for the sustainable production of various materials. To develop a robust yeast platform for low-pH production of d-lactic acid ( LA) , an acid-tolerant yeast strain was isolated from grape skins<disease> and named Pichia<pathogen> kudriavzevii<pathogen> NG7 by ribosomal RNA sequencing. This strain could grow at pH 2.0 and 50 Â°C. For the commercial application of P.<pathogen> kudriavzevii<pathogen> NG7 as a lactic acid producer , the ethanol fermentation pathway was redirected to lactic acid by replacing the pyruvate decarboxylase 1 gene ( PDC1) with the d-lactate dehydrogenase gene ( d-LDH) derived from Lactobacillus<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> To enhance lactic acid tolerance , this engineered strain was adapted to high lactic acid concentrations , and a new transcriptional regulator , PAR1 , responsible for acid tolerance , was identified by whole-genome resequencing. The final engineered strain produced 135 g/L and 154 g/L of d-LA with productivity over 3.66 g/L/hr at pH 3.6 and 4.16 g/L/hr at pH 4.7 , respectively.
