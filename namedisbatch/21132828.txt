  The inclusion of an azaspiroketal Mannich base in the membrane targeting antitubercular 6-methoxy-1- n-octyl-1 H-indole scaffold resulted in analogs with improved selectivity and submicromolar activity against Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> H37Rv<pathogen> The potency enhancing properties of the spiro-fused ring motif was affirmed by SAR and validated in a mouse model of tuberculosis<disease> As expected for membrane inserting agents , the indolyl azaspiroketal Mannich bases perturbed phospholipid vesicles , permeabilized bacterial cells , and induced the mycobacterial cell envelope stress reporter promoter p iniBAC. Surprisingly , their membrane disruptive effects did not appear to be associated with bacterial membrane depolarization. This profile was not uniquely associated with azaspiroketal Mannich bases but was characteristic of indolyl Mannich bases as a class. Whereas resistant mycobacteria could not be isolated for a less potent indolyl Mannich base , the more potent azaspiroketal analog displayed low spontaneous resistance mutation frequency of 10
