  Diagnosis of osteomyelitis<disease> presents a formidable challenge. Lack of pathognomonic clinical sign ( s) and diagnostic tests that can diagnose osteomyelitis<disease> at an early stage contribute to this difficulty. If the diagnosis is not made early , the disease becomes very difficult to eradicate and can lead to limb threatening and potentially life-threatening complications. Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> is the most common organism causing osteomyelitis<disease> Raman Spectroscopy provides information about molecular vibration that could potentially be harnessed as a spectral signature for cellular changes in specific pathologic conditions. In this study we describe a technique using Raman spectroscopy that could potentially be used to diagnose staphylococcal osteomyelitis<disease> Human bone samples were co-cultured with Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>) and the effects of bacterial growth on bone quality were then monitored using Raman spectroscopy. A major drop in the bone mineral quality and crystallinity was observed in the infected bones compared to the controls. S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> infection was also found to alter the collagen cross-linking. Our study shows that specific spectral signatures are present for the cause as well as the effect of staphylococcal osteomyelitis<disease> , opening the possibility of developing a useful diagnostic modality for early and rapid diagnosis of this condition.
