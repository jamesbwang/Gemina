  Dengue<disease> fever<disease> is one of the most prevalent disease in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. According to the World Health Organisation ( WHO) , approximately 3.5 billion people have been affected with dengue<disease> fever<disease>. Four serotypes of dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( DENV<pathogen>) i.e. DENV1 , DENV2 , DENV3 and DENV4 have up to 65 % genetic variations among themselves. dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> 4 ( DENV4) was first reported from Amazonas , Brazil and is spreading perilously due to lack of awareness of preventive measures , as it is the least targeted serotype. In this study , non-structural protein 4B of dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> 4 ( DENV4-NS4B) is computationally characterised and simulations are performed including solvation , energy minimizations and neutralisation for the refinement of predicted model of the protein. The spiropyrazolopyridone is considered as an effective drug against NS4B of DENV2 , therefore , a total of 91 different analogues of spiropyrazolopyridone are used to analyse their inhibitory action against DENV4-NS4B. These compounds are docked at the binding site with various binding affinities , representing their efficacy to block the binding pocket of the protein. Pharmacological and pharmacokinetic assessment performed on these inhibitors shows that these are suitable candidates to be used as a drug against the dengue<disease> fever<disease>. Among all these 91 compounds , Analogue-I and Analogue-II are analysed to be the most effective inhibitor having potential to be used as drugs against
