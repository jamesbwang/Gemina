  Chronic hepatitis<disease> D<disease> is caused by coinfection of hepatitis<disease> B<disease> and hepatitis<disease> D<disease> virus. While HDV<pathogen> is the dominant virus over HBV in the majority of cases , mechanisms and consequences of viral dominance are largely unknown. We aimed to investigate associations between viral dominance patterns and patients ' characteristics and inflammatory features; 109 HDV-infected patients treated with PEG-IFNa-2Î± within the international multicentre , prospective HIDIT-2 trial were studied. Patients were classified as D- or B-dominant if the viral load of one virus exceeded that of the other virus by more than 1log
