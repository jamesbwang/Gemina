  The incidence of skin and soft<disease> tissue<disease> infections<disease> ( SSTIs) , for which HIV<pathogen> is a significant risk factor , in United States emergency departments ( EDs) increased dramatically after 2000 with the emergence of CA-MRSA. Few studies have examined SSTI incidence among U.S. HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected patients after 2010. Data were obtained for patient encounters at all academic medical center EDs affiliated with the Vizient clinical data warehouse who had an SSTI-associated ICD-9 code between January 1 , 2009 and December 31 , 2014. The rate was calculated per 1,000 ED encounters by year and stratified by SSTI , HIV<pathogen> , and both; and by age group , race , payer type , and region of care. Poisson regression was used to assess temporal change over the study period. In 2009-14 , 47,317 HIV-associated and 820,440 SSTI-associated encounters were recorded among 25,239,781 ED patient encounters. The rate of SSTIs among all patients as well as among patients with HIV<pathogen> decreased 8 % and 14.6 % , respectively. The SSTI incidence overall decreased from 32.0 to 29.7/ 1000 ED encounters between 2009 and 2014. HIV-infected patients had a significantly higher rate of SSTIs than HIV-uninfected patients ( ARR = 1.91; 95 % CI: 1.84- 1.99). The decline in SSTI incidence in U.S. EDs between 2009 and 2014 is a remarkable epidemiologic shift from the increase in SSTIs after 2000 , and further research is necessary to assess reasons for the decrease.
