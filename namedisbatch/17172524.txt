  Streptococcus<pathogen> ( S.) suis<pathogen> is an important porcine pathogen causing meningitis<disease> , arthritis<disease> and septicemia<disease> As cps7 emerged recently in Germany in association with severe herd problems , the objective of this study was to characterize the geno- and phenotype of invasive cps7 strains. Twenty cps7 strains were isolated from diseased pigs from different farms with S suis herd problems due to meningitis<disease> and other pathologies. Eighteen of the cps7 isolates belonged to sequence type ( ST) 29. Most of these cps7 strains secreted a short MRP variant in agreement with a premature stop codon. Expression of Ide
