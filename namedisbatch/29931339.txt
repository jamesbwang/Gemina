  Previous work has demonstrated that a surfactant-based dressing was capable of eliminating any evidence of pre-existing biofilms from an ex vivo porcine skin wound<disease> model. Herein , the authors test both the surfactant 's ability to prevent biofilm formation and its ability to eliminate Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> biofilms. To test biofilm formation inhibition , porcine skin explants were inoculated and incubated for 4 hours before treatment. The explants were then dressed with test or control materials. To test biofilm elimination , mature 3-day biofilms were established and then treated and wiped daily. Explants from each group were harvested daily , and total and biofilm-associated bacterial counts were generated up through day 3 posttreatment. The control explants developed a biofilm with ~ 106 CFU over the course of 3 days for each of the bacteria tested. The surfactant-treated samples had viable bacteria , but with the exception of a single time point for Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> without silver sulfadiazine , there was no biofilm formation. Unlike previous results , the surfactants could not eliminate the A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> biofilm , unless it was formulated with relevant antibiotics. The surfactant was effective in preventing the formation of biofilms over a 3-day period. Unlike the authors ' previous results , the daily surfactant-based approach alone did not eliminate the A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> biofilms unless relevant antibiotics were included. The data suggest that the surfactants can prevent biofilm formation , but that in the case of a confirmed A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> biofilm , the surfactant must include antibiotics.
