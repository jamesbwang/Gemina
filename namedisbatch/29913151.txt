  Calcium signaling has an essential role in fundamental processes of Plasmodium life cycle , including migration , cell invasion and parasite development. Two important players in calcium homeostasis , the Histidine Triad ( HIT) protein that is implicated in calcium signaling in mammalian cells and calmodulin , which is a classic calcium sensor in eukaryotes are present in Plasmodium<pathogen> falciparum<pathogen> , however theirs function is unknown in the parasite. Here , we investigated the involvement of the P.<pathogen> falciparum<disease> Histidine Triad protein ( PfHint-1) and calmodulin ( PfCaM) in calcium signaling and intracellular proteolysis. For this , we targeted PfHint-1 with a hemagglutinin tail and overexpressed both proteins. We observed that PfHint-1 is expressed throughout the erythrocytic stages and partially colocalizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. Parasites overexpressing PfHint-1 displayed lower ER Ca
