  The microbiota inhabiting the soil , as well as the rhizosphere , represents a key determinant of several plant functions. Like for humans , dysbiosis of the plant-associated microbiota may be a co-causal agent in disease with still obscure eziology. In the last decades , the common reed Phragmites australis<pathogen> has been deeply studied for its disappearance from natural stands , but no clear causative agents have been identified and no laboratory models of such `` reed die-back syndrome<disease> '' ( RDBS) have been developed. In this study , we try to shed light on the RDBS , by comparing the rhizosphere microbiota of five Italian P. australis<pathogen> populations with different degrees of decline. Results obtained showed a biogeographical meaningful pattern of rhizosphere microbiota , coupled with an impact of RDBS. Obtained data allowed to construct a two-steps predictive model which enabled the prediction of the plant health status from the microbiota taxonomic composition , independently from their geographic location. In conclusion , this study represents one of the first overviews that statistically links RDBS to alteration of rhizosphere microbiota and suggests a model for the analysis of plant-bacteria relationships in nature.
