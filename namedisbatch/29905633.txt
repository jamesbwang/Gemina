  Catheter-associated urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> account for 30 % of healthcare-associated infections. To date , few studies have addressed pediatric catheter-associated urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> in PICUs. The aim of our study was to assess the risk of catheter-associated urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> in relation to the duration of catheterization in the PICU. Retrospective cohort study. PICU at a tertiary children 's hospital. Our study was conducted between April 2012 and June 2015 at Tokyo Metropolitan Children 's Medical Center in Japan. Children in the PICU with an urethral catheter were included. Catheter-associated urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> cases were defined according to the National Healthcare Safety Network criteria. The patients ' demographic data and isolated organisms were reviewed. Duration of catheterization and the catheter-associated urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> occurrence rate were analyzed. None. Among 1,890 catheterizations , 23 catheter-associated urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> cases were identified. The overall occurrence rate was 2.35/ 1,000 catheter-days. Among the patients with catheter-associated urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> , 13 were boys. The median age was 11 months ( interquartile range , 7-35 mo) , and the median duration of catheterization was 7 days ( interquartile range , 5-12 d). The isolated bacteria were Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( 26.5 %) , Enterococcus<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> ( 17.6 %) , and Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> ( 11.8 %). Two species were isolated in each of 11 cases ( 47.8 %). Each additional day of catheterization increased the risk of catheter-associated urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> ( odds ratio , 1.06; 95 % CI , 1.02-1.10 , and odds ratio adjusted for contact precaution status and surgical procedures was 1.05; 95 % CI , 1.01-1.09). Longer duration of catheterization increased the risk of catheter-associated urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> by 5 % each day at the PICU. Prompt removal of the urethral catheter is strongly recommended whenever feasible.
