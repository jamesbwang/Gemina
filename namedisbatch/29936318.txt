  Myanmar is a WHO high tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) burden country with a high multidrug-resistant ( MDR)- TB burden. Significantly a high prevalence of the Beijing genotype of Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> ( MTB) among MDR-MTB has been reported previously. To explore whether an association exists between the prevalence of the Beijing MTB genotype and MDR-TB in Myanmar , we performed detailed genetic characterization of TB clinical isolates. A total of 265 MDR-MTB clinical isolates collected in 2010 and 2012 were subjected to spoligotyping , mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat ( MIRU-VNTR) analysis , SNP typing and drug resistance-associated gene sequencing including rpoC to detect potential compensatory evolution. Of the total MDR-MTB isolates , 79.2 % ( 210/265) were of the Beijing genotype , the majority of which were the `` modern '' subtype. Beijing genotype isolates were differentiated by 15-loci MIRU-VNTR and a high clustering rate ( 53.0 %) was observed in the modern subtype. These MIRU-VNTR patterns were similar to Beijing genotype clones spreading across Russia and Central Asia. High prevalence of katG Ser315Thr , and genetic evidence of XDR and pre-XDR and compensatory mutations in rpoC were observed among clustered isolates. MDR-MTB strains of the Beijing genotype might be spreading in Myanmar and present a major challenge to TB control in this country.
