  Porphyromonas<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> and Tannerella<pathogen> forsythia<pathogen> have been thought to be associated with periodontitis<disease> however comprehensive histopathological localization of bacteria in affected human periodontal tissues is not well documented. In the present study , we examined formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded gingival and subgingival granulation tissues from 71 patients with chronic periodontitis<disease> and 11 patients with aggressive periodontitis<disease> , using immunohistochemistry with novel monoclonal antibodies specific to P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> or T.<pathogen> forsythia<pathogen> , together with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for each bacterial DNA. Immunohistochemisty revealed both bacterial species extracellularly , as aggregates or within bacterial plaque , and intracellularly in stromal inflammatory cells , squamous epithelium , and capillary endothelium of granulation tissue. Combined analysis with the results from polymerase chain reaction suggested that localization and density of T.<pathogen> forsythia<pathogen> is closely associated with those of P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> , and that bacterial density is a factor responsible for the cell-invasiveness and tissue-invasiveness of these periodontal bacteria. Detection of these bacteria in the capillary endothelium in some samples suggested possible bacterial translocation into the systemic circulation from inflamed gingival and subgingival granulation tissues. Immunohistochemistry with the novel antibodies showed high specificity and sensitivity , and can be used to locate these periodontal bacteria in routinely-used formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human tissue sections from systemic locations.
