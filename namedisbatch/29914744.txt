  In the last twenty years , despite high vaccination coverage , epidemics of pertussis<disease> are occurring in both developing and developed countries. Many reasons could explain the pertussis<disease> resurgence: the increasing awareness of the disease , the availability of new diagnostic tests with higher sensitivity , the emergence of new Bordetella<pathogen> pertussis<pathogen> ( B.<pathogen> pertussis<disease>) strains different from those contained in the current vaccines , the asymptomatic transmission of B.<pathogen> pertussis<disease> in adolescents and adults and the shorter duration of protection given by the acellular pertussis<disease> ( aP) vaccine. New preventive strategies have already been implemented , such as booster doses of aP vaccine in adolescents and adults , maternal immunisation during pregnancy and the `` cocooning '' strategy , but more are still needed. Knowing what is new about this old disease is necessary to reduce its incidence and to protect infants too young to be vaccinated , which have the highest risk of complications and death.
