  Prophylactic antiviral therapy is recommended for hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>)- infected patients with malignancies who are undergoing systemic chemotherapy. In the current study , we aimed to develop a risk scoring system to guide the selection of prophylactic antiviral agents. In this retrospective analysis , we included consecutive chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> patients who received antiviral prophylaxis for chemotherapy of solid or hematologic malignancies at three large-volume hospitals in Korea. The primary endpoint was HBV<pathogen> reactivation. The inverse probability treatment weighting method was used to minimize selection bias in terms of antiviral assignments. A total of 419 patients were enrolled: 129 patients received lamivudine ( LAM) , 216 received telbivudine ( LdT) , and 74 received entecavir ( ETV) , respectively. Of these , 36 patients developed on-treatment HBV reactivation ( LAM , 17; LdT , 18; ETV , 1). Multivariate analysis identified three independent predictors for reactivation: hepatitis<disease> B<disease> e-antigen positivity , HBV<pathogen> DNA level , and type of malignancy. Accordingly , a risk scoring system was developed wherein one point was assigned for each of the risk factors. HBV reactivation occurred more frequently in the high-risk group ( score â‰¥ 2) than in the low-risk group ( hazards ratio , 14.17; P < 0.001). ETV exhibited superior prophylactic efficacy over LdT or LAM in the high-risk group , whereas no significant difference was noted in the low-risk group. The prognostic scoring system was useful for risk stratification of chemotherapy-related HBV<pathogen> reactivation. High genetic barrier agents appear to be vital for high-risk patients , whereas cost-effectiveness may be more relevant for low-risk patients.
