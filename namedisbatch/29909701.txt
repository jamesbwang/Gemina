  The prevalence of hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection in Sweden is estimated to 0.5 %. Before 1992 , blood transfusion posed a risk of HCV<pathogen> transmission. The primary aim of this study was to estimate anti-HCV prevalence in Stockholm County among individuals receiving blood transfusions 1965-1991. The secondary aim was to study the effect of age at transfusion on the development of liver disease and treatment outcome. This is a retrospective analysis of individuals found to be anti-HCV tested positive in Stockholm County during a national screening campaign in Sweden 2008-2010. All anti-HCV-positive individuals were also HCV<pathogen> RNA tested. Data on age at transfusion , age at diagnosis , HCV<pathogen> genotype , viral load , fibrosis<disease> score , liver histology and antiviral treatment were recorded. Out of 7473 , 134 ( 1.8 %) tested individuals were anti-HCV positive and 102 were HCV<pathogen> RNA positive resulting in a prevalence of chronic hepatitis<disease> C<disease> ( CHC) of 1.4 %. The rate of advanced liver damage was 18 % ( 10/56). Patients younger than 19 years of age at transfusion were significantly more often started on antiviral treatment compared to adult patients , 65 % vs 29 % p < .001. No significant correlation was found between treatment outcome and gender or age at transfusion. In this study , we found an anti-HCV prevalence of 1.8 % which is considerably higher than the estimated prevalence in the Swedish general population ( 0.5 %) , and patients infected during childhood were more likely to receive antiviral treatment. Additional data on the HCV<pathogen> epidemic in Sweden are needed regarding prevalence and age distribution.
