  Coronavirus<pathogen> tropism is predominantly determined by the interaction between coronavirus<pathogen> spikes and the host receptors. In this regard , coronaviruses have evolved a complicated receptor-recognition system through their spike proteins. Spikes from highly related coronaviruses can recognize distinct receptors , whereas spikes of distant coronaviruses can employ the same cell-surface molecule for entry. Moreover , coronavirus<pathogen> spikes can recognize a broad range of cell-surface molecules in addition to the receptors and thereby can augment coronavirus<pathogen> attachment or entry. The receptor of Middle<pathogen> East<pathogen> respiratory<disease> syndrome<disease> coronavirus<pathogen> ( MERS-CoV) is dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP4). In this study , we identified membrane-associated 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein ( GRP78) as an additional binding target of the MERS-CoV spike. Further analyses indicated that GRP78 could not independently render nonpermissive cells susceptible to MERS-CoV infection but could facilitate MERS-CoV entry into permissive cells by augmenting virus attachment. More importantly , by exploring potential interactions between GRP78 and spikes of other coronaviruses , we discovered that the highly conserved human GRP78 could interact with the spike protein of bat coronavirus<pathogen> HKU9 ( bCoV-HKU9) and facilitate its attachment to the host cell surface. Taken together , our study has identified GRP78 as a host factor that can interact with the spike proteins of two
