  Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> ( M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease>) regions of difference ( RD) encode proteins which are potentially useful as diagnostic reagents for tuberculosis<disease> ( TB). In this study , 75 genes from M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> RD1-RD16 were successfully cloned from which 68 proteins were expressed and purified. Three serum pools from patients with pulmonary TB ( PTB) , extra-pulmonary tuberculosis<disease> ( EPTB) and healthy controls ( HC) were used to preliminarily screen individual RD proteins. The OD
