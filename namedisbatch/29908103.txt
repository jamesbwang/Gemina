  The epidemiology of human<pathogen> respiratory<pathogen> syncytial<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HRSV<pathogen>) infection has not yet been systematically investigated in Africa. This systematic review and meta-analysis are to estimate the prevalence of HRSV<pathogen> infections in people with acute<disease> respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> ( ARTI) in Africa. We searched PubMed , EMBASE , Africa Journal Online , and Global Index Medicus to identify observational studies published from January 1 , 2000 , to August 1 , 2017. We used a random-effects model to estimate the prevalence across studies. Heterogeneity ( I A total of 67 studies ( 154 000 participants) were included. Sixty ( 90 %) , seven ( 10 %) , and no studies had low , moderate , and high risk of bias , respectively. The prevalence of HRSV<pathogen> infection varied widely ( range 0.4 % -60.4 %). The pooled prevalence was 14.6 % ( 95 % CI 13.0-16.4 , I This study suggests a high prevalence of HRSV<pathogen> in people with ARTI in Africa , particularly among children and people with severe clinical form. All innovative strategies to curb the burden should first focus on children which present the highest HRSV-related burden.
