  Bullous pemphigoid ( BP) is a blistering autoimmune disease mainly observed in elderly patients. Several triggers are known for this autoimmune disease and some drugs are known to be a cause of BP. However , there are only few case reports on the induction of BP under adalimumab therapy. Other autoimmune diseases , such as lupus erythematosus , are also known to occur under TNF inhibition. Here , we report on an 81-year-old patient who received adalimumab for ulcerative colitis<disease> and subsequently developed BP. Other causes of BP ( tumors , other drugs , viral or toxoplasma<pathogen> infections) were excluded. We initiated a topical and systemic therapy ( prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day) and stopped the adalimumab injections. The patient 's symptoms resolved quickly and we were able to taper corticosteroid therapy. This rare case highlights the importance to monitor for autoimmune events during TNF inhibition.
