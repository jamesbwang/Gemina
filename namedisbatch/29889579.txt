  Leishmaniasis<disease> is one of the neglected tropical diseases and is highly endemic in many countries. Currently , there is no adequate human vaccine and treatment to control the disease. Areas covered: As a result of the failure of chemotherapy and toxicity , it is necessary to find another approach for the treatment of leishmaniasis<disease> Recently , antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs) , originating from natural resources , have attracted much attention for their use as a new antibiotics for many infectious and noninfectious diseases. Natural AMPs are named interchangeably as host defense peptides. They are naturally active in the innate immune system as a primary defense mechanism in most species all over the world. Several AMPs have been tested in in vitro and in vivo experiments against leishmaniasis<disease> Expert commentary: Most AMPs require proper conformation to be active. Leishmania<pathogen> ( L.) tarentolae as a nonpathogenic strain , is an effective tool not only for vaccine development but also for therapy. Recombinant L. tarentolae expressing selective or combined AMPs is a suggestive approach for leishmaniasis<disease> or any other infectious<disease> disease<disease> treatment.
