  Cryptosporidium parvum<pathogen> is a major cause of diarrhea<disease> among human and calves , resulting in severe health hazards and drastic economic losses , respectively. Although C.<pathogen> parvum<pathogen> infection leads to high morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients and bovine calves , this infection remains a neglected disease. Currently available diagnostic tests for C.<pathogen> parvum<pathogen> are primarily based on detection of oocysts , DNA , or secreted antigens in fecal specimens. Demonstration of specific antibodies with a rapid immunochromatographic test ( ICT) will be advantageous not only in providing a simple , rapid , accurate , and affordable tool but also in surveillance because of the ability to recognize recent and past infections. Herein , we developed two ICTs using the diagnostic antigen CpP23 and immunodominant antigen CpGP15 to detect C. parvum-specific antibodies in cattle sera. Because of unavailability of a reference test for antibody detection , evaluation and validation of our developed ICTs were conducted using reference cattle samples and unknown field cattle sera. Serum samples were simultaneously tested by a previously validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) using the same antigens ( CpGP15 and CpP23). ICTs showed substantial ability to discriminate between positive and negative control cattle sera for both CpGP15 and CpP23. Even against field sera , high sensitivity , specificity , and agreement rates were recorded for ICTs compared with the previously validated ELISA with the same antigens ( CpGP15 = 78.78 % , 100 % , and 85.11 %; CpP23 = 80 % , 100 % , and 80.56 % , respectively). Moreover , a high correlation was observed between the test band intensity of ICTs and optical density of ELISA , particularly in the case of CpP23-specific IgM. To our knowledge , this study represents the first development of ICTs that can detect C. parvum-specific antibodies. Our tests will contribute greatly to C.<pathogen> parvum<pathogen> infection control in cattle by providing a method for on-site diagnosis of early and latent infections.
