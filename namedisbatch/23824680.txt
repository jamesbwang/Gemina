  Highly pathogenic avian influenza<disease> A<pathogen> ( H5N6) virus<pathogen> has been circulating in poultry since 2013 and causes sporadic infections and fatalities in humans. Due to the re-occurrence and continuous evolution of this virus subtype , there is an urgent need to better understand the pathogenicity of the H5N6 virus and to identify effective preventative and therapeutic strategies. We established a mouse model to evaluate the virulence of H5N6 A/Guangzhou/39715/ 2014 ( H5N6/GZ14) , which was isolated from an infected patient. BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with H5N6/GZ14 and monitored for morbidity , mortality , cytokine production , lung injury , viral replication , and viral dissemination to other organs. H5N6/GZ14 is highly pathogenic and can kill 50 % of mice at a very low infectious dose of 5 plaque-forming units ( pfu). Infection with H5N6/GZ14 showed rapid disease progression , viral replication to high titers in the lung , a strongly induced pro-inflammatory cytokine response , and severe lung injury. Moreover , infectious H5N6/GZ14 could be detected in the heart and brain of the infected mice. We also demonstrated that anti-influenza polyclonal antibodies generated by immunizing rhesus macaques could protect mice from lethal infection. Our results provide insights into the pathogenicity of the H5N6 human isolate.
