  Human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) is a potentially oncogenic sexually transmitted infection. As the incidence of oropharyngeal<disease> cancer ( OPC) caused by oral HPV<pathogen> infections is rising , further investigation into the natural history of such infections is needed. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize data on the prevalence , incidence , clearance , and persistence of oral HPV<pathogen> infections in healthy individuals. A systematic review of literature published between January 1995 and August 2017 was conducted using Ovid MEDLINE , PubMed , Embase , and the Cochrane Library. Meta-analysis of prevalence and incidence data was conducted. Clearance and persistence data were extracted. Sixty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis demonstrated an overall prevalence of 7.7 % for all types of HPV<pathogen> and 1.4 % for high-risk HPV16. The overall incidence was 4.38 cases per 1000 person-months for all HPV<pathogen> types and 0.92 cases per 1000 person-months for HPV16. This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that oral HPV<pathogen> infection has a lower prevalence and incidence than cervicogenital HPV<pathogen> infection in healthy individuals. Nonetheless , oral HPV<pathogen> is still an important concern , given its oncogenicity and the rising incidence of oropharyngeal<disease> cancer. Consistency of methodology will allow for better future comparisons , particularly of infection clearance and persistence.
