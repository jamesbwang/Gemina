  Malaria<disease> continues to be one of mankind 's most devastating diseases despite the many and varied efforts to combat it. Indispensable for malaria<disease> elimination and eventual eradication is the development of effective vaccines. Controlled human malaria<disease> infection ( CHMI) is an invaluable tool for vaccine efficacy assessment and investigation of early immunological and molecular responses against Plasmodium<pathogen> falciparum<pathogen> infection. Here , we investigated gene expression changes following CHMI using RNA-Seq. Peripheral blood samples were collected in Bagamoyo , Tanzania , from ten adults who were injected intradermally ( ID) with 2.5 x104 aseptic , purified , cryopreserved P.<pathogen> falciparum<disease> sporozoites ( Sanaria Â® PfSPZ Challenge). A total of 2,758 genes were identified as differentially expressed following CHMI. Transcriptional changes were most pronounced on day 5 after inoculation , during the clinically silent liver phase. A secondary analysis , grouping the volunteers according to their prepatent period duration , identified 265 genes whose expression levels were linked to time of blood stage parasitemia detection. Gene modules associated with these 265 genes were linked to regulation of transcription , cell cycle , phosphatidylinositol signaling and erythrocyte development. Our study showed that in malaria<disease> pre-exposed volunteers , parasite prepatent period in each individual is linked to magnitude and timing of early gene expression changes after ID CHMI.
