  There is an urgent need for a more effective vaccine against tuberculosis<disease> ( TB). Cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs) play a critical role in combating Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> ( M.tb). The identiÔ¨Åcation of novel CTL epitopes is essential for the design of peptide-based vaccines. In this study , we predicted CTL epitope peptides of M.tb antigen Rv2629 restricted by HLA-A2 , using bioinformatics methods. The affinity and stability of binding of these peptides with HLA-A2 molecules were detected by flow cytometry. Their ability to induce CTLs generation was determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) from healthy uninfected subjects , Latent tuberculosis<disease> infection ( LTBI) subjects , and TB patients ex vivo. The cytotoxic activity induced by the epitope peptides was tested by lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) release assay. Finally , we found four novel CTL epitope peptides , Rv2629-p190-2 L , Rv2629-p190-1Y2 L , Rv2629-p274 , and Rv2629-p315 , which had high-affinity and stability of binding with T2 cells. Their ability of inducing CTLs was highest in PBMCs from TB patients ( P < 0.05). In addition , these peptides could induce the CTLs to generate specific cytotoxic activity. They showed higher immunogenicity in TB patients and had the potential to become candidate vaccines for TB therapy.
