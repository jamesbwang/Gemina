  Bovine viral diarrhoea<disease> virus ( BVDV) is a cattle pathogen that has previously been reported to be present in bovine raw materials used in the manufacture of biological products for human use. Seven lots of trivalent measles<pathogen> , mumps<disease> and rubella<pathogen> ( MMR) vaccine and 1 lot of measles<pathogen> vaccine from the same manufacturer , together with 17 lots of foetal bovine serum ( FBS) from different vendors , 4 lots of horse serum , 2 lots of bovine trypsin and 5 lots of porcine trypsin were analysed for BVDV using recently developed techniques , including PCR assays for BVDV detection , a qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence-based virus replication assays , and deep sequencing to identify and genotype BVDV genomes. All FBS lots and one lot of bovine-derived trypsin were PCR-positive for the presence of BVDV genome; in contrast all vaccine lots and the other samples were negative. qRT-PCR based virus replication assay and immunofluorescence-based infection assay detected no infectious BVDV in the PCR-positive samples. Complete BVDV genomes were generated from FBS samples by deep sequencing , and all were BVDV type 1. These data confirmed that BVDV nucleic acid may be present in bovine-derived raw materials , but no infectious virus or genomic RNA was detected in the final vaccine products.
