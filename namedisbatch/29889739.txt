  The aim of this study was to analyze chest wall reconstruction following oncologic resection performed by a single surgeon over a 19-year period. A retrospective review was performed for 135 patients who underwent oncologic chest wall resection from 1997 to 2015. Average patient age was 57.8 years. Indications for resection were advanced breast cancer ( n = 44) , soft-tissue sarcoma<disease> ( n = 38) , bone sarcoma<disease> or chondrosarcoma ( n = 28) , desmoid tumor ( n = 11) , metastasis from other cancers ( n = 7) , and other primary tumors ( n = 7). There were 72 full-thickness and 63 partial-thickness resections ( 34 soft-tissue resections only and 29 skeletal bone resections only). Resection margins were wide ( n = 29) , marginal ( n = 82) , and intralesional ( n = 24). Reconstruction was warranted in 118 cases: chest wall stabilization and flap coverage in 57 , chest wall stabilization only in 36 , and soft-tissue flap coverage only in 25 cases. In total , 82 flaps were performed ( 17 free flaps and 65 pedicled/local flaps). There were no perioperative mortalities or flap losses. Complications occurred in 29 operations ( Clavien-Dindo classifications grade II , n = 12; grade IIIa , n = 4; grade IIIb<pathogen> , n = 10; and grade IVa , n = 3) and 19 reoperations were necessary. Median follow-up was 49 months. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. One- , 2- , and 5-year survival rates were 84 , 82 , and 70 percent , respectively. With careful patient selection , appropriate perioperative and postoperative care , and accurate surgical technique , even extensive chest wall resections and reconstructions are safe.
