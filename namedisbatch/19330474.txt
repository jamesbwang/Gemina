  Typhus<disease> group rickettsiosis<disease> is caused by the vectorborne bacteria Rickettsia<pathogen> typhi<pathogen> and R.<pathogen> prowazekii<pathogen>. R.<pathogen> typhi<disease> , which causes murine typhus<disease> , the less severe endemic form of typhus<disease> , is transmitted by fleas; R.<pathogen> prowazekii<pathogen> , which causes the severe epidemic form of typhus<disease> , is transmitted by body lice. To examine the immunology of human<disease> infection<disease> with typhus<disease> group rickettsiae<disease> , we retrospectively reviewed clinical signs and symptoms , laboratory changes , and travel destinations of 28 patients who had typhus<disease> group rickettsiosis<disease> diagnosed by the German Reference Center for Tropical Pathogens , Hamburg , Germany , during 2010-2017. Immunofluorescence assays of follow-up serum samples indicated simultaneous seroconversion of IgM , IgA , and IgG or concurrence in the first serum sample. Cytokine levels peaked during the second week of infection , coinciding with organ dysfunction and seroconversion. For 3 patients , R.<pathogen> typhi<disease> was detected by species-specific nested quantitative PCR. For all 28 patients , R.<pathogen> typhi<disease> was the most likely causative pathogen.
