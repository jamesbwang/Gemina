  Hybridization of natural products has high potential to further improve their activities and may produce synergistic effects between linked pharmacophores. Here we report synthesis of nine new hybrids of natural products egonol , homoegonol , thymoquinone and artemisinin and evaluation of their activities against P.<pathogen> falciparum<disease> 3D7 parasites , human cytomegalovirus , sensitive and multidrug-resistant human leukemia<disease> cells. Most of the new hybrids exceed their parent compounds in antimalarial , antiviral and antileukemia activities and in some cases show higher in vitro efficacy than clinically used reference drugs chloroquine , ganciclovir and doxorubicin. Combined , our findings stress the high potency of these hybrids and encourages further use of the hybridization concept in applied pharmacological research.
