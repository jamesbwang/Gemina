  Japanese<disease> encephalitis<disease> is a neuropathological disorder caused by Japanese<pathogen> encephalitis<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( JEV<pathogen>) , which is characterized by severe pathological neuroinflammation and damage to the blood-brain barrier ( BBB). Inflammatory cytokines/chemokines can regulate the expression of tight junction ( TJ) proteins and are believed to be a leading cause of BBB disruption , but the specific mechanisms remain unclear. IP-10 is the most abundant chemokine produced in the early stage of JEV<pathogen> infection , but its role in BBB disruption is unknown. The administration of IP-10-neutralizing antibody ameliorated the decrease in TJ proteins and restored BBB integrity in JEV-infected mice.
