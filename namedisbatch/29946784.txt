  Various bacteria are associated with ectomycorrhizal roots , which are symbiotic complexes formed between plant roots and fungi<pathogen> Among these associated bacteria , actinomycetes have received attention for their ubiquity and diverse roles in forest<disease> ecosystems. Here , to examine the association of actinomycetes with ectomycorrhizal root tips , we compared the bacterial and actinomycete communities on the surface and inside of root tips of coastal Japanese black pine ( Pinus thunbergii) colonized by the fungus Cenococcum geophilum. Next-generation sequences of 16S rDNA of bacteria communities using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine showed that the number of bacterial classes in the surface of C. geophilum ECM roots was significantly higher than that in non-ECM roots. The bacterial community structure of surface , inside , and non-ECM roots was significantly discriminated each other. For an isolation method , a total of 762 and 335 actinomycete isolates were obtained from the surface and inside of the roots , respectively. In addition , the isolation ratio of actinomycetes in these root tips varied depending on the age of the tree and the season. Identification of the isolates based on partial 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that the isolates belonged to nine genera of the order Actinomycetales. On the surface of the roots , most of the isolates belonged to genus Streptomyces<pathogen> ( 90.4 %); inside of the roots , most of the isolates belonged to genus Actinoallomurus ( 40.0 %) , which is a relatively new taxon. Our results suggest that actinomycetes as well as bacteria are ubiquitously associated with C. geophilum ectomycorrhizal roots of P. thunbergii , although their communities can vary either surface or inside of individual root tips.
