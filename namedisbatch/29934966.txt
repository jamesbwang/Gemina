  Borrelia<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> is the causative agent of Lyme<disease> disease<disease> that persists in a complex enzootic life cycle , involving Ixodes<pathogen> ticks and vertebrate hosts. The microbe invades ticks and vertebrate hosts in spite of active immune surveillance and potent microbicidal responses , and establishes long-term infection utilising mechanisms that are yet to be unravelled. The pathogen can cause multi-system disorders when transmitted to susceptible mammalian hosts , including in humans. In the past decades , several studies identified a limited number of B.<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> gene-products critical for pathogen persistence , transmission between the vectors and the host , and host-pathogen interactions. This review will focus on the interactions between B.<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> proteins , as well as between microbial proteins and host components , protein and non-protein components , highlighting their roles in pathogen persistence in the mammalian host. A better understanding of the contributions of protein interactions in the microbial virulence and persistence of B.<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> would support development of novel therapeutics against the infection.
