  Anopheles<pathogen> gambiae<pathogen> s.l. ( Diptera: Culicidae) is responsible for the transmission of the devastating Plasmodium<pathogen> falciparum<pathogen> ( Haemosporida: Plasmodiidae) strain of malaria<disease> in Africa. This study investigated the relationship between climate and environmental conditions and An. gambiae<pathogen> s.l. larvae abundance and modelled the larval distribution of this species in Baringo County , Kenya. Mosquito larvae were collected using a 350-mL dipper and a pipette once per month from December 2015 to December 2016. A random forest<disease> algorithm was used to generate vegetation cover classes. A negative binomial regression was used to model the association between remotely sensed climate ( rainfall and temperature) and environmental ( vegetation cover , vegetation health , topographic wetness and slope) factors and An. gambiae<pathogen> s.l. for December 2015. Anopheles<pathogen> gambiae<pathogen> s.l. was significantly more frequent in the riverine zone ( P < 0.05 , r = 0.59) compared with the lowland zone. Rainfall ( b = 6.22 , P < 0.001) , slope ( b =- 4.81 , P = 0.012) and vegetation health ( b =- 5.60 , P = 0.038) significantly influenced the distribution of An. gambiae<pathogen> s.l. larvae. High An. gambiae<pathogen> s.l. abundance was associated with cropland and wetland environments. Effective malaria<disease> control will require zone-specific interventions such as a focused dry season vector control strategy in the riverine zone.
