  Larval therapy ( LT) comprises the application of sterile Calliphoridae larvae for wound<disease> debridement , disinfection , and healing in humans and animals. Larval digestion plays a key role in LT , where the salivary glands and gut produce and secrete proteolytic and antimicrobial substances. The objective of this work was to bioprospect the salivary glands of Chrysomya megacephala ( Fabricius , 1794) larvae<pathogen> , using ultrastructural , morphological , and histological observations , and the total protein electrophoretic profile. The salivary glands present a deferent duct , originating from the buccal cavity , which bifurcates into efferent ducts that insert through a slight dilatation to a pair of tubular-shaped tissues , united in the region of fat cells. Histologically , the secretion had protein characteristics. Cell cytoplasm presented numerous free ribosomes , autophagic vacuoles , spherical and elongated mitochondria , atypical Golgi complexes , and dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum. In the apical cytoplasm , secretory granules and microvilli secretions demonstrated intense protein synthesis , basal cytoplasm with trachea insertions , and numerous mitochondria. The present work described the ultrastructure and morphology of C. megacephala third instar salivary glands , confirming intense protein synthesis and the molecular weight of soluble proteins.
