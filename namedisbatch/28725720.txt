  Muscle strength is a functional measure of quality of life in humans. Declines in muscle strength are manifested in diseases as well as during inactivity , aging , and space travel. With conserved muscle biology , the simple genetic model C. elegans<pathogen> is a high throughput platform in which to identify molecular mechanisms causing muscle strength loss and to develop interventions based on diet , exercise , and drugs. In the clinic , standardized strength measures are essential to quantitate changes in patients; however , analogous standards have not been recapitulated in the C. elegans<pathogen> model since force generation fluctuates based on animal behavior and locomotion. Here , we report a microfluidics-based system for strength measurement that we call ` NemaFlex ' , based on pillar deflection as the nematode crawls through a forest<disease> of pillars. We have optimized the micropillar forest<disease> design and identified robust measurement conditions that yield a measure of strength that is independent of behavior and gait. Validation studies using a muscle contracting agent and mutants confirm that NemaFlex can reliably score muscular strength in C. elegans<pathogen>. Additionally , we report a scaling factor to account for animal size that is consistent with a biomechanics model and enables comparative strength studies of mutants. Taken together , our findings anchor NemaFlex for applications in genetic and drug screens , for defining molecular and cellular circuits of neuromuscular function , and for dissection of degenerative processes in disuse , aging , and disease.
