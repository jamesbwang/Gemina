  This case highlights the successful utilization of a multidisciplinary approach to numerous bilateral bronchopleural fistulae<disease> ( BPF) using minimally invasive techniques. In this study , we present a previously healthy 14-year-old male hospitalized with 2009 H1N1<pathogen> influenza<disease> and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> coinfection complicated by severe<disease> acute<disease> respiratory distress syndrome<disease> and multifocal necrotizing pneumonia<disease> , with significant lung tissue damage requiring prolonged extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO) support. The development of multiple BPFs precluded lung recruitment necessary to wean from ECMO. Treatment options were very limited and endobronchial valves were considered. However , localizing single airleaks with a fogarty balloon is normally the technique to determine appropriate location to place the valves. With multiple fistulae<disease> , this technique would be ineffective. Therefore , the patient was brought to interventional radiology and bronchography was performed for selective fistula<disease> mapping. With this precise localization , the multiple fistulae<disease> were ultimately controlled using image-guided embolization and the placement of multiple endobronchial valves. The success of this intervention enabled positive pressure ventilator support and rehabilitation required for weaning from ECMO support. This case highlights the successful utilization of a multidisciplinary approach to numerous bilateral BPFs using minimally invasive techniques.
