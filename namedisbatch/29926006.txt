  We investigated whether a small amount of blood collected by fingertip blood sampling would be adequate in a mass examination for hepatitis<disease> virus<pathogen> infection in Japan. A cross-sectional survey was conducted at health fairs in Kasaoka City and Shodoshima Island , where participants took the hepatitis<disease> screening test. A total of 114 consecutive individuals who took the hepatitis<disease> screening test were enrolled. Twenty microliters of plasma was successfully obtained from all participants. Among the participants , two had positive results for HBs antigen and two were positive for anti-HCV; all four were > 60 years old and rarely visited the hospital. Thirty-three and 38 patients chronically infected with HBV and HCV<pathogen> , respectively , were examined for confirmatory assays at participating hospitals. All subjects with undetectable serum levels of HBs antigen and anti-HCV had undetectable levels of both markers in fingertip blood , and the levels in serum and fingertip blood were significantly correlated ( p < 0.01). The lower detection limit of HBs antigen was defined as 0.005 IU/ml , and the cut-off value of anti-HCV was 1.0 by using 10-Î¼l fingertip blood samples. The fingertip blood sampling described herein may be adequate in mass examinations for hepatitis<disease> virus<pathogen> testing in Japan.
