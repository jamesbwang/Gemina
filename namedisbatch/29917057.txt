  Population-level disease risk across a set of non-overlapping areal units varies in space and time , and a large research literature has developed methodology for identifying clusters of areal units exhibiting elevated risks. However , almost no research has extended the clustering paradigm to identify groups of areal units exhibiting similar temporal disease trends. We present a novel Bayesian hierarchical mixture model for achieving this goal , with inference based on a Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo ( ( MC) $ ^ 3 $) algorithm. The effectiveness of the ( MC) $ ^ 3 $ algorithm compared to a standard Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation is demonstrated in a simulation study , and the methodology is motivated by two important case studies in the United Kingdom. The first concerns the impact on measles<pathogen> susceptibility of the discredited paper linking the measles<pathogen> , mumps<disease> , and rubella<pathogen> vaccination to an increased risk of Autism and investigates whether all areas in the Scotland were equally affected. The second concerns respiratory hospitalizations and investigates over a 10 year period which parts of Glasgow have shown increased , decreased , and no change in risk.
