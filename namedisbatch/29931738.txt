  Rodents serve as the natural reservoir and vector for a variety of pathogens , some of which are responsible for severe and life-threatening disease in humans. Despite the significant impact in humans many of these viruses , including Old and New World hantaviruses<disease> as well as Arenaviruses , most have no specific vaccine or therapeutic to treat or prevent human<disease> infection<disease>. The recent success of wildlife vaccines to mitigate rabies<pathogen> in animal populations offers interesting insight into the use of similar strategies for other zoonotic agents of human<disease> disease<disease>. In this review , we discuss the notion of using baited vaccines as a means to interrupt the transmission of viral pathogens between rodent reservoirs and to susceptible human hosts.
