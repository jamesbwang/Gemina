  Patient registry is a powerful tool for planning health care and setting groundwork for research. This survey reports a detailed registry of inherited bleeding disorders ( IBD) and their management at a not-for-profit organization in a developing country to form the basis for planning development and research. We reviewed medical records of patients with IBD from 8 hemophilia treatment centers of Fatimid Foundation located in various cities. Information collected included sociodemographic data , diagnostic tests , severity of hemophilia A and B , number of bleeding episodes per year , site and frequency of hemarthrosis , and seropositivity for viral<disease> diseases<disease>. We analyzed 1497 patients from November 1 , 2015 , to April 30 , 2016. There were 1296 ( 87 %) males and 201 ( 13 %) females with a mean age of 24.5 ( 11) years ( range , 6 months to 65 years). Hemophilia A constituted the bulk of IBD ( 848 , 57 %) followed by von Willebrand disease ( 172 , 11 %) , hemophilia B ( 144 , 10 %) , platelet function defect ( 106 , 7 %) , and rare bleeding disorders ( 70 , 5 %). Mucocutaneous bleeding ( 1144 , 76 %) and hemarthrosis ( 1035 patients , 69 %) were the main complications. There were 1026 ( 69 %) patients who received only blood components for treatment of any bleeding episode while the remaining 464 ( 31 %) were on combination therapy ( blood components and factor concentrate). Seroreactivity for hepatitis<disease> C<disease> was frequent ( 28 %) , while hepatitis<disease> B<disease> ( 1 %) and human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( 0.01 %) were less commonly seen. This study was an important step toward a patient registry in a hemophilia treatment center in Pakistan. Hemophilia A is the most common bleeding disorder and hepatitis<disease> C<disease> is the most frequent treatment-related complication.
