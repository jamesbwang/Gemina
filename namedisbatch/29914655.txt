  The Campylobacter<pathogen> genus is a large and diverse group of Gram-negative bacteria that are known to colonize humans and other mammals , birds , reptiles , and shellfish. While it is now recognized that several emerging Campylobacter<pathogen> species can be associated with human<disease> disease<disease> , two species , C.<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen> and C.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , are responsible for the vast majority of bacterial gastroenteritis<disease> in humans worldwide. Infection with C.<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen> , in particular , has also been associated with a number of extragastrointestinal manifestations and autoimmune conditions , most notably Guillain-Barr√© syndrome<disease>. The antimicrobial drugs of choice for the treatment of severe Campylobacter<pathogen> infection include macrolides , such as erythromycin , clarithromycin , or azithromycin. Fluoroquinolones<disease> , such as ciprofloxacin , are also commonly used for empirical treatment of undiagnosed diarrheal disease. However , resistance to these and other classes of antimicrobial drugs is increasing and is a major public health problem. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that over 300,000 infections per year are caused by drug-resistant Campylobacter<pathogen>. In this chapter , we discuss the taxonomy of the Campylobacter<pathogen> genus , the clinical and global epidemiological aspects of Campylobacter<pathogen> infection , with an emphasis on C.<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen> and C.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , and issues related to the treatment of infection and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. We further discuss the use of next-generation sequencing for the detection and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance genes.
