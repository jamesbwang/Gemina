  The authors describe a surface-enhanced Raman scattering ( SERS) based aptasensor for Salmonella<disease> typhimurium<pathogen> ( S.<pathogen> typhimurium<pathogen>). Gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs; 35 nm i.d.) were functionalized with the aptamer ( ssDNA<pathogen> 1) and used as the capture probe , while smaller ( 15 nm) AuNPs were modified with a Cy3-labeled complementary sequence ( ssDNA<pathogen> 2) and used as the signalling probe. The asymmetric gold nanodimers ( AuNDs) were assemblied with the Raman signal probe and the capture probe via hybridization of the complementary ssDNAs. The gap between two nanoparticles is a `` hot spot '' in which the Raman reporter Cy3 is localized. It experiences a strong enhancement of the electromagnetic field around the particle. After addition of S.<pathogen> typhimurium<pathogen> , it will be bound by the aptamer which therefore is partially dehybridized from its complementary sequence. Hence , Raman intensity drops. Under the optimal experimental conditions , the SERS signal at 1203 cm
