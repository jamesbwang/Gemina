  In this study , a novel caspase-6 named HLcaspase-6 was identified from sea cucumber Holothuria leucospilota. The full-length cDNA of HLcaspase-6 is 2195 bp in size , containing a 126 bp 5 '- untranslated region ( UTR) , a 1043 bp 3 '- UTR and a 1026 bp open reading frame ( ORF<pathogen>) encoding a protein of 341 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 38.57 kDa. HLcaspase-6 contains the common signatures of the caspase family , including the conserved pentapeptide motif QACRG , as well as the P20 and P10 domains. In addition , HLcaspase-6 contains a short pro-domain. HLcaspase-6 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined , with the highest transcript level in the intestine , followed by coelomocytes. In in vitro experiments , the expression of HLcaspase-6 mRNA in coelomocytes was significantly up-regulated by lipopolysaccharides ( LPS) or polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid ( poly ( I: C)) challenge , suggesting that HLcaspase-6 might play important roles in the innate immune defense of sea cucumber against bacterial and viral<disease> infections<disease>. Moreover , we further confirmed that overexpression of HLcaspase-6 could induce apoptosis and activate the p53 signal pathway.
