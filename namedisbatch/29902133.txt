  The introduction of vaccination programs against measles<pathogen> , mumps<disease> , and rubella<pathogen> ( MMR) led to significant global reduction in morbidity and mortality from these diseases. The currently recommended MMR vaccination schedule in the United States of America comprises 2 vaccine doses typically administered at 12-15 months and 4-6 years , respectively. Considering recent outbreaks in the USA , catch-up vaccination with an additional dose of MMR vaccine could contribute to outbreak control and community protection. This phase III , observer-blind , randomized controlled trial ( NCT02058563) assessed the immunogenicity and safety of a dose of the MMR-RIT vaccine ( Priorix , GSK) compared to MMR II vaccine ( control; M-M-R II , Merck & Co Inc.) in ≥ 7-year-olds who had received ≥ 1 previous dose of MMR vaccine. We assessed anti-measles , anti-mumps , and anti-rubella antibody geometric mean concentrations ( GMCs; primary endpoint) and seroresponse rates ( SRRs) at day 42 post-vaccination. Solicited , unsolicited , and serious adverse events ( AEs) were recorded. The according-to-protocol cohort for immunogenicity included 869 participants ( MMR-RIT: N = 433; MMR II: N = 436). We observed anti-measles , anti-mumps , and anti-rubella antibody GMCs of 1790.2 mIU/mL , 113.5 EU/mL , and 76.1 IU/mL , respectively , and SRRs of 98.8 % , 98.4 % , and 99.5 % , respectively , after a dose of MMR-RIT; non-inferiority compared to MMR II was demonstrated. Both vaccines showed comparable reactogenicity profiles; the most common solicited AEs were injection site redness and pain , and fever<disease> ( MMR-RIT: 12.2 % , 11.8 % , and 3.0 %; MMR II: 11.7 % , 11.5 % , and 5.2 % , respectively). The dose of MMR-RIT induced robust immune responses that were not inferior to those of MMR II , and was well tolerated.
