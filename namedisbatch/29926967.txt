  Trifluoromethyl-substituted quinolones and their analogues have emerged as an interesting platform in the last 6 years to design antiparasite agents. Many of their derivatives have been demonstrated to display excellent efficacy against flagellate parasites such as Plasmodium<pathogen> spp.. In order to identify new analogues of trifluoromethyl-substituted quinolones to treat the American cutaneous leishmaniasis<disease> , we evaluated the antiproliferative activity of a series of 2- ( trifluoromethyl) benzo ( b)- ( 1,8) naphthyridin-4 ( 1H)- ones on the Leishmania<pathogen> braziliensis and Leishmania mexicana<pathogen> parasites. The mentioned derivatives have never been evaluated against any parasite strain. In general , an in vitro evaluation on L. ( L) mexicana<pathogen> and L. ( V) braziliensis showed that L. ( L) mexicana<pathogen> was more sensitive to the action of the compounds than L. ( V) braziliensis , either in the promastigote or in the amastigote form. Five compounds exhibited moderate efficacy against L. ( L) mexicana<pathogen> promastigotes , with IC
