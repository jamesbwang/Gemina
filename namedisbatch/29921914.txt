  The recent epidemic of Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) in the Americas has revealed the devastating consequences of ZIKV infection , particularly in pregnant women. Congenital Zika<disease> syndrome<disease> , characterized by malformations and microcephaly in neonates as well as developmental challenges in children , highlights the need for the development of a safe and effective vaccine. Multiple vaccine candidates have been developed and have shown promising results in both animal models and phase I clinical trials. However , important challenges remain for the clinical development of these vaccines. In this Progress article , we discuss recent preclinical studies and lessons learned from first-in-human clinical trials with ZIKV<pathogen> vaccines.
