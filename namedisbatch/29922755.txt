  A negative association between H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> and inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) has been previously reported. There were also case reports suggesting a new onset of IBD 6-12 months after H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication therapy. In a case-control study we investigated whether previous H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication therapy was associated with the risk of developing IBD. IBD outpatients with both Crohn 's disease ( CD) and ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) were enrolled. Age- and sex-matched blood donors served as controls in a 1:2 fashion. Information on demographics , medical history , previous H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection and eradication therapy was recorded. Serum samples for H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> serology testing ( anti-H. pylori-IgG and anti-CagA-IgG) were obtained. Controls that received H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication therapy during the 12 months previous to enrollment were excluded. Overall , 127 IBD patients ( CD N = 90; UC N = 37) and 254 controls were enrolled. The prevalence of H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection ( positive H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> serology and/or previous eradication) in IBD patients and controls was 11 % and 23 % , respectively ( OR 0.4 , 95 % CI 0.21-0.74 , p < 0.003). Four patients ( 3 %) developed IBD ( 3 MC and 1 CU) after receiving successful H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication ( latency 6-12 months). The rate of previous H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication therapy in patents who successively developed IBD was lower but not statistically different from that observed in the control group ( OR 0.43 , 95 % CI 0.14-1.29 , p = 0.16). In our study previous H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication therapy was not associated with the onset of IBD. Whether in a subgroup of patients , H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication therapy may trigger a latent IBD , can not be excluded.
