  Existing measures of health equity bear<pathogen> limitations due to the shortcomings of traditional economic methods ( i.e. , the spatial location information is overlooked). To fill the void , this study investigates the equity in health workforce distribution in China by incorporating spatial statistics ( spatial autocorrelation analysis) and traditional economic methods ( Theil index). The results reveal that the total health workforce in China experienced rapid growth from 2004 to 2014. Meanwhile , the Theil indexes for China and its three regions ( Western , Central and Eastern China) decreased continually during this period. The spatial autocorrelation analysis shows that the overall agglomeration level ( measured by Global Moran & rsquo; s I) of doctors and nurses dropped rapidly before and after the New Medical Reform , with the value for nurses turning negative. Additionally , the spatial clustering analysis ( measured by Local Moran & rsquo; s I) shows that the low ⁻ low cluster areas of doctors and nurses gradually reduced , with the former disappearing from north to south and the latter from east to west<disease>. On the basis of these analyses , this study suggests that strategies to promote an equitable distribution of the health workforce should focus on certain geographical areas ( low ⁻ low and low ⁻ high cluster areas).
