  Since the new species Paracoccidioides<pathogen> lutzii<pathogen> emerged in 2009 , much has been researched on strains previously considered atypical. Still , there is no consensus about recognition of antigens from P.<pathogen> lutzii<pathogen> by antibodies directed to other Paracoccidioides<pathogen> species , which can have great impact on Paracoccidioidomycosis<disease> ( PCM) diagnosis. Current research investigated soluble protein/carbohydrate epitopes from P lutzii LDR2 , Paracoccidioides<pathogen> restrepiensis B339 and Paracoccidioides<pathogen> americana<pathogen> LDR3 recognised by IgG directed to Paracoccidioides<pathogen> brasiliensis<pathogen> Cell free antigens ( CFA) were analysed by: ( a) silver and periodic acid-Schiff staining of SDS-PAGE; ( b) immunoblot ( IB) with rabbit IgG anti-P. brasiliensis<pathogen> Pb18; ( c) IB and ELISA with a pool of PCM patients ' sera before and after treatment with sodium metaperiodate ( SMP) to oxidise carbohydrate epitopes. Both rabbit and human immune sera recognised several antigens of P lutzii LDR2 , P. restrepiensis B339 and P.<pathogen> americana<pathogen> LDR3. P.<pathogen> lutzii<pathogen> 's gp43 was not observed in IB or silver/PAS staining. SMP treatment affected reactions with all 3 CFAs , but more intensely with antigens from P lutzii LDR2. In conclusion , antibodies directed to P.<pathogen> brasiliensis<pathogen> recognised antigens from P lutzii LDR2. The use of any of the recognised antigens in a broad spectrum diagnostic model for Paracoccidioides<pathogen> species complex needs to be further investigated.
