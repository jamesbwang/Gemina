  Bloodstream infection ( BSI) is a well-known cause of morbidity and mortality in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( allo-HSCT) recipients. Here , we conducted a retrospective study to assess the morbidity , etiology , risk factors , and outcomes of BSI in the postengraftment period ( PE-BSI) after allo-HSCT. Forty-three of 316 patients ( 13.6 %) developed 57 PE-BSI episodes , in which 62 pathogens were isolated: Gram-positive bacteria , gram-negative bacteria , and fungi<pathogen> , respectively , accounted for 54.8 % , 35.5 % , and 9.7 % of the isolates. Multivariate analysis revealed methylprednisolone use for graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD) prophylaxis ( odds ratio ( OR) , 6.49; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.49 to 28.2; P = .013) and acute gastrointestinal GVHD ( GI-GVHD) ( OR , 8.82; 95 % CI , 3.99 to 19.5; P < .0001) as risk factors for developing PE-BSI. This finding suggested that GI-GVHD increases the risk of bacterial translocation and subsequent septicemia<disease> Moreover , among patients with GI-GVHD , insufficient response to corticosteroids , presumably related to an intestinal dysbiosis , significantly correlated with this complication. Patients with PE-BSI presented worse outcome compared with those without ( 3-year overall survival , 47.0 % versus 18.6 %; P < .001). Close microbiologic monitoring for BSIs and minimizing intestinal dysbiosis may be crucial to break the vicious cycle between GI-GVHD and bacteremia and to improve transplant outcomes especially in patients who require additional immunosuppressants.
