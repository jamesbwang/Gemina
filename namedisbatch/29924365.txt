  Sporothrix<pathogen> brasiliensis<pathogen> is the main agent of feline and zoonotic sporotrichosis<disease> Given the scarcity of options for sporotrichosis<disease> treatment and the promising activity of diphenyl diselenide ( PhSe) 2 against a diversity of fungal pathogens , this study aimed to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of Sporothrix<pathogen> brasiliensis<pathogen> to ( PhSe) 2 alone and in combination with itraconazole ( ITC). Forty clinical isolates of S.<pathogen> brasiliensis<pathogen> were subjected to broth microdilution method to evaluate their susceptibility to ( PhSe) 2 in concentrations ranging between 0.25 and 128 μg/ml , and to ITC ( 0.0313-16 μg/ml) following the protocol of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI , 2008). All of these isolates were also used to evaluate the interaction between these drugs by checkerboard technique. Geometric mean of ( PhSe) 2 MIC values was 12.12 μg/ml , ranging from 4 to 32 μg/ml , and for ITC was 0.37 μg/ml ( 0.125 to 1 μg/ml). Benefic effect ( additive or synergistic) in the interaction test between ( PhSe) 2 and ITC occurs in 73 % ( 29/40) of the isolates. The promising ( PhSe) 2in vitro activity against S.<pathogen> brasiliensis<pathogen> suggests that it may not only be a potential alternative therapy but also be used as a combination with ITC , which is the first choice of therapy to
