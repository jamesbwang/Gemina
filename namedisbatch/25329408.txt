  Malaria<disease> control program in the Arabian Peninsula , backed by adequate logistical support , has interrupted transmission with exception of limited sites in Saudi Arabia and sporadic outbreaks in Oman. However , sustained influx of imported malaria<disease> represents a direct threat to the above success. Here we examined the extent of genetic diversity among imported P.<pathogen> vivax<disease> in Qatar , and its ability to produce gametocytes , compared to parasites in main sites of imported cases , the Indian subcontinent ( india) and East Africa ( Sudan and Ethiopia). High diversity was seen among imported P.<pathogen> vivax<disease> in Qatar , comparable to parasites in the Indian subcontinent and East Africa. Limited genetic differentiation was seen among imported P.<pathogen> vivax<disease> , which overlapped with parasites in India , but differentiated from that in Sudan and Ethiopia. Parasite density among imported cases , ranged widely between 26.25-7985934.1 Pv18S rRNA copies/Âµl blood , with a high prevalence of infections carried gametocytes detectable by qRT-PCR. Parasitaemia was a stronger predictor for P.<pathogen> vivax<disease> gametocytes density ( r = 0.211 , P = 0.04). The extensive diversity of imported P.<pathogen> vivax<disease> and its ability to produce gametocytes represent a major threat for re-introduction of malaria<disease> in Qatar. The genetic relatedness between P.<pathogen> vivax<disease> reported in Qatar and those in India suggest that elimination strategy should target flow and dispersal of imported malaria<disease> into the region.
