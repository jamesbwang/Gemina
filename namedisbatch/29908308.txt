  Despite the fact that pneumococcal conjugate vaccines ( PCVs) have significantly reduced the rate of invasive pneumococcal diseases through the use of vaccine serotypes , infection with Streptococcus<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> remains a major public health hazard. Serotype-independent vaccines that are economically viable species of common protein antigens such as whole-cell vaccines ( WCVs) are needed. Considering the ongoing debate about the effectiveness of WCVs , a systematic literature review and meta-analysis was carried out to determine the efficacy of WCVs against colonization in mice. A systematic review was undertaken of published studies on the protection ( colonized/uncolonized) of whole cell pneumococcal vaccine in mice. The search terms used were `` whole cell vaccine '' and `` Streptococcus<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> '' in PubMed , Google Scholar , Embase , Web of Science and Scopus engines. Data was extracted from original publications and a meta-analysis was performed on studies divided into sub-groups by the number of inoculations , type of sample , type of adjuvant , time of sampling , design of study and quality of study. Ten eligible articles published from 2000 to 2016 were included in this review. The meta-analysis was performed on eight out of 10 studies and demonstrated that the estimated pooled risk ratios ( RRs) for comparison of colonization between the vaccinated and unvaccinated mice for outcomes 1 and 2 were 0.18 and 0.24 , respectively. Lower RRs were observed in sub-groups that were inoculated with vaccines three times , those using cholera<disease> toxin ( CT) adjuvants and those obtained as tracheal specimens from the mice. The best protocol for use of a WCV is its application with CT adjuvant administered intranasally in three inoculations at doses of 10 ‚Å∏ CFU. Further studies performed under similar conditions to obtain accurate results on the effectiveness of this vaccine are recommended.
