  The probability of HIV<pathogen> transmission through contaminated blood and blood products is eye catching. 5 % -10 % of blood products are contaminated with HIV<pathogen>. Therefore , it is essential to provide safe blood supply to prevent transmission of infectious<disease> diseases<disease>. Current systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the weighted prevalence of HIV<pathogen> in Iranian blood donors. This study was reported according to PRISMA checklist for systematic reviews and meta- analysis. Required data were collected by using key words such as `` HIV<pathogen> '' , `` blood donation '' OR `` blood donors '' , `` epidemiology '' OR `` prevalence '' , `` blood transfusion '' and `` Iran '' , in international databases including PubMed , Scopus , Web of Science , Cochrane , Embase and national databases including Magiran , IranMedex and Scientific Information Databank. Papers were searched until December 2017. Cochran 's Q test and I A total of 49 studies including 5403170 donors entered this meta-analysis. According to analysis , the prevalence of HIV-positive patients among Iran blood donors was estimated 7.9/ 100000 ( 95 % CI: 0.000052-0.000121 %). The highest prevalence was related to the central region of Iran ( 11.3/ 100,000 ( 95 % CI: 0.000063-0.0002 %)) and Kermanshah province ( 49.2/ 100000 ( 95 % CI: 0.000273-0.000888 %)) and the lowest prevalence was related to the eastern region ( 1/100000 ( 95 % CI: 0.000001-0.000072 %)) and Khorasan Razavi province ( 0.9/ 100000 ( 95 % CI: 0.000001-0.000139 %). The overall HIV<pathogen> prevalence in Iranian blood donors is low and satisfying. However , the high prevalence in some regions and provinces should be reviewed more meticulously.
