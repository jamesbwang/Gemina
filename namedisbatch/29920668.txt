  The fish feeding apparatus is among the most diverse functional systems in vertebrates. While morphological and mechanical variations of feeding systems are well studied , we know far less about the diversity of the motions that they produce. We explored patterns of feeding movements in African cichlids from Lakes Malawi and Tanganyika , asking whether the degree of kinesis is associated with dietary habits of species. We used geometric morphometrics to measure feeding kinesis as trajectories of shape change , based on 326 high-speed videos in 56 species. Cranial morphology was significantly related to feeding movements , both of which were distributed along a dietary axis associated with prey evasiveness. Small-mouthed cichlids that feed by scraping algae<pathogen> and detritus from rocks had low kinesis strikes , while large-mouthed species that eat large , evasive prey ( fishes and shrimps<disease>) generated the greatest kinesis. Despite having higher overall kinesis , comparisons of trajectory shape ( linearity) revealed that cichlids that eat mobile prey also displayed more kinematically conserved , or efficient , feeding motions. Our work indicates that prey evasiveness is strongly related to the evolution of cichlid jaw mobility , suggesting that this same relationship may explain the origins and diversity of highly kinetic jaws that characterize the super-radiation of spiny-rayed fishes.
