  To analyze the factors affecting survival and prognosis of patients with high-risk refractory lymphoma treated with autologous peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( auto-PBHSCT). A total of 96 cases of high-risk refractory lymphoma received auto-PBHSCT were selected. The total survival rate after the treatment was analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier curve and long rank test , and the prognosis-related factors were analyzed by univariate analysis and COX regression analysis. The median survival time of 96 patients was 30.67 months , and the overall survival rate of 3 and 5 years after treatment was 81.25 % and 71.88 % respectively. Univariate analysis showed that the patients with high lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) level ( > 245 U/L) , 3-5 scores of international prognostic index ( IPI) , hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) infection , high expression of Ki-67 ( â‰¥ 65 %) and bone<disease> marrow infiltration had lower survival rate ( P < 0.05). COX regression analysis showed that the complete remission was n't reached before auto-PBHSCT and the consolidation therapy was not carried out after auto-PBHSCT , both of them were the risk factors affecting the prognosis ( OR = 0.46 , 0.12 , 95 % CI: 0.22-0.95 , 0.02-0.82 , P < 0.05). Auto-PBHSCT in the treatment of patients with high-risk refractory lymphoma can significantly improve the survival status and prognosis , and the consolidotion therapy should be performed after auto-PBHSCT so as to further improve the long-term survival rate and prolong the survival time.
