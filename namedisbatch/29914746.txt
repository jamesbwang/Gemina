  Chronic Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> infection is associated with a decline in lung function and overall poorer prognosis in the cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> population. Molecular typing of P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> has identified multiple clonal strains with increased virulence and transmissibility. P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> ST235 is an emerging clonal strain with multi-drug resistance and is associated with more virulent infections. Novel cephalosporins , which have recently been introduced to clinical practice , may have higher efficacy against multi-drug resistant bacteria.
