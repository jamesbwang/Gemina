  Kidney transplantation from hepatitis<disease> C<disease> seropositive ( HCV<pathogen> +) donors may benefit hepatitis<disease> C<disease> RNA-positive ( RNA +) candidates , but it is unclear how the willingness to be listed for and accept such kidneys affects waitlist and transplant outcomes. In a single-center retrospective analysis , HCV<pathogen> + transplant candidates ( N = 169) listed from March 2004 to February 2015 were evaluated. All RNA + candidates were offered the option to be listed for HCV<pathogen> + donors. RNA- candidates were listed only for HCV<pathogen>- donors. Fifty-seven patients ( 51 % of all RNA + transplant candidates) willing to accept HCV<pathogen> + donors were listed for both HCV<pathogen> + and HCV<pathogen>- donor kidneys. During 6-year follow up , 43 ( 75 %) of 57 patients accepting HCV<pathogen> + versus 19 ( 35 %) of 55 patients not accepting HCV<pathogen> + received a deceased donor kidney transplant ( P < 0.0001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that willingness to be listed for and accept HCV<pathogen> + kidneys was associated with receiving deceased donor kidney transplant ( P = 0.0016). Fewer patients accepting HCV<pathogen> + donors ( 7 ( 12 %) vs 16 ( 29 %)) were removed from the list due to death or deteriorated medical condition ( P = 0.0117). Posttransplant patient and graft survival rates were not significantly different. Overall patient survival since the listing ( combined waitlist and posttransplant survival) was similar among the groups. HCV<pathogen> RNA + candidates had better access to transplantation and similar overall survival before the era of widespread use of direct-acting anti-HCV agents.
