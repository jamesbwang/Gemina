  Streptococcus<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> is a major pathogen that causes life-threatening diseases , such as pneumonia<disease> , otitis<disease> media<disease> , bacteremia , and meningitis<disease> , worldwide and especially in young children and the elderly. Pneumococcal surface protein A ( PspA) is a widely studied candidate protein vaccine that represents a promising replacement for current polysaccharide and polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines. In this study , we describe a simple method to produce PspA of clade 4 from an Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> expression system using hydroxylapatite and ion-exchange chromatography. Using this method , we successfully expressed soluble PspA4 in 10 L of autoinducing culture medium , with a wet-cell yield of 19 g/L and a final PspA4 concentration of 22.8 mg/L. Additionally , we improved PspA4 purity from 17 % to 70 % in a single step through the use of hydroxylapatite , resulting in acquisition of recombinant PspA4 ( > 95 % purity) at a final yield of 43 % from the starting cell-lysis solution. We subsequently verified the secondary structure molecular weight of recombinant PspA4 by circular dichroism and mass spectrometry , respectively. These results demonstrated a highly efficient method for mass producing PspA4 protein and that can also be applied for purification of PspA proteins from other clades.
