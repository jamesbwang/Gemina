  BACKGROUND Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry ( GC-MS) and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry ( LC-MS) metabolomics have been deployed to detect novel differential metabolites in cases with recurrent spontaneous<disease> abortion<disease> ( RSA<pathogen>). MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifty patients who had recurrent spontaneous<disease> abortions<disease> ( RSAs) and 51 control patients ( age , gestational age , and body mass index ( BMI) match) were enrolled in this study. Untargeted GC-MS and targeted LC-MS were combined to discover and validate the different metabolomic profiles between groups. Score plots of orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis ( OPLS-DA) clearly separated the RSA<pathogen> group from the control group. The variable importance in projection ( VIP) generated in OPLS-DA processing represented the contribution to the discrimination of each metabolite ion between groups. Variables with a VIP > 1 and P < 0.05 were considered to be different variables. We also used MetaboAnalyst 3.0 to analyze the pathway impact of potential metabolite biomarkers. RESULTS Fifty-four metabolites were significantly different between the two groups , as indicated by a VIP > 1 and P < 0.05. The metabolic pathways involving glycine , serine , threonine ( P = 0.00529 , impact = 0.26) , beta-alanine ( P = 0.0284 , impact = 0.27) , and phenylalanine metabolism ( P = 0.0217 , impact = 0.17) , along with the tricarboxylic acid ( TCA) cycle ( P = 0.0113 , impact = 0.19) and the glycolysis pathway ( P = 0.037 , impact = 0.1) are obviously related to RSA<pathogen>. Verification by LC-MS showed that the concentration of lactic acid in RSA<pathogen> was higher than that in the control group ( P < 0.05) , while the concentration of 5-methoxytryptamine was significantly lower in the RSA<pathogen> group ( P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In our study , untargeted GC-MS was used to detect disturbance of metabolism occurs in RSA<pathogen> and targeted LC-MS further was used to show that plasma concentrations of two metabolites ( lactic acid and 5-methoxytryptamine) were different in the RSA<pathogen> compared to the control group.
