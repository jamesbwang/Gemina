  GPR18 is a cannabinoid-activated orphan G protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR) that is selectively expressed on immune cells. Despite its significant potential as a drug target for inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> and cancer immunotherapy , only very few GPR18 ligands have been described to date. In the present study we investigated the structure-activity relationships ( SARs<pathogen>) of ( Z) -2- ( 3- ( 4-chlorobenzyloxy) benzylidene) -6,7-dihydro-2H-imidazo ( 2,1-b) ( 1,3) thiazin-3 ( 5H)- one ( PSB-CB5 , 5) , the most potent GPR18 antagonist described to date. Analogs were synthesized that exhibit broad modifications of the heterocyclic core and/or variation of substituents at the benzylidene moiety. The compounds were investigated in Î²-arrestin recruitment assays as inhibitors of human GPR18 activation by tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC). Selectivity was assessed versus the cannabinoid receptors ( CB
