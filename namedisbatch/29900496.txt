  Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) is a re-emerged human pathogen , belonging to a super serogroup<pathogen> with dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> Infection of ZIKV can lead to severe congenital symptoms , such as microcephaly , in newborns and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome<disease> in adults. To date , no prophylactics and therapeutics are available. Flavivirus<pathogen> envelope ( E) protein represents the major target for neutralizing antibodies , while antibody response is the key correlate of protection against ZIKV infection. A panel of monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs) were found to neutralize ZIKV infection and some of them exhibited strong potential as antivirals. In this chapter , we provide a brief introduction into the history and epidemics of ZIKV. Subsequently , we describe the ZIKV envelope protein and summarize the recent progresses in MAbs development against this virus. The concomitant molecular basis for these protective MAbs is also dissected. This chapter helps to comprehensively understand the interplay between ZIKV E protein and protective MAbs.
