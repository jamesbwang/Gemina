  To evaluate the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA) nasal carriage in patients with diabetic foot ulcer<disease> ( DFU) in Taiwan , and to assess the concordance between colonizing and clinical MRSA isolates from the patients. A total of 354 nasal specimens were collected from 112 to 242 diabetic patients with and without foot ulcer<disease> , respectively. MRSA clinical isolates from DFU wound<disease> cultures were collected for comparison. Nasal carriage rate of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and MRSA was similar between diabetic patients with and without foot ulcer<disease> ( 15.2 % vs. 16.9 % for S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and 5.4 % vs. 1.7 % for MRSA). Nasal S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> colonization was an independent predictor for wound<disease> S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> infection ( Odds ratio ( OR): 5.33 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.61-17.59) , so did nasal MRSA colonization ( OR: 19.09 , 95 % CI: 2.12-171.91). The levels of glycated hemoglobin , and the usage with immunosuppressant agent were associated with S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> nasal colonization while oral hypoglycemic agent usage a protective factor. Sequence type 59/staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec IV or V , the local endemic community-associated clone , accounted for 42 % and 70 % of the clinical and colonizing isolates , respectively. Six of 10 patients with paired colonizing and clinical isolates , either MRSA or methicillin-sensitive S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , had a genetically identical strain from a single patient. Less than one-fifth of patients with DFU have nasal S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , including MRSA , colonization; however , the colonization is significantly associated with S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> diabetic foot infection. Screening for S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> colonizing status in DFU patients might have a potential clinical implication.
