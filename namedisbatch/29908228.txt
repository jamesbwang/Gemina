  Oral biofilm , the cause of dental<disease> caries<disease> and periodontal<disease> diseases<disease> , consists of multiple bacterial species. Streptococcus<pathogen> spp. and Veillonella<pathogen> spp. have been reported as to be initial and early colonizers of oral biofilms. Our previous studies showed that Veillonella tobetsuensis may play an important role on the development of S.<pathogen> gordonii<pathogen> biofilms without coaggregation involving extracellular biomolecules. In this study , the effect of a cyclic dipeptide autoinducer from culture supernatants from V. tobetsuensis at late-exponential growth phase on S.<pathogen> gordonii<pathogen> biofilm was examined. The cyclic dipeptide , identified as cyclo (- L-Leu-L-Pro) by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry , inhibited the development of S.<pathogen> gordonii<pathogen> biofilm. Furthermore , cyclo (- L-Leu-L-Pro) appeared not to cause bactericidal effects on planktonic cells of S.<pathogen> gordonii<pathogen>. This is the first report that oral Veillonella<pathogen> produces cyclo (- L-Leu-L-Pro) in their culture supernatants. Moreover , the results of this study suggest that cyclo (- L-Leu-L-Pro) may have an application to inhibit early stage development of oral biofilms.
