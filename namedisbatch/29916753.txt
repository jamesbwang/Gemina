  To investigate epidemiological trends of infective endocarditis<disease> ( IE) in western Norway a retrospective study was performed. Characteristics of 706 IE admissions from 1996 to 2005 and 2006 to 2015 were analysed and compared using the Chi-square test for categorical variables and the t-test for age. Survival was analysed by multiple Cox regression and reported by the hazard ratio ( HR). Mean annual incidence rates increased from 4.6 to 7.4 per 100,000 inhabitants ( rate ratio: 1.97 , 95 % confidence interval: 1.52-2.56 , p < .001). Non-viridans streptococci , enterococci and Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>) , were all independently associated with increased mortality. The frequency of IE caused by enterococci increased from 3.7 to 13.0 % ( p < .001). The proportion of intravenous drug users ( IVDU) increased from 16.5 to 23.5 % ( p = .015) and had increasing aortic valve involvement ( p = .023). Prosthetic valve endocarditis<disease> ( PVE) constituted 30 % of IE cases in both decades with biological PVE increasing from 9.4 to 22.1 % ( p < .001) and mechanical PVE decreasing from 18.7 to 8.9 % ( p < .001). In the last decade , valve replacement surgery was performed in 37.6 % of the patients , of which 85.5 % received a bioprosthesis. The incidence of IE increased significantly. Non-viridans streptococci , enterococci and S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> were all significantly associated with increased mortality. The increased number of enterococcal IE and the increased number of IVDUs with left-sided IE constituted new challenges. Biological implants were preferred in a majority of patients requiring surgery.
