  Two of the four betaherpesviruses , Cytomegalovirus ( CMV) and human<pathogen> herpesvirus<pathogen> 6B ( HHV-6B) , play an important role in opportunistic infections in hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT) recipients. These viruses are ubiquitous in humans and can latently infect mononuclear lymphocytes , complicating the diagnosis of the diseases they cause. Although the detection of viral DNA in a patient 's peripheral blood by real-time PCR is widely used for monitoring viral<disease> infection<disease> , it is insufficient for the diagnosis of virus-associated disease. Theoretically , end-organ disease should be confirmed by detecting either viral antigen or significant amounts of viral DNA in a tissue sample obtained from the involved organ; however , this is often difficult to perform in clinical practice. The frequency of CMV-associated diseases has decreased gradually as a result of the introduction of preemptive or prophylactic treatments; however , CMV and HHV-6B infections remain a major problem in HSCT recipients. Measurement of viral DNA load in peripheral blood or plasma using real-time PCR is commonly used for monitoring these infections. Additionally , recent data suggest that an assessment of host immune response , particularly cytotoxic T-cell response , may be a reliable tool for predicting these viral<disease> infections<disease>. The antiviral drugs ganciclovir and foscarnet are used as first-line treatments; however , it is well known that these drugs have side effects , such as bone<disease> marrow suppression and nephrotoxicity. Further research is required to develop less-toxic antiviral drugs.
