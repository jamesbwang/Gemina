  The simultaneous circulation of Dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( DENV<pathogen>) , Chikungunya<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( CHIKV) and Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) arboviruses have placed Brazil among the main worldwide endemic areas. Brazilian Northeast region concentrates the highest incidence of infections caused by CHIKV and ZIKV. In Maranhão , the second biggest northeastern state , there are cases of human<disease> infections<disease> caused by these three arboviruses and presence of Aedes<pathogen> aegypti and Aedes<pathogen> albopictus vectors. In this context , this study aimed to investigate the circulation of CHIKV , DENV<pathogen> and ZIKV in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes collected in urban areas of Barra do Corda , Caxias , Codó , São Luís and São Mateus do Maranhão municipalities in the state of Maranhão through Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT-qPCR) technique. 428 Ae. aegypti and 1 Ae. albopictus were collected , which formed 44 pools. Three of these showed positive results for CHIKV: AR832767 ( five Ae. aegypti female collected in Caxias) , AR832784 and AR832785 ( both composed of 20 Ae. aegypti female collected in São Mateus do Maranhão). This study consolidates information about CHIKV circulation in state of Maranhão , as well as the role of Ae. aegypti in the transmission of CHIKV in urban area.
