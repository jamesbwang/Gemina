  Dermatophilus<pathogen> congolensis<pathogen> is a facultative anaerobic actinomycete that causes papular to exudative dermatitis<disease> with crusting in horses. This organism is frequently implicated as a cause of pastern dermatitis<disease> , but few data are available validating the organism 's association with this disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate if D.<pathogen> congolensis<pathogen> is associated with pastern dermatitis<disease> in horses utilizing RT-qPCR. Fifteen client-owned horses diagnosed with pastern dermatitis<disease> and eight client-owned unaffected control horses were utilized for this study. A cross-sectional study was performed. History and physical examination findings were recorded , and samples were collected and tested for D.<pathogen> congolensis<pathogen> utilizing cytological evaluation and RT-qPCR. Dermatophyte culture and superficial skin scrapings were also performed. Ten of 15 horses with pastern dermatitis<disease> had feathered pasterns. Dermatophilus<pathogen> congolensis<pathogen> was identified by RT-qPCR from one nonfeathered horse but none with feathered pasterns. Cytological evaluation identified bacteria in all horses but failed to identify organisms resembling D.<pathogen> congolensis<pathogen> in any horse. Four of 15 horses , all feathered , were positive for Chorioptes mites. Fungal culture was negative for dermatophytes in all horses. All test results were negative for the eight control horses. Dermatophilus<pathogen> congolensis<pathogen> was uncommonly associated with pastern dermatitis<disease> in horses in this population. However , chorioptic mange was commonly associated with pastern dermatitis<disease> in feathered horses and represented an important differential diagnosis for this clinical presentation.
