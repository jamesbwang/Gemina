  An extensive body of theory addresses the topic of pathogen virulence evolution , yet few studies have empirically demonstrated the presence of fitness trade-offs that would select for intermediate virulence. Here we show the presence of transmission-clearance trade-offs in dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> using viremia measurements. By fitting a within-host model to these data , we further find that the interaction between dengue and the host immune response can account for the observed trade-offs. Finally , we consider dengue virulence evolution when selection acts on the virus 's production rate. By combining within-host model simulations with empirical findings on how host viral load affects human-to-mosquito transmission success , we show that the virus 's transmission potential is maximized at production rates associated with intermediate virulence and that the optimal production rate critically depends on dengue<disease> 's epidemiological context. These results indicate that long-term changes in dengue<disease> 's global distribution impact the invasion and spread of virulent dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> genotypes.
