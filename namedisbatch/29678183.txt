  Nasal polyposis is a chronic<disease> inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> of the mucosa<pathogen> of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. The etiology of nasal polyposis is unclear; however , it may be associated with asthma and intolerance to acetylsalicylic acid , possibly altering the redox profile. The study intends to compare the redox profile in polyps surgically removed from three clinical groups of patients with nasal polyposis who were divided according to the presence of asthma and intolerance to acetylsalicylic acid. Patients were divided into three groups: nasal polyposis only ( n = 30); nasal polyposis and asthma ( n = 19); and nasal polyposis , asthma and intolerance to acetylsalicylic acid ( n = 10). The following redox evaluations were performed: enzymatic antioxidant activity of superoxide dismutase , glutathione peroxidase , hydrogen peroxide consumption and glutathione S-transferase; non-enzymatic antioxidant levels of vitamin C , vitamin E and glutathione; levels of the oxidative damage biomarkers carbonyl groups ( measuring protein damage) and malondialdehyde ( measuring lipid peroxidation); and nitrite and nitrate levels. Compared with the polyposis only group , hydrogen peroxide consumption , glutathione S-transferase , vitamin E and malondialdehyde were lower in the asthma group. Total glutathione ( 0.12 ± 0.01 vs. 33.34 ± 10.48 µmol/mg) and nitrite and nitrate ( 0.06 ± 0.01 vs. 15.95 ± 1.38 nmol/mg) levels were higher in the nasal polyposis , asthma and intolerance to acetylsalicylic acid group. In patients with nasal polyposis , asthma may alter the redox profile associated with the hydrogen peroxide and lipid damage pathways , whereas asthma and intolerance to acetylsalicylic acid increase nitrite and nitrate and total glutathione levels.
