  To date , there is limited information on the progression of human<disease> infections<disease> of avian influenza<disease> virus<pathogen> A<pathogen> ( H7N9). This study investigated differential blood protein profiling of a H7N9-infected family cluster to find a slice of crucial proteins concerning disease attack and virus clearance. Plasma samples from one family cluster ( including one index case and one asymptomatic case) were collected at four time points. The protein profiles were identified by isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantification-based quantitative differential LC/MS/MS , and their functional annotations were analyzed by PANTHER and STRING tools. A total of 1257 nonredundant proteins were identified from 3027 unique peptides. Three differential protein profiles for each subject were generated by comparing relative protein abundance between samples of each of the first three time points and the last time point. Gene ontology analysis indicated that differential protein profiles for the two cases were mainly enriched in the biological processes of response to stimulus , immunity , blood coagulation , lipid transport , and cell adhesion. Two groups of proteins with an upward or downward expression change according to the postinfection time points were detected for each case. STRING analysis further indicated that the hubs in the network of these time-dependent proteins were mostly apolipoproteins. Significant perturbation of the response upon viral<disease> infection<disease> occurred immediately after confirmation of H7N9 virus infection. The differential protein profiles shed further light on distinguishing the index case from the asymptomatic one. Furthermore , apolipoproteins may play an important role in the progression of the disease.
