  Previous studies identified an adamantane dipeptide piperazine 3.47 that inhibits Ebola<disease> virus ( EBOV<pathogen>) infection by targeting the essential receptor Niemann-Pick C1 ( NPC1). The physicochemical properties of 3.47 limit its potential for testing in vivo. Optimization by improving potency , reducing hydrophobicity , and replacing labile moieties identified 3.47 derivatives with improved in vitro ADME properties that are also highly active against EBOV infection , including when tested in the presence of 50 % normal human serum ( NHS). In addition , 3A4 was identified as the major cytochrome P450 isoform that metabolizes these compounds , and accordingly , mouse microsome stability was significantly improved when tested in the presence of the CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir that is approved for clinical use as a booster of anti-HIV drugs. Oral administration of the EBOV<pathogen> inhibitors with ritonavir resulted in a pharmacokinetic profile that supports a b.i.d. dosing regimen for efficacy studies in mice.
