  Hepatitis<pathogen> E<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection is usually a self-limited disease. However , during the last years there has been growing evidence for prolonged and chronic<disease> infection<disease> occurring in patients with immunosuppression. Also patients with malignant and rheumatic diseases have been identified to be at risk for chronic hepatitis<disease> E. However , their course and prognosis are not well characterized and there have been no reports of hepatitis<pathogen> E<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection in patients with gynecological cancer. Here , we report three Caucasian females with breast and ovarian cancers presenting with elevation of aminotransferase levels during anticancer treatment. Although only few or no clinical hints suggested hepatitis<pathogen> E<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection , the diagnosis of hepatitis<pathogen> E<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection was confirmed by seroconversion , which might occur with some delay , and/or by polymerase chain reaction. While two patients had a self-limited course , the third patient with a high-risk oncological constellation required ribavirin in order to resume chemotherapy. These cases highlight the need for hepatitis<pathogen> E<pathogen> virus<pathogen> testing in patients with gynecological cancer and elevated aminotransferase levels. Further , these cases show that in selected high-risk patients , ribavirin treatment may be necessary based on the decision of a multidisciplinary team.
