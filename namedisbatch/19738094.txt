  The health of migrants has become an important issue in global health and foreign policy. Assessing the current status of research activity and identifying gaps in global migration health ( GMH) is an important step in mapping the evidence-base and on advocating health needs of migrants and mobile populations. The aim of this study was to analyze globally published peer-reviewed literature in GMH. A bibliometric analysis methodology was used. The Scopus database was used to retrieve documents in peer-reviewed journals in GMH for the study period from 2000 to 2016. A group of experts in GMH developed the needed keywords and validated the final search strategy. The number of retrieved documents was 21,457. Approximately one third ( 6878; 32.1 %) of the retrieved documents were published in the last three years of the study period. In total , 5451 ( 25.4 %) documents were about refugees and asylum seekers , while 1328 ( 6.2 %) were about migrant workers , 440 ( 2.1 %) were about international students , 679 ( 3.2 %) were about victims of human trafficking/smuggling , 26 ( 0.1 %) were about patients ' mobility across international borders , and the remaining documents were about unspecified categories of migrants. The majority of the retrieved documents ( 10,086; 47.0 %) were in psychosocial and mental health domain , while 2945 ( 13.7 %) documents were in infectious<disease> diseases<disease> , 6819 ( 31.8 %) documents were in health policy and systems , 2759 ( 12.8 %) documents were in maternal and reproductive health , and 1918 ( 8.9 %) were in non-communicable diseases. The contribution of authors and institutions in Asian countries , Latin America , Africa , Middle<pathogen> East , and Eastern European countries was low. Literature in GMH represents the perspectives of high-income migrant destination countries. Our heat map of research output shows that despite the ever-growing prominence of human mobility across the globe , and Sustainable Development Goals of leaving no one behind , research output on migrants ' health is not consistent with the global migration pattern. A stronger evidence base is needed to enable authorities to make evidence-informed decisions on migration health policy and practice. Research collaboration and networks should be encouraged to prioritize research in GMH.
