  On the basis of its various advantages and the relevant awareness of physicians , ultrasound imaging has overwhelmingly taken its place in the scientific arena. This is true both from the side of daily clinical applications and also from the side of research. Yet , ultrasound provides real-time ( diagnostic) imaging and ( interventional) guidance for a wide spectrum of muscle disorders. In this regard , this review aims to discuss the potential/actual utility of ultrasound imaging in particular muscle disorders , that is , sarcopenia , spasticity and fibromyalgia/myofascial pain syndrome<disease>. Due to the aging population worldwide and the importance of functionality in the older population , mounting interest has been given to the diagnosis and management of sarcopenia in the recent literature. Likewise , several articles started to report that ultrasound imaging can be used conveniently and effectively in the early diagnosis and quantification of sarcopenia.For spasticity , aside from ultrasound-guided botulinum<pathogen> toxin injections , intriguing attention has been paid to sonographic evaluation of muscle architecture , echogenicity and elasticity in the follow-up of these chronic conditions.As regards painful muscle syndromes<disease> , quantitative ultrasound techniques have been shown to detect statistically significant differences between healthy controls and patients with myofascial pain syndrome<disease>. Ultrasound imaging seems to be a promising tool that indisputably deserves further research in the management of a wide range of muscle disorders. VIDEO ABSTRACT: http://links.lww.com/COSPC/A17.
