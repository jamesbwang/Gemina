  Porcine epidemic diarrhea<disease> virus ( PEDV) is a member of the Alphacoronaviridae genus within the Coronaviridae family. It is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea<disease> , a disease that can have mortality rates as high as 100 % in suckling piglets. PEDV causes severe economic loss , and has been in existence for decades. A panzootic starting in 2010 renewed interest in the development of a universal vaccine toward PEDV. This report details several design changes made to a Hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> core antigen ( HBcAg)- based recombinant vaccine strategy , and their effect in vivo. Initially , several multi-antigen vaccine candidates were able to elicit antibodies specific to three out of four B-cell epitopes inserted into the chimeric proteins. However , a lack of virus neutralization led to a redesign of the vaccines. The focus of the newly redesigned vaccines was to elicit a strong immune response to the YSNIGVCK amino acid motif from PEDV. Genetically modified new vaccine candidates were able to elicit a strong antibody ( Ab) response to the YSNIGVCK epitope , which correlated with an increased ability to neutralize the CO strain of PEDV. Additionally , the location of the inserted PEDV epitopes within the vector protein was shown to affect the immune recognition toward the native HBcAg during vaccination.
