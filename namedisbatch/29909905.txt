  Human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) type 16 infection is one of the most important etiological agents of oropharyngeal<disease> squamous cell carcinoma. Patients with HPV-associated carcinomas of the head and neck were reported to have a better clinical outcome than patients with HPV-negative tumors. Because HPV16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins are highly immunogenic and constitutively expressed , HPV-specific T cell immunity may play the key role in improving the prognosis of these patients. Tumor-derived T cells were expanded in high levels of IL-2 and stimulated with HPV16 E6/E7 peptides in the presence or absence of anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab and soluble Tim-3. HPV16-specific tumor-infiltrating T cells were present in 73.1 % of HPV-associated oropharyngeal<disease> tumors. HPV16 specific CD8 + TILs were able to produce IFNγ upon specific stimulation and predominantly expressed PD-1 but not Tim-3. Specific IFNγ production was further enhanced after a blockade of both PD-1 and Tim-3 pathways but not after a PD-1 blockade alone. Additionally , the specific stimulation of anti-HPV16 CD8 + T cells suppressed Tim-3 upregulation after the PD-1 blockade. Our data provide the rationale for combination cancer immunotherapy approaches , including the dual blockade of PD-1 and Tim-3 and , potentially , the use of HPV16-directed therapeutic vaccines.
