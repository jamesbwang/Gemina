  Previous outcome studies comparing implant and autologous breast reconstruction techniques have been limited by short-term follow-up , single-center design , and a lack of rigorous patient-reported outcome data. An understanding of the expected satisfaction and breast-related quality of life associated with each type of procedure is central to the decision-making process. To determine outcomes reported by patients undergoing postmastectomy breast reconstruction using implant or autologous techniques 2 years after surgery. Patients were recruited from 11 centers ( 57 plastic surgeons) across North<pathogen> America for the Mastectomy Reconstruction Outcomes Consortium study , a prospective , multicenter trial , from February 1 , 2012 , to July 31 , 2015. Women undergoing immediate breast reconstruction using implant or autologous tissue reconstruction after mastectomy for cancer treatment or prophylaxis were eligible. Overall , 2013 women ( 1490 implant and 523 autologous tissue reconstruction) met the inclusion criteria. All patients included in this analysis had 2 years of follow-up. Procedure type ( ie , implant vs autologous tissue reconstruction). The primary outcomes of interest were scores on the BREAST-Q , a validated , condition-specific , patient-reported outcome instrument , which were collected prior to and at 2 years after surgery. The following 4 domains of the BREAST-Q reconstruction module were evaluated: satisfaction with breasts<disease> , psychosocial well-being , physical well-being , and sexual well-being. Responses from each scale were summed and transformed on a 0 to 100 scale , with higher numbers representing greater satisfaction or quality of life. Of the 2013 women in the study ( mean ( SD) age , 48.1 ( 10.5) years for the group that underwent implant-based reconstruction and 51.6 ( 8.7) years for the group that underwent autologous reconstruction) , 1217 ( 60.5 %) completed questionnaires at 2 years after reconstruction. After controlling for baseline patient characteristics , patients who underwent autologous reconstruction had greater satisfaction with their breasts<disease> ( difference , 7.94; 95 % CI , 5.68-10.20; P < .001) , psychosocial well-being ( difference , 3.27; 95 % CI , 1.25-5.29; P = .002) , and sexual well-being ( difference , 5.53; 95 % CI , 2.95-8.11; P < .001) at 2 years compared with patients who underwent implant reconstruction. At 2 years , patients who underwent autologous reconstruction were more satisfied with their breasts<disease> and had greater psychosocial well-being and sexual well-being than did those who underwent implant reconstruction. These findings can inform patients and their clinicians about expected satisfaction and quality of life outcomes of autologous vs implant-based procedures and further support the adoption of shared decision making in clinical practice.
