  Candida could become the second most frequent cause of nosocomial urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> Although Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> is the most important species , others have arisen as emerging pathogens. The aim of this study was to analyze the presence of candiduria in inpatients. We performed a retrospective study of Candida isolates from adult inpatient urocultures over five years , gathering and tabulating data on: the species; susceptibility to fluconazole , amphotericin B , and voriconazole ( Vitek2 , BioMerieux); presence of catheter; hospital department of origin; and patient age and sex. We detected 289 yeast episodes , observing an annual increase: 134 ( 46.4 %) were non-C. albicans<pathogen> yeasts , with 57 ( 19.7 %) being Candida<pathogen> glabrata<pathogen> , 37 ( 12.8 %) Candida<pathogen> tropicalis<pathogen> , 25 ( 8.6 %) Candida<pathogen> parapsilosis<pathogen> , and 10 ( 3.5 %) Candida lusitaniae<pathogen>. Most isolates derived from catheterized ( 240 , 83.0 %) and Internal Medicine Department ( 118 , 40.8 %) patients , observing an annual increase; 152 ( 52.6 %) isolates were from males , and the mean age was > 65 years. Susceptibility to antifungals was > 85 %. Inpatient urocultures should include data on the presence of Candida , which is more prevalent in Internal Medicine Department inpatients , in those with urinary catheter , and in over 65-year-olds. Almost half of the isolates were non-C. albicans<pathogen> yeasts , and we recommend complete identification of the species involved.
