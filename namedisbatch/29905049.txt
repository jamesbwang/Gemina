  To explore the clinical application of combined transverse upper gracilis<pathogen> flap and adductor magnus perforator flap in breast reconstruction of breast cancer patients after mastectomy. Between August 2016 and February 2017 , the combined transverse upper gracilis<pathogen> flap and adductor magnus perforator flap was used in 12 cases of breast cancer patients who received modified radical surgery for breast reconstruction. All patients were females with the age of 32 to 59 years ( mean , 41.5 years). There were 7 cases in left side and 5 cases in right side. Eight cases were received breast reconstruction by one-stage operation and 4 cases by two-stage operation. In one-stage operation cases , pathological diagnosis includes invasive ductal carcinoma in 4 cases and invasive lobular carcinoma in 4 cases. The disease duration ranged from 2 to 9 months ( mean , 4.5 months). In two-stage operation cases , the time interval between mastectomy and breast reconstruction ranged from 12 to 70 months ( mean , 37.4 months). The length of flap was 20-28 cm , the width of flap was 5.5-7.5 cm , the thickness of flap was 2.5-4.5 cm. The length of gracilis<pathogen> flap pedicle was 6.5-9.2 cm , the length of adductor magnus perforator flap pedicle was 7.5-10.4 cm. The weight of flap was 295-615 g. The ischemia time of flap ranged from 95 to 230 minutes ( mean , 135 minutes). All flaps were successfully survived. All incisions of recipient donor sites healed by first intention. All patients were followed up 7-14 months ( mean , 9.5 months). The reconstructed breasts<disease> ' shape , texture , and elasticity were good and no flap contracture deformation happened. Only linear scar left in the donor sites , but the function of thighs was not affected. No local recurrence happened during follow-up. With appropriate patient selection and surgical technique , the combined transverse upper gracilis<pathogen> flap and adductor magnus perforator flap can be a valuable option as an alternative method for autologous breast reconstruction.
