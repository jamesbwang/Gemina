  This article describes the epidemiology of malaria<disease> in Yulin , 1999-2016. We review also malaria<disease> control strategy in Yulin in the posteradication phase. We examined all malaria<disease> case records from Yulin prefecture reported to the Ministry of Health since 1999 and extracted malaria<disease> data between 1999 and 2003 , the stage of malaria<disease> eradication , from the notifiable disease reporting records and case records of Guangxi. Malaria<disease> data between 2004 and 2016 , the stage of malaria<disease> elimination , was obtained from the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System and National Malaria Reporting System. We collected mosquitoes with light traps in the vector-breeding seasons and did the distinguished work with optical microscope. Malaria<disease> average incidence decreased to 0.085/ 100,000 , peaking of 0.263/ 100,000 in 2006 , and no cases in years 2001 , 2009 , and 2010. Peak seasons are in November and June with proportions of 16.48 % and 14.29 % , respectively. Pathogenic parasites differed in the two stages; Plasmodium<pathogen> vivax<pathogen> was prevalent between 1999 and 2010 , and Plasmodium<pathogen> falciparum<pathogen> between 2011 and 2015. Most malaria<disease> cases in the last 18 years occurred in males between 20 and 50 years of age. Of the 91 malaria<disease> cases acquired outside Yulin between 1999 and 2016 , 31.87 % were acquired in other provinces of China , and 68.13 % were acquired in foreign countries. Sporozoite-positive vectors were zero between 1999 and 2016. In Yulin , between 1999 and 2016 , autochthonous malaria<disease> cases decreased to zero. The personal preventative measures of surveillance-treatment-follow-up have been demonstrated to be effective in the Yulin malaria<disease> elimination campaign between 1999 and 2016. The major threat of malaria<disease> reintroduction to Yulin lies in imported malaria<disease> , especially by returning employees working in epidemic areas such as Africa and Southeast Asia. Data concerning employees who have worked abroad should be gathered to enable the construction of a mathematic model to forecast future trends of malaria<disease> in Yulin. The antimalaria campaign has to work closely with local authorities.
