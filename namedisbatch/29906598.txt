  Antimicrobial resistance ( AMR) in leprosy<disease> is mostly unknown because Mycobacterium<pathogen> leprae<pathogen> does not grow in vitro and bacteriologic investigations have been abandoned. However , molecular detection of resistance can be applied to multibacillary cases. Patients living in France mainland or in the French territories and diagnosed with leprosy<disease> from 2001 to 2015 were prospectively studied for AMR by detecting mutations in rpoB for rifampicin resistance , in folP1 for dapsone and in gyrA for ofloxacin. Single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) genotypes 1-4 were determined for resistant strains. Of 334 skin biopsy samples received for suspicion of leprosy<disease> , 184 ( 55.1 %) were positive for M.leprae ( acid-fast bacilli and M. leprae-specific repetitive element PCR) corresponding to 160 multibacillary cases. AMR was detected in 18 cases ( 11.3 %): 13 cases ( 8.1 %) of dapsone resistance , three ( 1.9 %) rifampicin and two ( 1.3 %) ofloxacin. There were no strains with multidrug resistance. The mutations ( numbering system of M.leprae TN strain genome) found were P55L ( n = 7) , T53I ( n = 5) , T53A ( n = 1) in folP1; S456L ( n = 2) and S456F ( n = 1) in rpoB; and A91V ( n = 2) in gyrA. Resistance proportion differ significantly between new and relapse cases ( 9/127 , 7.0 % , vs. 9/33 , 25.7 % , p 0.003). The frequency distribution of SNP1-4 types of resistant strains was two , one , 12 and three with five SNP3 cases from New Caledonia harbouring the same T53I FolP1 substitution. This is the first report of AMR surveillance for new and relapse cases of leprosy<disease> in Europe. Detection of resistance helped in individual treatment as well as in epidemiologic investigations.
