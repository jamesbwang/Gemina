  This study aimed at unprecedented physical and chemical evaluation of the ` green plastics ' polyhydroxyalkanoates ( PHAs) , in an extremely halotolerant Halomonas elongata<pathogen> strain 2FF under high salt concentration. The investigated bacterial strain was isolated from the surface water of the hypersaline Fără Fund Lake. The 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogeny and phenotypic analysis indicated that the isolate belonged to Halomonas elongata<pathogen>. PHA inclusions<disease> were observed by Sudan Black B , Nile<disease> Red staining and by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) during growth at high salinity ( 10 % , w/v , NaCl) on 1 % ( w/v) D-glucose. The produced polymer was quantitatively and qualitatively assessed using crotonic acid assay , elemental analysis , Fourier Transform Infrared ( FTIR) , and Raman spectroscopies. Additionally , X-ray powder diffraction ( XRPD) , Overall , our investigations pointed out that the halotolerant H. elongata<pathogen> strain 2FF was capable to produce significant amounts of PHB from D-glucose and PHAs from various carbon substrates at high salt concentrations. The tested strain showed the ability for significant production of natural , biodegradable polymers under nutrient limitation and hypersaline conditions suggesting its potentiality for further metabolic and molecular investigations toward enhanced biopolymer production. Additionally , this study reports on the unprecedented use of Raman and XPRD techniques to investigate PHAs of an extremely halotolerant bacterium<pathogen> , thus expanding the repertoire of physical methods to study green plastics derived from extremophilic microorganisms.
