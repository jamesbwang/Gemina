  Flaviviruses account for most arthropod-borne cases of human encephalitis<disease> in the world. However the exact mechanisms of injury to the central nervous system ( CNS) during Flavivirus<pathogen> infections remain poorly understood. Microglia are the resident immune cell of the CNS and are important for multiple functions , including control of viral pathogenesis. Utilizing a pharmacologic method of microglia depletion ( PLX5622 , Plexxikon Inc , an inhibitor of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor) we sought to determine the role of microglia in Flaviviral pathogenesis. Depletion of microglia resulted in increased mortality and viral titer in the brain following infection with either West<pathogen> Nile<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( WNV) or Japanese<pathogen> encephalitis<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( JEV<pathogen>). Interestingly , microglial depletion did not prevent virus-induced increases in the expression of relevant cytokines and chemokines at the mRNA level. In fact , the expression of several pro-inflammatory genes was increased in virus-infected , microglial-depleted mice compared to virus-infected , untreated controls. In contrast , and as expected , expression of the macrophage marker triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 ( TREM-2
