  To determine the seroprevalence of dengue<disease> in central and eastern Sudan and the breadth of neutralising antibody responses. Blood was drawn from 483 patients with fever<disease> who visited outpatient clinics in Port Sudan , Red Sea state , in three towns in Kassala state and in El Obeid , North Kordofan , in December 2012 and January 2013. Sera were tested for dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> IgG and IgM by ELISA ( Panbio) and sera without serologic evidence of acute<disease> infection<disease> ( IgM negative) were used for the analysis of the seroprevalence. DENV<pathogen> neutralisation tests were performed to determine the specificity of the ELISA and to examine the degree of cross-neutralisation of multiple DENV<pathogen> serotypes. Sixty-seven per cent ( 302 of 448) of the sera were dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> IgG-positive. The seroprevalence in Port Sudan was 89 % ( 106 of 119 sera) , in Kassala 61 % ( 128 of 209) and in North Kordofan 56.7 % ( 68 of 120). Thirty-one of 32 ELISA-positive sera neutralised dengue viruses indicating that the ELISA was highly specific. The majority of the sera broadly neutralised all four dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> serotypes indicating multiple infections. The majority of the population in central and eastern Sudan has been infected with dengue viruses , many people repeatedly. The high seroprevalence underscores the need for extended dengue surveillance in Sudan , broad disease awareness in medical institutions and in the population and diagnostic capacity building for severe dengue infections.
