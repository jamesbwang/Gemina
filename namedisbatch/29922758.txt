  Nowadays , interferon-free therapy using new direct-acting antivirals ( DAA) has dramatically increased the cure rate across different HCV-infected patient populations , including groups traditionally viewed as difficult-to-treat ( patients with co-infections , cirrhosis and liver transplant- LT recipients) with marked improvement in safety and tolerability. To present our experience with DAA therapy in LT recipients , as well as to compare pre- and post-treatment liver stiffness ( LS) and noninvasive fibrosis<disease> scores. Our cohort consisted of 89 patients with genotype 1 ( GT1) recurrent hepatitis<disease> C<disease> after LT. Seventy six patients received ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir + ribavirin and 13 sofosbuvir/ledipasvir +/- ribavirin. Fibroscan ® , FIB4 and APRI scores were performed in all patients before and 12 weeks after DAA therapy. We analyzed 45 ( 50.5 %) males and 44 ( 49.5 %) females with a mean age of 55 +/ -7.7 years. Median time since LT was 20.9 months. At baseline , 53 ( 59.6 %) of patients had severe necroinflammation at Fibromax ®; advanced fibrosis<disease> ( F3 , F4) was encountered in 35 ( 39.4 %) and grade 3 steatosis in 33 ( 37.1 %) of LT recipients. End of therapy ( EOT) virological response ( VR) was 100 %. Sustained virological response 12 weeks after therapy ( SVR12) was 97.7 % in the intention-to-treat analysis and 100 % in per protocol analysis. There was a significant improvement in LS between antiviral therapy initiation and SVR12: 11.9 +/ -1.05 kPa vs 8.8 +/ -0.6 kPa ( p < 0.0001) , as well as in APRI ( 2.7 +/ -0.3 vs 0.4 +/ -0.05 , p < 0.0001) and FIB4 ( 4.6 +/ -0.5 vs 2.5 +/ -0.2 , p < 0.0001) scores. In HCV<pathogen> positive recipients , DAA regimens are highly effective and safe. A significant decrease of LS by transient elastography and fibrosis<disease> non-invasive scores can be observed after successful therapy.
