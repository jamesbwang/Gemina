  Cellular antiviral programs can efficiently inhibit viral<disease> infection<disease>. These programs are often initiated through signaling cascades induced by secreted proteins such as type I interferons , IL-6 or TNF-Î±. Here , we generated an arrayed library of 756 human secreted proteins to perform a secretome screen focused on the discovery of novel modulators of viral entry and/or replication. The individual secreted proteins were tested for their capacity to inhibit infection by two replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses ( VSV) with distinct glycoproteins utilizing different entry pathways. Fibroblast growth factor 16 ( FGF16) was identified and confirmed as the most prominent novel inhibitor of both VSVs and therefore of viral replication and not entry. Importantly , an antiviral interferon signature was completely absent in FGF16 treated cells. Nevertheless , the antiviral effect of FGF16 is broad as it was evident on multiple cell types and also on infection of Coxsackievirus<pathogen> In addition , other members of the FGF family also inhibited viral<disease> infection<disease>. Thus , our unbiased secretome screen revealed a novel protein family capable of inducing a cellular antiviral state. This previously unappreciated role of the FGF family may have implications for the development of new antivirals and the efficacy of oncolytic virus therapy.
