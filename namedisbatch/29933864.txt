  Tuberculosis<disease> is a contagious disease caused by Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> It represents , according to WHO , one of the most leading causes of death worldwide. This was a retrospective analytical cross sectional study done to review all cases of tuberculosis<disease> newly diagnosed at RHUH during 10 years period ( 2005-2015). 128 TB labeled patients were retrieved. A standardized checklist was used to collect data. Patients were then classified as TB diseased and TB infected. The total number of TB suspected patients was 128 over 10 years which represents 1.77 % of all patients admitted to the medical floor. Among these , the total number of PPD positive patients was 40.6 % from our study population ( 2005-2015) , 48 % were TB infected and 52 % had positive CXR. Among those with positive CXR , 41 % were confirmed TB disease and 59 % not confirmed TB disease. There was significant variation in evolution through years ( 2005-2015). By comparing the socio-demographic findings between TB disease , TB infection and non-TB group no statistical significance was found. Same analysis were repeated between TB infection and TB disease groups showed one significant association between age and TB disease vs. TB infection ( p = 0.034) , where the younger population belongs to TB infected group ( 42 %) , while 50 % of TB diseased group were older. As for scoring severity index , ANOVA in the three groups showed a significant association with a p value of 0.046. The TB diseased patients have the highest severity score index. TB disease is still present in Lebanon with fluctuating level with the highest peak found in 2013 explained by the influx of Syrian refugee population. Followed by a gradual drop in the following years. The younger population belongs to TB infected group , while TB disease patients had the most severe clinical course compared to TB infected and non TB patients.
