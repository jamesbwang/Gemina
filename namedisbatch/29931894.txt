  To investigate the role of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 4 ( NADPH4 , NOX4) and transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-β) involve in pathogenesis of airway remodeling in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). Lung tissues from 36 COPD patients and 19 patients with normal lung function were enrolled in this study. The volume of airway smooth muscle ( ASM) mass was evaluated. The expressions of NOX4 , collagen Ⅳ ( Col<pathogen> Ⅳ) and TGF-β were tested by a semi-quantitative morphological and/or immunohistochemistry staining method and Western blot , and their correlations with pulmonary functions were analyzed. ① Index of the percentage of the thickness of ASM/external diameter of small airway ( WT %) and the percentage of the area of ASM/transverse area of small airway ( WA %) were significantly higher in the COPD group than those in controls ( ① The airway remodeling of COPD is characterized by increasing hyperplasia<disease> of small airway smooth muscle. ② Remodeling of airway smooth muscle associats with severity of airflow limitation in COPD patients. ③ The expressions of NOX4 , TGF-β and α-SMA in COPD epithelial cells and small airway smooth muscle cells are significantly enhanced. The expressions of NOX4 , α-SMA and TGF-β are positively correlated with the severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary air flow , suggesting that TGF-β and NOX4 signaling may be involved in the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease airway remodeling.
