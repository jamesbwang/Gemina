  To examine temporal trend in uptake of seasonal influenza<disease> vaccine ( SIV<pathogen>) in the UK and explore disease and demographic factors associated with vaccination. From the Clinical Practice Research Datalink , 32 751 people with auto-immune rheumatic diseases prescribed DMARDs between 2006 and 2016 were identified. The proportion vaccinated between 1 September of one year and 31 March of the next year was calculated and stratified by age , other indications for vaccination , auto-immune rheumatic diseases type and number of DMARDs prescribed. Stata and Joinpoint regression programs were used. SIV<pathogen> uptake was high in those aged ⩾ 65 years ( 82.3 and 80.7 % in 2006-07 and 2015-16 , respectively). It was significantly lower in other age groups , but improved over time with 51.9 and 61.9 % in the 45-64 year age group , and 32.3 and 50.1 % in the < 45 year age group being vaccinated in 2006-07 and 2015-16 , respectively. While 64.9 % of the vaccinations in those ⩾ 65 years old occurred by 3 November , in time to mount a protective immune response before the influenza<disease> activity becomes substantial in the UK , only 38.9 % in the 45-64 year and 26.2 % in the < 45 year age group without any other reason for vaccination received SIV<pathogen> by this date. Women , those with additional indications for vaccination , on multiple DMARDs and with SLE were more likely to be vaccinated. SIV<pathogen> uptake is low in the under 65s , and the majority of them are not vaccinated in time. Additional effort is required to promote timely uptake of SIV<pathogen> in this population.
