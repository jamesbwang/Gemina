  From 2016 through the middle of 2017 , the German Consiliary Laboratory on Diphtheria noted an increase in nontoxigenic Corynebacterium<pathogen> diphtheriae<pathogen> isolates submitted from cities in northern Germany. Many patients for whom epidemiologic data were available were homeless , alcohol or drug abusers , or both. After performing routine diagnostics and multilocus sequence typing ( MLST) , we analyzed isolates of sequence type ( ST) 8 and previously submitted isolates by whole-genome sequencing. Results were analyzed for phylogenetic relationship by core genome MLST ( cg-MLST) and whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism profiles. Next-generation sequencing-based cg-MLST revealed several outbreak clusters caused by ST8; the geographic focus was in the metropolitan areas of Hamburg and Berlin. To achieve enhanced analytical depth , we used additional cg-MLST target genes and genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We identified patient characteristics and detected transmission events , providing evidence that nontoxigenic C.<pathogen> diphtheriae<disease> infection<disease> is a potential public health threat in industrialized countries.
