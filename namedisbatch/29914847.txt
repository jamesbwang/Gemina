  Gonorrhea<disease> , an important sexually transmitted disease , is becoming a growing public health problem around the globe. Vaccination is considered the best long-term approach for control of infection. In this study , we designed a novel Neisseria<pathogen> gonorrhoeae<pathogen> ( N.<pathogen> gonorrhoeae<pathogen>) DNA vaccine delivered by bacterial ghosts and characterized its immune responses in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that bacterial ghosts greatly promoted BMDCs maturation and activation. Bacterial ghosts loaded with N.<pathogen> gonorrhoeae<pathogen> DNA vaccine were efficiently taken up by mouse macrophage RAW264 .7 cells. Furthermore , oral immunization with the ghost vaccine candidate elicited greater CD4
