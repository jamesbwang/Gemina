  Respiratory viral<disease> infections<disease> cause mild to severe diseases , such as common cold , bronchiolitis<disease> and pneumonia<disease> and are associated with substantial burden for society. To test new molecules for shortening , alleviating the diseases or to develop new therapies , relevant human in vitro models are mandatory. MucilAir ™ , a human standardized air-liquid interface 3D airway epithelial culture holds in vitro specific mechanisms to counter invaders comparable to the in vivo situation , such as mucus production , mucociliary clearance , and secretion of defensive molecules. The objective of this study was to test the relevance of such a model for the discovery and validation of antiviral drugs. Fully differentiated 3D nasal epithelium cultures were inoculated with picornaviruses , a coronavirus<pathogen> and influenza<disease> A viruses in the absence or in the presence of reference antiviral drugs. Results showed that , rupintrivir efficiently inhibits the replication of respiratory picornaviruses in a dose dependent manner and prevents the impairment of the mucociliary clearance. Similarly , oseltamivir reduced the replication of influenza<disease> A<pathogen> viruses in a dose dependent manner and prevented the impairment of the epithelial barrier function and cytotoxicity until 4 days of infection. In addition we found that Rhinovirus<pathogen> B14 , C15 and influenza<disease> A<pathogen> ( H1N1<pathogen>) induce significant increase of β Defensins 2 and Cathelicidin release with different time course. These results reveal that a large panel of epithelial functions is modified upon viral<disease> infection<disease> and validate MucilAir ™ as a pertinent tool for pre-clinical antiviral drug testing.
