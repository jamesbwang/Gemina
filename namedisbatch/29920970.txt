  A severe infectious<disease> disease<disease> characterized with gout , haemorrhage and swellings of kidneys has affected goslings around the major goose-producing regions in China since November 2016. A Novel goose-origin astrovirus<pathogen> ( AStV) , designated as AStV/SDPY/Goose/ 1116/17 ( AStV-SDPY) strain , was isolated from diseased goslings , and experimental reproduction of gout was successful using the AStV-SDPY strain. Additionally , the AStV-SDPY was conducted for its full genome sequencing characterization using next-generation sequencing ( NGS) technique on Illumina HiSeq platform. A complete genome of the AStV-SDPY was 7,252 nt in length and encoded three viral proteins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that AStV-SDPY strain belongs to an independent branch of avian astroviruses , and the nucleotide homology among AStV-SDPY and other classic avian astrovirus<pathogen> strains was only 48.8 % -68.2 %. Results of above data indicated the causative agent of the gosling gout occurring in China is a novel divergent goose
