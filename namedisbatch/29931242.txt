  Chemoreception might play an important role for endemic shrimp<disease> that inhabit deep and dark hydrothermal vents to find food sources and to locate active edifices that release specific chemicals. We compared the chemosensory abilities of the hydrothermal shrimp<disease> Mirocaris fortunata and the coastal related species , Palaemon elegans<pathogen>. The detection of diverse ecologically relevant chemical stimuli by the antennal appendages was measured with electroantennography. The two species can detect food-related odor and sulfide , a short-distance stimulus , via both their antennae and antennules. Neither iron nor manganese , considered as long-distance stimuli , were detected by the antennal appendages. Investigation of the ultrastructure of aesthetasc sensilla revealed no specific features of the hydrothermal species regarding innervation by olfactory sensory neurons. Pore-like structures occurring in the aesthetasc cuticle and dense bacterial covering seem to be unique to hydrothermal species , but their potential link to chemoreception remains elusive.
