  New molecular methods have revealed frequent and often polymicrobial respiratory<disease> infections<disease> in children in low-income settings. It is not known whether presence of multiple pathogens is due to prolonged infections or to frequent exposure. The aim of this study was to analyze short-term pathogen clearance from nasopharynx and the rate of new respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> in febrile preschool children. Children ( n = 207) with uncomplicated acute febrile illness 2-59 months of age presenting to a health center in Zanzibar , Tanzania , April-July 2011 , were included. Paired nasopharyngeal swab samples , collected at enrolment and after 14 days , were analyzed by multiple real-time polymerase chain reaction for Adenovirus<pathogen> , bocavirus<pathogen> , Bordetella<pathogen> pertussis<pathogen> , Chlamydophila pneumoniae<pathogen> , Coronaviruses , Enterovirus<pathogen> , influenza<disease> A<pathogen> and B virus<pathogen> , metapneumovirus<pathogen> , measles<pathogen> virus<pathogen> , Mycoplasma<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , parainfluenza virus , Parechovirus , respiratory<pathogen> syncytial<pathogen> virus<pathogen> and Rhinovirus<pathogen>. An age-matched and geographically matched healthy control group ( n = 166) underwent nasopharyngeal sampling on 1 occasion. At baseline , 157/207 ( 76 %) patients had at least 1 pathogen detected , in total 199 infections. At follow-up ( day 14) , 162/199 ( 81 %) of these infections were not detected , including > 95 % of the previously detected infections with Enterovirus<pathogen> , influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> , influenza<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> , metapneumovirus<pathogen> or parainfluenza virus. Still 115 ( 56 %) children were positive for at least 1 pathogen at follow-up , of which 95/115 ( 83 %) were not found at baseline. Detection of influenza<disease> B<pathogen> on day 14 was significantly associated with fever<disease> during follow-up. The results suggest that children with acute febrile illness in Zanzibar rapidly clear respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> but frequently acquire new infections within 14 days.
