  Auricular reconstruction of congenital microtia patients is a huge challenge for plastic surgeons worldwide. Current techniques usually use a retroauricular fascial flap with skin grafting , often proving to be color mismatched , complex<pathogen> , and with visible scarring. An uncomplicated strategy that results in minimal scarring and a good color match is still required , especially for Asian patients. In the present work , the authors developed a modified technique for auricular reconstruction using a single expanded flap combined with a cartilage framework. Auricular reconstruction was performed in three stages. In the first stage , an 80-ml kidney-shaped expander was inserted in the mastoid region. A gradual expansion period of approximately 2 to 3 months was implemented until the flap achieved an appropriate area , thickness , and softness. In the second stage , the expander was removed and a modified three-layer cartilage framework was inserted into the pocket through the same incision. In the third stage , the reconstructed ear underwent further refinements , including reconstruction of the earlobe and tragus. From January of 2012 to January of 2017 , 683 microtia patients ( a total of 738 ears<disease>) were selected for auricular reconstruction using this technique. The patients were followed up for between 3 months and 2 years. Six hundred forty-two patients were satisfied with the final results regarding the size , shape , projection , symmetry , and clarity of outline. Surgery-related complications occurred in 20 patients. Auricular reconstruction using a single expanded flap combined with a modified three-layer cartilage framework is an effective and efficient technique for microtia reconstruction with satisfying medium-term results.
