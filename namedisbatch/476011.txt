  Seasonal influenza<disease> is a contagious respiratory illness that annually affects millions of people worldwide. To identify currently circulating influenza<disease> virus<pathogen> subtypes , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's International Reagent Resource distributes the World Health Organization ( WHO) influenza<disease> reagent kits , which are used globally by testing laboratories for influenza<disease> surveillance. The data generated by the kits aid in strain selection for the influenza<disease> vaccine each season. The use of animals to produce high quality and quantities of antibodies is critical to the production of these kits. In this study , we assessed the effects and efficacy of repeated sampling from automated plasmapheresis in goats. Analysis of blood samples demonstrated that repeated automated plasmapheresis procedures did not adversely affect the immediate or long-term health of goats. Further , our results indicate that repeated plasmapheresis in goats was capable of generating 2 liters of antibody-rich plasma per goat per week. This volume is sufficient to produce enough WHO influenza<disease> kits to conduct over 1 million tests. Thus , we have shown that the rapid production of plasma in goats can positively impact the public health preparedness and response to
