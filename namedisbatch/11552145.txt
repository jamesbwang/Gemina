  Since most of the studies evaluates diabetics on multiple daily injections therapy and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion may help gain better metabolic control and prevent complications , the objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of dental<disease> caries<disease> , the unstimulated salivary flow rate and the total bacteria load , Streptococcus<pathogen> spp. levels and Lactobacillus<pathogen> spp. levels in saliva and supragingival dental biofilm of type 1 diabetics on insulin pump. Sixty patients with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump and 60 nondiabetic individuals were included. The dental<disease> caries<disease> evaluation was performed using ICDAS and the oral hygiene was assessed according to Greene and Vermillion Simplified Oral Hygiene Index. Unstimulated saliva and supragingival dental biofilm were collected. Total bacteria , Streptococcus<pathogen> spp. and Lactobacillus<pathogen> spp. was quantified by qPCR. Patients with type 1 diabetes had a higher prevalence of dental<disease> caries<disease> and filled and missing teeth when compared with the control group. These patients were associated with more risk factors for the development of dental<disease> caries<disease> , namely a lower unstimulated salivary flow rate and a higher bacterial load in saliva and dental biofilm. Some risk factors related to dental<disease> caries<disease> were associated with type 1 diabetics. An early diagnosis combined with the evaluation of the risk profile of the diabetic patient is imperative , allowing the dental<disease> caries<disease> to be analyzed through a perspective of prevention and the patient to be integrated into an individualized oral health program.
