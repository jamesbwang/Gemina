  A 52-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> genotype 3 infection developed clinically symptomatic mixed cryoglobulinemia. She started pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy and in week 12 became negative for HCV<pathogen> RNA with resolution of clinical signs of cryoglobulinemia. The dual treatment was discontinued due to interferon-related bilateral retinopathy. After therapy cessation , relapse of HCV<pathogen> RNA and recurrence of symptomatic cryoglobulinemia were observed. While waiting for the antiviral retreatment option she developed glomerulonephritis<disease> with renal impairment. Successful HCV<pathogen> eradication was achieved with 24-week treatment of sofosbuvir and ribavirin despite this regimen being considered as suboptimal therapy for genotype 3 HCV<pathogen> infection. A sustained virological response resulted in lasting resolution of clinical symptoms of mixed cryoglobulinemia.
