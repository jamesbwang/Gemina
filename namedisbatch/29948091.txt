  Despite considerable efforts toward vaccine development over decades , there is no available effective vaccine against Plasmodium<pathogen> vivax<pathogen> Thrombospondin-related adhesive protein of P.<pathogen> vivax<disease> ( PvTRAP) is essential for sporozoite motility and invasions into mosquito 's salivary gland and vertebrate 's hepatocyte; hence , it is a promising target for pre-erythrocytic vaccine. In the current investigation , the role of antibodies and cellular immune responses induced by purified recombinant PvTRAP ( rPvTRAP) delivered in three adjuvants , naloxone ( NLX) , CpG oligodeoxynucleotides ODN1826 ( CpG-ODN) , and 3-O-deacylated monophosphoryl lipid A ( MPL) , alone and in combination was evaluated in immunized C57BL/6 mice. The highest level and the avidity of anti-PvTRAP IgG ( mean OD
