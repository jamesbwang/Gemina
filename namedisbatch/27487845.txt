  Hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV) infection is a world health problem with an estimated 257 million chronically infected people. Indonesia , with 7.1 % prevalence of hepatitis<disease> B<disease> surface antigen ( HBsAg) , is classified as a moderately endemic country. Healthcare workers ( HCWs) are at high occupational risk for HBV<pathogen> infection and potentially becoming transmitters for further infections. In Indonesia , the extent of hepatitis<disease> B<disease> among HCWs and specific control strategy are not available. This study evaluated the seroprevalence of HBV infection and associated risk factors in HCWs from four areas in South Sulawesi , Indonesia. A total of 467 HCWs ( median age 28 years , male/female 89/378) were recruited. All HCWs were classified into three age groups ( < 20-29 , 30-39 , and ≥ 40 years old) , three work types ( administration , non-intervention , and intervention) , and three service periods ( < 5 , 5-9 , and ≥ 10 years). Data on socio-demographic characteristics and risk factors were obtained by questionnaire and serum samples were tested for HBV<pathogen> markers ( HBsAg , its antibody ( anti-HBs) , and antibody to core antigen ( anti-HBc). Chi-square or Fisher 's exact test was used to determine differences in categorical variables , while risk factors were reported as odds ratios ( OR). The prevalence of current HBV<pathogen> infection ( HBsAg +) , exposure to HBV<pathogen> ( anti-HBc +) , and immunity to HBV<pathogen> ( anti-HBs +) was 6.2 , 19.2 , and 26.1 % , respectively. Two thirds ( 66.17 %) of all HCWs did not express any of HBV<pathogen> markers. In relation to the age groups , intervention work-type , and service period of HCWs , increasing trends were observed in the exposure to HBV<pathogen> ( p < 0.001 , p < 0.001 , and p < 0.010 , respectively) and the immunity to HBV by natural infection ( HBsAg- , anti-HBc + , anti-HBs +) ( p = 0.004 , p < 0.001 , and p < 0.010 , respectively). Needlestick injury contributed the highest risk factor ( OR = 1.71; 95 % CI: 1.05-2.77; p = 0.029) for infection acquisition , which mostly occurred in the intervention group ( p = 0.046). Exposure to HBV showed significant association with HCWs ' age , work type , and service period. Needlestick injury was the highest risk factor for the acquisition of HBV , with highest events in the intervention work-type. Two thirds of HCWs were still susceptible to HBV infection. Intervention strategies at the national level are required to mount prevention , control , and management of HBV infection in HCWs.
