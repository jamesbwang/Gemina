  Streptococcus<pathogen> suis<pathogen> is a major swine pathogen causing pathologies such as meningitis<disease> , sepsis<disease> , endocarditis<disease> , and arthritis<disease>. Several surface-bound and secreted proteases produced by S.<pathogen> suis<pathogen> have been identified and proposed as virulence factors. PR-39 is a proline/arginine-rich antimicrobial peptide produced by porcine leucocytes. In addition to play a role in innate immunity , this peptide possesses immunomodulatory properties. In this study , we hypothesized that proteases produced by S.<pathogen> suis<pathogen> inactivate PR-39. Most strains of S.<pathogen> suis<pathogen> tested were relatively resistant to PR-39 , with minimal inhibitory concentration ( MIC) values ≥ 200 μg/ml. The proteolytic cleavage of PR-39by recombinant subtilisin-like protease and dipeptidylpeptidase IV ( DPPIV) of S.<pathogen> suis<pathogen> was assessed by SDS-PAGE. While PR-39 was not cleaved by the subtilisin-like protease , it was time-dependently degraded by DPPIV. Whole cells of S.<pathogen> suis<pathogen> also degraded PR-39. When S.<pathogen> suis<pathogen> was grown in a culture medium supplemented with recombinant DPPIV , its susceptibility to PR-39 was decreased. Activation of brain microvascular endothelial cells with PR-39 resulted in an increased secretion of the chemokine interleukin-8 ( IL-8) thus confirming the immunomodulatory activity of this porcine antimicrobial peptide. However , a pre-treatment of PR-39 with DPPIV completely neutralized the increased IL-8 secretion. In this study , we showed that DPPIV produced by S.<pathogen> suis<pathogen> can degrade PR-39 and neutralize its antibacterial and immunomodulatory properties. This may allow survival of S suis in the central nervous system by resisting to killing by this antimicrobial peptide and delaying the recruitment of phagocytic cells such as neutrophils to the site of infection.
