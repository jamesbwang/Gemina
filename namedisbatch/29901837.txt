  In this study , we collected different levels of altered rocks of a rocky<disease> mountain<disease> and the adjacent soil and characterized the abundance and weathering effectiveness of Bacillus<pathogen> strains. Based on qPCR and culture-dependent approaches , the gene copies or the numbers of Bacillus<pathogen> strains were significantly higher in the soil than in the altered rocks , while the ratio of the gene copies or the numbers of Bacillus strains to those of total bacteria was higher in the less altered rock , followed by the more altered rock and the soil. The relative abundance of the highly active Al-solubilizing Bacillus<pathogen> strains was higher in the more altered rock , followed by the less altered rock and the soil. Among the Al-solubilizing Bacillus<pathogen> species , 30-36 % of them were different between the altered rocks and the soil , however , similar Al-solubilizing Bacillus<pathogen> species were found in the less altered rocks and the more altered ones. The results showed the alteration-related changes in the abundance and mineral weathering effectiveness of Bacillus<pathogen> strains and suggested the ecological adaptation of the mineral-weathering Bacillus populations and their role in mineral weathering in the rock and soil environments.
