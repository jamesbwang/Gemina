  Melanin production has been associated with virulence in various pathogenic fungi<pathogen> , including Fonsecaea<pathogen> pedrosoi<pathogen> , the major etiological agent for chromoblastomycosis , a subcutaneous<disease> fungal<disease> disease<disease> that occurs in South America. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of acid-basic extracted F.<pathogen> pedrosoi<pathogen> melanin particles and fungal cell ghosts obtained by Novozym 234 treatment on their ability to activate the human complement system. The ability of melanin particles and fungal cell ghosts to activate the human complement system was evaluated by complement consumption , immunofluorescence , and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). Unsensitised melanin particles and melanin ghosts presented complement consumption of 82.67 ± 2.08 % and 96.04 ± 1.13 % , respectively. Immunofluorescence assays revealed intense deposition of the C3 and C4 fragments on the surface of melanin particles and ghosts extracted from F.<pathogen> pedrosoi<pathogen>. Deposition of the C3 , C4 , and C5 fragments onto melanin samples and zymosan was confirmed by ELISA. Deposition of small amounts of C1q and C9 onto melanin samples and zymosan was detected by ELISA. Fonsecaea<pathogen> pedrosoi<pathogen> melanin particles and fungal cell ghosts activated the complement system mainly through an alternative pathway.
