  Avian pathogenic Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( APEC) can cause severe<disease> respiratory<disease> diseases<disease> in poultry. The initial interaction between APEC and chicken macrophages has not been characterized well and it is unclear how effective chicken macrophages are in neutralizing APEC. Therefore , the effect of APEC on activation of chicken macrophage HD11 cells was studied. Firstly , the effect of temperature ( 37 vs 41 °C) on phagocytosis of APEC by HD11 cells was determined. The results showed that APEC was more susceptible to being phagocytosed by HD11 cells at 41 °C than 37 °C. Subsequently , the capacity of HD11 cells to kill APEC was shown. In addition , HD11 cells produced nitric oxide ( NO) at 18 h post-infection and a strong increase in the mRNA expression of IL-8 , IL-6 , IL-1β and IL-10 was detected , while IFN-β gene expression remained unaffected. Finally , it was shown that the response of HD11 was partially dependent on viability of APEC since stimulation of HD11 cells with heat-killed APEC resulted in a reduced expression level of these cytokines. In conclusion , APEC induces an effector response in chicken macrophages by enhanced NO production and cytokines gene expression.
