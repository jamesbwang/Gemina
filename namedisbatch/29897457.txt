  Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> is an important opportunistic pathogen , especially in the context of infections of cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF). In order to facilitate coordinated study of this pathogen , an international reference panel of P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> isolates was assembled. Here we report the genome sequencing and analysis of 33 of these isolates and 7 reference genomes to further characterise this panel. Core genome single nucleotide variant phylogeny demonstrated that the panel strains are widely distributed amongst the P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> population. Common loss-of-function mutations reported as adaptive during CF ( such as in mucA and mexA) were identified amongst isolates from chronic respiratory<disease> infections<disease> From the 40 strains analysed , 37 unique resistomes were predicted , based on the Resistance Gene Identifier method using the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database. Notably , hierarchical clustering and phylogenetic reconstructions based on the presence/absence of genomic islands ( GIs) , prophages and other regions of genome plasticity ( RGPs) supported the subdivision of P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> into two main groups. This is the largest , most diverse analysis of GIs and associated RGPs to date , and the results suggest that , at least at the largest clade grouping level ( group 1 vs group 2) , each group may be drawing upon distinct mobile gene pools.
