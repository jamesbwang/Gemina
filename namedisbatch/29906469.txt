  Toxoplasmosis<disease> is a prevalent infectious<disease> disease<disease>. Although most people infected by Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> are asymptomatic , evidence has suggested that this disease might affect some aspects of a host 's behavior and associate with schizophrenia , suicide attempt , changes in various aspects of personality , and poor neurocognitive performance. These associations may play roles in increasing the risk of a number of incidents , such as traffic accidents , among infected people. In this regard , this study aimed to provide summary estimates for the available data on the potential risk of toxoplasmosis<disease> for traffic accidents. To this end , using a number of search terms , i.e. toxoplasmosis<disease> , Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> , traffic accident , road accident , car accident , crash , and prevalence , literature searches ( up to October 1 , 2017) were carried out via 6 databases. The meta-analysis was conducted using the StatsDirect statistical software and a P-value less than 0.05 was regarded as significant in all statistical analyses. Out of 1841 identified studies , 9 studies were finally considered eligible for carrying out this systematic review. Reviewing results of these studies indicated that 5 out of 9 studies reported a significant relationship between Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> and traffic accidents. Additionally , data related to gender showed significant differences between infected and control men and women. Considering age , reviewing the results of these studies revealed a significant difference between the infected people and the Toxoplasma-negative subjects under 45 years of age. However , no significant difference was found between the two groups aged 45 or older. Given these results , it can be concluded that Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> significantly increases the risk of having traffic accidents.
