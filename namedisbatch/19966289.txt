  The periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> has been invoked in the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA). This association relates to the peptidylarginine deiminase of P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> ( PPAD) , an enzyme capable of citrullinating human proteins and potentially contributing to loss of tolerance to citrullinated proteins in RA. PPAD is both retained in the outer membrane ( OM) of P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> cells and secreted into the extracellular milieu , where it is detected in a soluble form and in association with outer membrane vesicles ( OMVs). Recent studies showed that certain P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> proteins are retained in the OM through modification with an A-type lipopolysaccharide ( A-LPS). Here , we investigated the possible involvement of A-LPS modification in the association of PPAD to the OM and OMVs. The results indicate that the OM- and OMV-associated PPAD is A-LPS-modified. The modified PPAD species is of low abundance in particular clinical isolates of P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> , which is not due to defects in the overall synthesis of A-LPS-modified proteins but , rather , to particular traits of the respective PPAD proteins. Lastly , we show that OMV association protects the A-LPS-modified PPAD from proteolytic degradation. Altogether , our observations show that A-LPS modification contributes to OM ( V) sorting and ` protective secretion ' of PPAD.
