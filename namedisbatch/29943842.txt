  Leishmania<pathogen> is a protozoan parasite that resides and replicates in macrophages and causes leishmaniasis<disease> The parasite alters the signaling cascade in host macrophages and evades the host machinery. Small G-proteins are GTPases , grouped in 5 different families that play a crucial role in the regulation of cell proliferation , cell survival , apoptosis , intracellular trafficking , and transport. In particular , the Ras family of small G-proteins has been identified to play a significant role in the cellular functions mentioned before. Here , we studied the differential expression of the most important small G-proteins during Leishmania infection. We found major changes in the expression of different isoforms of Ras , mainly in N-Ras. We observed that Leishmania<pathogen> donovani infection led to enhanced N-Ras expression , whereas it inhibited K-Ras and H-Ras expression. Furthermore , an active N-Ras pull-down assay showed enhanced N-Ras activity. L donovani infection also increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation and simultaneously decreased p38 phosphorylation. In contrast , pharmacological inhibition of Ras led to reduction in the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and enhanced the phosphorylation of p38 in Leishmania-infected cells , which could lead to increased interleukin-12 expression and decreased interleukin-10 expression. Indeed , farnesylthiosalicyclic acid ( a Ras inhibitor) , when used at the effective level in L donovani-infected macrophages , reduced amastigotes in the host macrophages. Thus , upregulated N-Ras expression during L donovani infection could be a novel immune evasion strategy of Leishmania and would be a potential target for antileishmanial immunotherapy.
