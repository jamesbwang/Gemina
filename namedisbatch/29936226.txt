  The intention to include a category of Complex<pathogen> Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( CPTSD) in ICD-11 has renewed interest in this construct. Although growing evidence from high income countries supports the construct validity of CPTSD , little parallel research has been undertaken across cultures. We tested theoretically supported CPTSD structures ( a one-factor , six-factor , one-factor higher-order , and two-factor higher order structure) in a community sample of West<disease> Papuan refugees living in a remote town , Kiunga , in Papua New Guinea ( PNG). A community-wide survey was conducted ( 2016-2017; response rate 85.5 %) amongst 486 West<disease> Papuans. Culturally adapted measures were applied to assess cumulative traumatic exposure , postmigration living difficulties ( PMLDs) , CPTSD symptoms , and functional impairment. A six factor structure for CPTSD provided the best fit to the data , consistent with our past study amongst West<disease> Papuans. The cross-cultural validity of our findings is supported by the isolation of West<disease> Papuan participants from services treating traumatic stress. To further support the universal applicability of CPTSD , our findings need to be confirmed amongst other refugee groups from diverse cultural backgrounds.
