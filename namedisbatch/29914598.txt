  One of the most serious problems in tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) control is non-adherence to treatment. Several strategies have been developed to improve adherence and increase the cure rate. To systematically review interventions to improve adherence to anti-tuberculosis treatment. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 randomised clinical trials ( RCTs) to ascertain whether providing directly observed treatment , short-course ( DOTS) , financial incentives , food incentives and/or patient education/counselling improved adherence to anti-tuberculosis treatment. The primary outcome was cure rate; secondary outcomes were default and mortality rates. Sources used were Medline ( accessed via PubMed) , Cochrane Central , LILACS ( Literatura Latino Americana<pathogen> em Ciências da Saúde , Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature) and Embase from inception to October 2015. A significant increase in cure rates , by 18 % with DOTS and by 16 % with patient education and counselling , was observed. In addition , the default rate decreased by 49 % with DOTS , by 26 % with financial incentives and by 13 % with patient education and counselling. There was no statistically significant reduction in mortality rates with these interventions. Use of DOTS and patient education/counselling significantly improved cure rates; DOTS , patient education/counselling and financial incentives led to a reduction in the default rate.
