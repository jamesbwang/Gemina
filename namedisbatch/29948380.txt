  The high prevalence ( 14.3 %) of HIV/HBV co-infections reported in west<disease> China makes it necessary to screen concurrent HBV infection in HIV<pathogen> carriers. HBV<pathogen> B<pathogen> genotype was shown to be dominant in 54 cases of HIV/HBV co-infection , accounting for 81.48 % of the total. The total drug resistance rate observed was 3.70 %. A1762T , G1764A and G1896A mutations were common mutations identified in the BCP/PC region. However , the prevalence of the G1896A mutation was significantly high among the HBeAg negative HIV/HBV co-infected patients , and may be associated with high HBV replication. Mutations in the PC region are related to the loss in synthesis of HBeAg and may accelerate HBV replication in HIV<pathogen> positive patients.
