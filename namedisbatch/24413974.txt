  Canine parvovirus ( CPV) has been considered to be an important pathogen , which can cause acute infectious<disease> disease<disease> in canids. Although current vaccines are effective in preventing CPV infection , safety problems still remain unsolved. In this study , a subunit vaccine against CPV based on virus-like particles ( VLPs) with good safety and immunogenicity is reported. Soluble CPV VP2 protein was produced by co-expression of chaperone trigger factor ( Tf16) in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( E.coli) , and assembled into CPV VLPs which could be affected by NaCl and pH. At 250 mM NaCl pH 8.0 , the VLPs co-expressed with Tf16 had similar size ( 25 nm) and shape with the authentic virus capsid under the transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) , which is also in accordance with the dynamic light scattering ( DLS) data. Immunization with these particles could induce high-titer hemagglutination inhibition ( 1:12288) and neutralizing antibodies ( 1:6144) in guinea pigs. Splenic cells of them could secrete IFN-Î³ and IL-4 after stimulation by CPV. Thus , the VLPs produced by the new approach with high yield and immunogenicity could be a potential candidate for CPV vaccine.
