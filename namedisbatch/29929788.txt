  We previously demonstrated that miR-214 is upregulated in malignant melanomas and triple-negative breast tumors and promotes metastatic dissemination by affecting a complex<pathogen> pathway including the anti-metastatic miR-148b. Importantly , tumor dissemination could be reduced by blocking miR-214 function or increasing miR-148b expression or by simultaneous interventions. Based on this evidence , with the intent to explore the role of miR-214 as a target for therapy , we evaluated the capability of new chemically modified anti-miR-214 , R97/R98 , to inhibit miR-214 coordinated metastatic traits. Relevantly , when melanoma or breast cancer cells were transfected with R97/R98 , anti-miR-214 reduced miR-214 expression and impaired transendothelial migration were observed. Noteworthy , when the same cells were injected in the tail vein of mice , cell extravasation and metastatic nodule<disease> formation in lungs were strongly reduced. Thus , suggesting that R97/R98 anti-miR-214 oligonucleotides were able to inhibit tumor cell escaping through the endothelium. More importantly , when R97/R98 anti-miR-214 compounds were systemically delivered to mice carrying melanomas or breast or neuroendocrine pancreatic cancers , a reduced number of circulating tumor cells and lung or lymph node metastasis formation were detected. Similar results were also obtained when AAV8-miR-214 sponges were used in neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors. Based on this evidence , we propose miR-214 as a promising target for anti-metastatic therapies.
