  Understanding how regulatory elements control mammalian gene expression is a challenge of post-genomic era. We previously reported that size of proximal promoter architecture predicted the breadth of expression ( fraction of tissues in which a gene is expressed). Herein , the contributions of individual transcription factors ( TFs) were quantified. Several technologies of statistical modelling were utilized and compared: tree models , generalized linear models ( GLMs , without and with regularization) , Bayesian GLMs and random forest<disease>. Both linear and non-linear modelling strategies were explored. Encouragingly , different models led to similar statistical conclusions and biological interpretations. The majority of ENCODE TFs correlated positively with housekeeping expression , a minority correlated negatively. Thus , housekeeping expression can be understood as a cumulative effect of many types of TF binding sites. This is accompanied by the exclusion of fewer types<pathogen> of binding sites for TFs which are repressors , or support cell lineage commitment or temporarily inducible or spatially-restricted expression.
