  Prior to 2006 , nearly every U.S. child was infected with rotavirus<pathogen> by 5 years of age , and rotavirus<pathogen> was the leading cause of severe childhood gastroenteritis<disease> In February 2006 and June 2008 , the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended a live attenuated pentavalent rotavirus<pathogen> vaccine ( RV5) and a monovalent rotavirus<pathogen> vaccine ( RV1) , respectively , for routine vaccination of infants in the United States. Areas covered: We reviewed U.S. data on coverage , vaccine effectiveness ( VE) , and vaccine impact from 2006 to 2017. National rotavirus<pathogen> vaccine coverage estimates increased since vaccine introduction but plateaued at 71-75 % in 2013-2015 , a level 15-20 % lower than that of other routine childhood vaccines. Pooled VE of full series RV5 and RV1 against rotavirus-associated hospitalizations and emergency department visits were 84 % ( 95 % CI: 80-87 %) and 83 % ( 95 % CI: 72-89 %) , respectively. Vaccine introduction resulted in a median decline in rotavirus-associated hospitalizations and emergency department visits of 80 % and 57 % , respectively , along with indirect protection of unvaccinated age groups and a decrease in health-care costs. A biennial pattern in rotavirus<pathogen> detection emerged post-vaccine implementation. Expert Commentary: The increasing use of rotavirus<pathogen> vaccines has substantially diminished the burden and changed the epidemiology of rotavirus<pathogen> disease in U.S. children; efforts to increase rotavirus<pathogen> vaccine coverage should continue.
