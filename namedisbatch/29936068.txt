  The ability to infect and replicate in monocytes/macrophages is a critically distinguishing feature between the two feline coronavirus<pathogen> ( FCoV) pathotypes: feline enteric coronavirus<pathogen> ( FECV; low-virulent) and feline infectious peritonitis<disease> virus ( FIPV; lethal). Previously , by comparing serotype II strains FIPV 79-1146 and FECV 79-1683 and recombinant chimeric forms thereof in cultured feline bone<disease> marrow macrophages , we mapped this difference to the C-terminal part of the viral spike ( S) protein ( S2). In view of the later identified diagnostic difference in this very part of the S protein of serotype I FCoV pathotypes , the present study aimed to further define the contribution of the earlier observed ten amino acids difference to the serotype II virus phenotype in macrophages. Using targeted RNA recombination as a reverse genetics system we introduced the mutations singly and in combinations into the S gene and evaluated their effects on the infection characteristics of the mutant viruses in macrophages. While some of the single mutations had a significant effect , none of them fully reverted the infection phenotype. Only by combining five specific mutations the infections mediated by the FIPV and FECV spike proteins could be fully blocked or potentiated , respectively. Hence , the differential macrophage infection phenotype is caused by the cooperative effect of five mutations , which occur in five functionally different domains of the spike fusion subunit S2. The significance of these observations will be discussed , taking into account also some questions related to the identity of the virus strains used.
