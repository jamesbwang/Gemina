  Malaria<disease> is a deadly disease killing worldwide hundreds of thousands people each year and the responsible parasite has acquired resistance to the available drug combinations. The four vacuolar plasmepsins ( PMs) in Plasmodium<pathogen> falciparum<pathogen> involved in hemoglobin ( Hb) catabolism represent promising targets to combat drug resistance. High antimalarial activities can be achieved by developing a single drug that would simultaneously target all the vacuolar PMs. We have demonstrated for the first time the use of soluble recombinant plasmepsin II ( PMII) for structure-guided drug discovery with KNI inhibitors. Compounds used in this study ( KNI-10742 , 10743 , 10395 , 10333 , and 10343) exhibit nanomolar inhibition against PMII and are also effective in blocking the activities of PMI and PMIV with the low nanomolar K Structural data are available in the PDB under the accession numbers 5YIE , 5YIB , 5YID , 5YIC , and 5YIA.
