  Trichomoniasis results from infection of the protozoan to the mucous membrane of the urethra or vagina. It has been estimated to have a higher incidence rate than both Gonorrhea<disease> and Chlamydia<pathogen> combined. Although females can experience both clinical symptoms and obstetrical complications , male infections are largely asymptomatic and often unreported. We aim to estimate the prevalence of trichomoniasis in US males utilizing the NHANES database. The NHANES database was queried for all men 18-59 years old during the years 2013-2016. During these years , the survey included urine testing for trichomonas infection using PCR. Information was also obtained regarding patient demographics and other sexually transmitted infections. Overall , 0.49 % of men aged 18-59 years tested positive for trichomonas infection. The highest rates were seen in African American men at a rate of 3.6 %. There was no significant association with trichomoniasis and age. Higher rates of infection were seen in smokers , HSV-2 infection , men who had sex at an earlier age , less condom usage , and in those with more lifetime sexual partners. The rates of trichomonas infection in US males are lower than in women. Infections are strongly associated with black males , HSV-2 infection and other factors known to increase STI rates. This information may be helpful for counseling , screening and management of patients.
