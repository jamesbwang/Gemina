  Flaviviruses are positive , single-stranded , enveloped cytoplasmic sense RNA viruses that cause a variety of important diseases worldwide. Among them , Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> , West<pathogen> Nile<pathogen> virus<pathogen> , Japanese<pathogen> encephalitis<pathogen> virus<pathogen> , and Dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> have the potential to cause severe disease. Extensive studies have been performed to elucidate the structure and replication strategies of flaviviruses , and current studies are aiming to unravel the complex molecular interactions between the virus and host during the very early stages of infection. The outcomes of viral<disease> infection<disease> and rapid establishment of the antiviral state , depends on viral detection by pathogen recognition receptors and rapid initiation of signalling cascades to induce an effective innate immune response. Extracellular and intracellular pathogen recognition receptors play a crucial role in detecting flavivirus<pathogen> infection and inducing a robust antiviral response. One of the main hallmarks of flaviviral nonstructural proteins is their multiple strategies to antagonise the interferon system. In this chapter , we summarize the molecular characteristics of flaviviral proteins and discuss how viral proteins target different components of the interferon signalling pathway by blocking phosphorylation , enhancing degradation , and downregulating the expression of major components of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway. We also discuss how the interactions of viral proteins with host proteins facilitate viral pathogenesis. Due to the lack of antivirals or prophylactic treatments for many flaviviral infections , it is necessary to fully elucidate how these viruses disrupt cellular processes to influence pathogenesis and disease outcomes.
