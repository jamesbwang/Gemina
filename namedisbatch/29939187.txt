  The genetically accessible adult zebrafish ( Danio<pathogen> rerio<pathogen> has been increasingly used as a vertebrate model for understanding human<disease> diseases<disease> such as cardiomyopathy. Because of its convenience and amenability to high throughput genetic manipulations , the generation of acquired cardiomyopathy models , such as the doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy ( DIC) model in adult zebrafish , is opening the doors to new research avenues , including discovering cardiomyopathy modifiers via forward genetic screening. Different from the embryonic zebrafish DIC model , both initial acute and later chronic phases of cardiomyopathy can be determined in the adult zebrafish DIC model , enabling the study of stage-dependent signaling mechanisms and therapeutic strategies. However , variable results can be obtained with the current model , even in the hands of experienced investigators. To facilitate future implementation of the DIC model , we present a detailed protocol on how to generate this DIC model in adult zebrafish and describe two alternative ways of intraperitoneal ( IP) injection. We further discuss options on how to reduce variations to obtain reliable results and provide suggestions on how to appropriately interpret the results.
