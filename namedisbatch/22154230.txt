  Influenza<disease> virus<pathogen> RNA polymerase ( FluPol) , a heterotrimer composed of PB1 , PB2 , and PA subunits ( P3 in influenza<disease> C<pathogen>) , performs both transcription and replication of the viral RNA genome. For transcription , FluPol interacts with the C-terminal domain ( CTD) of RNA polymerase II ( Pol II) , which enables FluPol to snatch capped RNA primers from nascent host RNAs. Here , we describe the co-crystal structure of influenza<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> polymerase ( FluPol
