  In this work , we present the efficacy of photodynamic therapy against yeast cells in an animal model. We tested two photosensitizers , methylene blue and protoporphyrin IX. Thirty-seven female BALB-c mice with a body mass of 20-25 g were used. To achieve persistent vaginitis , estrus was induced by subcutaneous injection of 0.1 mg/mL estradiol valerate applied weekly. Three days after pseudo-estrus , intravaginal inoculation with Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> was performed. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine ( 80 mg/kg) and xylazine ( 10 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection before inoculation , and antimicrobial photodynamic therapy ( aPDT) was performed 5 days after fungal inoculation. Two photosensitizers were tested , methylene blue ( MB; 100 μM) and protoporphyrin IX ( PpNetNI; 10 μM). Two custom-made LEDs emitting light at 660 and 630 nm at approximately 800 mW each were used for irradiation. The aPDT treatment reduced the fungal colony-forming units ( CFUs) by one order of magnitude for the MB ( p = 0.020) and PpNetNI ( p = 0.018) photosensitizers. Seven days after the treatment , there were significantly fewer CFUs compared to the control group ( p = 0.041 and p = 0.035 for MB and PpNetNI , respectively) , but this was not increased compared to the initial number immediately after aPDT. Using aPDT as a therapeutic option to decrease fungal infection in a vaginal candidiasis model resulted in a significant reduction in the C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> population. Both photosensitizers were effective for preventing reinfection within 7 days. The aPDT also had no effect on the vaginal mucosa at the ultrastructural level. In addition to the fungicide effect , we observed reduced swelling and lack of the formation of abscesses<disease> , microabscesses coating the cornified epithelial layer , and the accumulation of neutrophils in the submucosa.
