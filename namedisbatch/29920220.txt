  Enteropathogenic Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( EPEC) causes watery diarrhea<disease> when colonizing the surface of enterocytes. The translocated intimin receptor ( Tir): intimin receptor complex facilitates tight adherence to epithelial cells and formation of actin pedestals beneath EPEC. We found that the host cell adherens junction protein E-cadherin ( Ecad) was recruited to EPEC microcolonies. Live-cell and confocal imaging revealed that Ecad recruitment depends on , and occurs after , formation of the Tir: intimin complex. Combinatorial binding experiments using wild-type EPEC , isogenic mutants lacking Tir or intimin , and E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> expressing intimin showed that the extracellular domain of Ecad binds the bacterial surface in a Tir: intimin-dependent manner. Finally , addition of the soluble extracellular domain of Ecad to the infection medium or depletion of Ecad extracellular domain from the cell surface reduced EPEC adhesion to host cells. Thus , the soluble extracellular domain of Ecad may be used in the design of intervention strategies targeting EPEC adherence to host cells.-Login , F. H. , Jensen , H H. , Pedersen , G.
