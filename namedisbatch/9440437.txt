  Patients with diabetes mellitus are more prone to develop infections with influenza<disease> virus<pathogen> and pneumococcus. Once they develop respiratory<disease> infections<disease> , they are twice more likely to die of complication related to the infection. Although there are no Indian guidelines , recent publications have recommended vaccination in patients with diabetes of all ages. Our study was undertaken to find the barriers to the uptake of adult vaccination against respiratory illness among patients with diabetes attending a diabetic clinic in a tertiary care institution. Of the 149 patients interviewed , only 2 % and 0.7 % had been previously vaccinated against influenza<disease> and pneumococcus , respectively. Although 52 % of patients agreed that vaccination was safe and effective , only 17.4 % got vaccinated during the period of observation after counseling. The primary reasons for refusal were financial ( 51.7 %) , while some were not completely convinced of its benefits ( 9.4 %); the other reasons included fear of complications ( 7.4 %) and needles ( 0.7 %).
