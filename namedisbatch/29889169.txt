  Sexually transmitted infections ( STIs) continue to be a major health problem and source of health disparities in the United States. With diminishing resources , public health agencies are challenged to limit inefficient STI practices and still maintain effective population health. The purpose of this study was to implement a text-messaging strategy to convey STI test results and to assess whether texting positive results was associated with a shorter treatment time frame. Quasi-experimental design. Six counties in Florida. Sexually transmitted infection clients in 6 county health departments. Clients tested for gonorrhea<disease> , chlamydia<pathogen> , and syphilis<disease> were given the option to receive their results by a text message or the regular notification process ( phone or follow-up clinic visit). The time to treatment after a positive test result for those clients who received their results by a text message versus the regular notification process. Those who were presumptively treated were excluded from the analysis. Over a 10-month period , 4081 clients were offered the texting option and 47.8 % agreed to participate. For the counties combined , there was a higher percentage of those who received treatment within 1 to 4 days who received their positive test results by text message ( 53.0 %) versus those who received their results by traditional methods ( 42.0 %). In addition , there was a lower percentage of those who either did not get treated or were treated 8 days or more who received their positive test results by text message ( 26.1 %) versus those who received their results by traditional methods ( 35.2 %). Providing a text-messaging option is a viable strategy for clinics to provide timely results to their clients , and these clients were more likely to be treated in 1 to 4 days. Important for public health quality improvement , and increased efficiency and adoption of emerging technologies.
