  Complex<pathogen> multicellular organisms have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to rapidly resolve epithelial injuries. Epithelial integrity is critical to maintaining internal homeostasis. An epithelial breach represents the potential for pathogen ingress and fluid loss , both of which may have severe consequences if not limited. The mammalian wound<disease> healing response involves a finely tuned , self-limiting series of cellular and molecular events orchestrated by the transient activation of specific signalling pathways. Accurate regulation of these events is essential; failure to initiate key steps at the right time delays healing and leads to chronic<disease> wounds<disease> , while aberrant initiation of wound<disease> healing processes may produce cell behaviours that promote cancer progression. In this review , we discuss how wound<disease> healing pathways co-opted in cancer lose their stringent regulation and become compromised in their reversibility. We hypothesize on how the commandeering of wound<disease> healing ` master regulators ' is involved in this process , and also highlight the implications of these findings in the treatment of both chronic<disease> wounds<disease> and cancer.
