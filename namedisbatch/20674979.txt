  Infective endocarditis<disease> ( IE) secondary to Staphylococcus<pathogen> lugdunensis<pathogen> has been increasingly recognized since 1988. IE-related thromboembolism represents an associated complication of the disease and carries a dismal prognosis. However , the incidence of cerebrovascular accident secondary to S.<pathogen> lugdunensis<pathogen> IE is relatively uncommon and its treatment has not been clearly elucidated yet. We performed an extensive literature search using Pubmed , Medline , Scopus , and Google Scholar to identify the articles using the following keywords: ` Staphylococcus<pathogen> lugdunensis<pathogen> ' , ` infective endocarditis<disease> ' , ` stroke ' , and ` cerebrovascular accident. ' Patient characteristics , risk factors , severity of neurological deficit , echocardiographic findings , medical management , required surgical intervention , complications and mortality rate were reviewed in detail. Eighteen cases ( mean age of 47.8 years , 55 % male) from 17 publications with S. lugdunensis-related cerebrovascular accident ( CVA) were identified. Of these , 16 ( 87 %) cases were left-sided endocarditis<disease> and 10 ( 61 %) cases experienced right-sided neurological deficit. The source of infection was documented in eight cases ( 50 %) in which four cases ( 50 %) were related to groin-related procedures and the mitral valve ( 52.5 %) was mostly infected followed by aortic valve ( 37 %). Surgical valve replacement was done in 61 % of patients and overall mortality rate was 22 %. S.<pathogen> lugdunensis<pathogen> endocarditis<disease> is associated with high mortality and morbidity , including a higher prevalence of CVA. Early disease identification with aggressive intervention is crucial for better outcomes.
