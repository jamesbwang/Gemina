  A description of an outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis<disease> among neonates , linked to the putative novel species Clostridium<pathogen> neonatale and assignable to the genus Clostridium<pathogen> , was previously reported in brief but that name had never been validly published ( Alfa et al.. Clin Inf Dis 2002; 35: S101-S105). Features of this taxon group and its phylogenetic position with respect to contemporary species in the genus Clostridium<pathogen> were recently reviewed and still found to be unique. Therefore , we provide here a description based on biochemical , chemotaxonomic and antimicrobial susceptibility testing ( AST) , matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight ( MALDI-TOF) MS , 16S rRNA gene sequencing as well as information obtained by whole genome sequencing ( WGS) for strains 99A005
