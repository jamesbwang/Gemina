  Anecdotal epidemiologic observations can provide valuable tools to study various biologic elements in complex<disease> diseases<disease> such as cancer. Although cervical cancer is one of the most frequent malignancy affecting women in the world , it displays wide geographical variations remnant of socioeconomic , ethnic and genetic predisposing factors. The observed low incidence of cervical cancer in western Asia has triggered scientists to try to delineate the causes of this reduced occurrence. Although this region including Saudi Arabia is known for being conservative societies with low incidence of sexually transmitted infections including human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) and associated cervical cancer , scientific research points out multifaceted biological explanations including host genetic variations. Researchers observed that a protective genetic variant TP53 codon 72 proline allele was more commonly found in this population and appear to be over-transmitted compared to others known for their high rate of cervical cancer. Thus , the combination of relative low rate of HPV<pathogen> infection , over-transmission of protective genetic variant along with societal variables are the rationale behind the low incidence of cervical cancer in women in the region of western Asia. The influence of the genetic makeup of the patients has impact on personalized preventive medicine to gauge the risk of developing cervical cancer.
