  Guillain-Barr√© syndrome<disease> ( GBS) is a rare , autoimmune-mediated disease. The use of Bifidobacterium<pathogen> is reportedly effective in alleviating GBS since they act by regulating T helper ( Th) cells. In this study , we explored the differentiation of T helper cell subsets in patients with GBS. We also evaluated the effect of GBS on Bifidobacterium<pathogen> levels in patients and the likely protective influence of this bacterium<pathogen> in alleviating the disease in an animal model. We used flow cytometry , and real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) to determine the T cell subsets differentiation among 30 GBS patients and 20 healthy controls ( HC). The concentration of Bifidobacterium<pathogen> was assayed by real-time PCR. Experimental autoimmune neuritis ( EAN) animal model was established to support the protective role of Bifidobacterium<pathogen> in GBS. The expression of Th cells , Th2 and Th17 in the patients was significantly higher than that in the HC , while Treg cells decreased substantially. Moreover , the levels of Bifidobacterium<pathogen> in the GBS patients were considerably lower than those in the HC , the concentration of Bifidobacterium<pathogen> correlating with Th2 and Th17 subsets negatively. Treatment with Bifidobacterium<pathogen> significantly reduced the levels of Th2 and Th17 and promoted the levels of Treg cells. We concluded from this study that Bifidobacterium<pathogen> alleviated GBS by regulating Th cells , although in-depth studies might be required to fully understand the mechanism of action.
