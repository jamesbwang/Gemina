  Airborne transmission of H5N1<pathogen> highly pathogenic avian influenza<disease> ( HPAI) viruses<pathogen> has occurred among poultry and from poultry to humans during home or live-poultry market slaughter of infected poultry , and such transmission has been experimentally reproduced. In this study , we investigated simple , practical changes in the processing of H5N1<pathogen> virus-infected chickens to reduce infectious airborne particles and their transmission. Our findings suggest that containing the birds during the killing and bleeding first step by using a disposable plastic bag , a commonly available cooking pot widely used in Egypt ( halla) , or a bucket significantly reduces generation of infectious airborne particles and transmission to ferrets. Similarly , lack of infectious airborne particles was observed when processing vaccinated chickens that had been challenged with HPAI virus. Moreover , the use of a mechanical defeatherer significantly increased total number of particles in the air compared to manual defeathering. This study confirms that simple changes in poultry processing can efficiently mitigate generation of infectious airborne particles and their transmission to humans.
