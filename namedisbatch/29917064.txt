  Janus<pathogen> kinase ( JAK) inhibitors have shown efficacy in ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC). We studied the dose-response , efficacy , and safety of peficitinib , an oral JAK inhibitor , in patients with moderate-to-severe UC. In this Phase 2b , dose-ranging trial , we evaluated peficitinib at 25 mg once daily ( qd) , 75 mg qd , 150 mg qd , and 75 mg twice daily versus placebo for efficacy and safety in 219 patients with moderate-to-severe UC. The primary outcome was peficitinib dose-response at Week 8 with response assessed using Mayo score change from baseline. Secondary endpoints were clinical response , clinical remission , mucosal healing , change from baseline in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ( IBDQ) , and normalization of inflammatory biomarkers at Week 8; other secondary endpoints were treatment response through Week 16 and through Week 32 for patients in clinical response at Week 8. Safety was assessed through Week 36 or 4 weeks after the last dose. A statistically significant peficitinib dose-response was not demonstrated at Week 8 , although a numerically greater proportion of patients receiving peficitinib ≥ 75 mg qd achieved clinical response , remission , and mucosal healing at Week 8 , supported by IBDQ improvement and inflammatory biomarker normalization. Treatment-emergent adverse event ( TEAE) rates reported through Week 8 and the final safety visit were higher in the combined peficitinib group than placebo; patients receiving doses of ≥ 75 mg qd peficitinib reported TEAEs more frequently. While no dose-response in patients with moderate-to-severe UC was demonstrated with peficitinib , evidence of efficacy was suggested at doses ≥ 75 mg qd. The safety profile of peficitinib was consistent with current information. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01959282.
