  Urinary urge incontinence is a chronic , debilitating condition that is difficult to treat. Patients refractory to standard antimuscarinic therapy often experience recurrent urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> ( rUTIs). The microbiota of these refractory patients with rUTI remains unexplored. A midstream urine ( MSU) sample was collected from patients with refractory urge incontinence and coexistent rUTI during acute symptomatic episodes. Culture-based diagnosis was performed using routine microbiological methods. Culture-independent profiling was performed using bacterial 16S RNA profiling. E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strain typing was performed by amplicon pyrosequencing of the fimH gene. Over 2 years , 39 patients with refractory urge incontinence and coexistent rUTI were studied , yielding 9 severely affected cases. These 9 patients were carefully monitored for a further 2 years , resulting in the collection of 102 MSU samples , 70 of which were diagnosed as UTI ( median of 8 UTIs/woman). Culture-independent analysis of 38 of these samples revealed the existence of a diverse urinary microbiota. Strain typing of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> identified instances of rUTI caused by the same persisting strain and by new infecting strains. Patients with refractory urge incontinence and coexistent rUTI possess a diverse urinary microbiota , suggesting that persistent bladder colonisation might augment the pathology of their chronic condition.
