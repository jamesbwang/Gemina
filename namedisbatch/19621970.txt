  Human<pathogen> T-lymphotropic<pathogen> virus<pathogen> type II ( HTLV-II) is an important type-C retrovirus , closely related to a variety of human<disease> diseases<disease>. Here , we demonstrate for the first time the controllable fabrication of bio-bar codes for dendritically amplified sensing of low-abundant HTLV-II DNA by the integration of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( TdT)- catalyzed template-free polymerization extension with bio-bar-code amplification ( BCA). HTLV-II DNA hybridizes with magnetic microparticle ( MMP)- modified capture probe 1 , forming a stable DNA duplex with a protruding 3 '- hydroxylated sequence which may function as a primer to initiate the TdT-catalyzed first-step polymerization extension for the generation of a poly-thymidine ( T) sequence. The resultant poly-T products may hybridize with poly-adenine ( A) capture probe 2 , inducing the self-assembly of multiple capture probe 2-/ reporter probe-functionalized Au nanoparticles ( AuNPs) onto the MMP. Subsequently , the reporter probes may act as the primers to initiate the TdT-catalyzed second-step polymerization extension , producing large numbers of G-rich DNAzymes for the generation of an enhanced chemiluminescence signal. Taking advantage of the efficient polymerization extension reaction catalyzed by TdT , the high amplification efficiency of BCA , and the intrinsically high sensitivity of G-rich DNAzyme-driven chemiluminescence , this method exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity with a limit of detection of as low as 0.50 aM and a large dynamic range of 9 orders of magnitude from 1 aM to 1 nM. Moreover , this method can be applied for the discrimination of a single-base mismatch and the measurement of HTLV-II DNA in both human serum and human T-lymphocytic leukemia<disease> cells , holding great potential in biomedical research and clinical diagnosis.
