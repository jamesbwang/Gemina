  Campylobacter<pathogen> is an important agent of diarrhea<disease> in humans. In Ecuador , the information on Campylobacter<pathogen> is scarce and there are not antecedents about antimicrobial susceptibility. To describe Campylobacter<pathogen> prevalence in children with diarrhea<disease> and their behavior against five antimicrobials in vitro. We studied 253 children with diarrhea<disease> aging 7 months to 9 years who consulted for diarrhea<disease> in two hospitals in the city of Loja. Fecal samples were cultured and identification by tests by phenotypic tests and multiplex PCR. Susceptibility to 5 antibiotics was determined by the disc-diffusion method. Campylobacter<pathogen> was found in 16 ( 6.3 %) children , being C.<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen> the most frequent one ( 5.1 %) , followed by C.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( 1.2 %). All strains were susceptible to gentamicin and ampicillin/clavulanic acid , being found low resistance to ampicillin and erythromycin and high resistance to ciprofloxacin.
