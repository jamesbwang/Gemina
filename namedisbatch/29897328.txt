  Burkholderia<pathogen> cenocepacia<pathogen> is among the most common members of the Burkholderia<pathogen> cepacia<pathogen> complex ( Bcc) isolated from patients with cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF). The factors triggering the high rates of morbidity and mortality in CF patients are not well elucidated. In this study , we aim to highlight the genome diversity of two clinical isolates of B.<pathogen> cenocepacia<pathogen> through comparative genome analysis. The repertoire of virulence factors and resistance genes compared to reference strains J2315 and K56-2 was elucidated. The isolates were screened for the presence of phages and insertion sequences. Two methods were combined to obtain an accurate prediction of genomic islands ( GIs): the cumulative GC profile and the IslandViewer web tool. To study evolutionary relatedness , whole genome-based single-nucleotide polymorphism ( wgSNP) analysis was also performed with 43 publically available strains of the Bcc of various sequence types.Results/ Key findings. Genome-based species identification of the two isolates BC-AUH and BC-BMEH confirmed the species as B.<pathogen> cenocepacia<pathogen>. Both belonged to ST-602 , a double-locus variant of ST-32 ( CC31) , genomovar IIIA , and carried a large number of antibiotic resistance genes. Eighteen GIs were predicted in BC-AUH and BC-BMEH , occupying 9.3 and 6.1 % of the respective genomes. Comparison to J2315 revealed 89 and 85 genes unique to BC-BMEH and BC-AUH , respectively. Additionally , 1823 intergenic SNPs were detected between BC-BMEH and BC-AUH. This study mapped existing genetic variations in B.<pathogen> cenocepacia<pathogen> associated with notorious outcomes in CF patients , and the data obtained provide comprehensive , genome-inferred insights and multifactorial examination of an important human pathogen.
