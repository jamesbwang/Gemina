  Hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) genotype F1b infection is strongly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) in young Alaskan Native ( AN) people. However , the mechanisms by which genotype F1b causes HCC are unclear. Here , we analyzed the clinical and virological significance of genotype F1b in long-term serial samples from 20 HCC patients with HBV infection. Complete sequence analyses revealed that all isolates were genotype F1b. In the HCC patients , T1938C and A2051C mutations in the core region had accumulated significantly with A1762T/G1764A mutations in the basal core promoter ( BCP) region and G1896A mutation in the precore ( PC) region. Several HBV<pathogen> clones containing the core mutations were examined for their replication efficiency and core stability in vitro. Clones containing the A2051C mutation replicated more efficiently than the wild-type in association with enhanced stability of core protein dimerization. In chimeric mice with human hepatocytes carrying BCP/PC/2051 mutant , but not with wild-type virus , liver fibrosis<disease> was induced in association with high levels of serum HBV<pathogen> DNA and hepatitis<disease> B<disease> surface antigen. Interestingly , microarray analysis and validation study showed that five genes associated with cell proliferation or carcinogenesis , MYC ( v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog) , GAB2 ( Grb2-Associated Binding Protein 2) , BDKRB2 ( bradykinin receptor B2) , FST ( follistatin) and MAP3K8 ( mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8) , were significantly upregulated in human hepatocytes infected with genotype F1b , particularly the BCP/PC/2051 mutant , compared with other genotypes. We have identified a novel association between Alaska specific core mutations and HCC development in AN people infected with genotype F1b. Accumulation of these core mutations during the course of chronic<disease> infection<disease> with genotype F1b would contribute to HCC development in AN people earlier in life.
