  The water buffalo ( Bubalus bubalis) is important to the economy of several countries in Asia , and South America and there are also isolated herds in Europe. In India , buffalo is the main dairy animal. Coccidiosis due to Eimeria is an important cause of diarrhea<disease> in livestock worldwide. Eimeria species are generally considered host specific. More than 11 Eimeria species are considered common in buffaloes and cattle ( Bos taurus , Bos indicus<pathogen>). Of the numerous species of Eimeria in cattle , Eimeria bovis<pathogen> , Eimeria zuernii , Eimeria auburnensis and Eimeria alabamensis<pathogen> are considered pathogenic in cattle , but there is no report of their pathogenicity in naturally infected water buffaloes. Instead , Eimeria bareillyi has been documented to be the main pathogenic species in buffalo; it is not transmissible to cattle. There are many reports of Eimeria infections in water buffaloes , scattered in many local journals , and there are conflicting life cycle data on Eimeria species in buffalo. The objective of this paper is to summarize information on history , validity of Eimeria species , life cycle , pathogenicity , prevalence , epidemiology , diagnosis and control of coccidiosis in buffalo.
