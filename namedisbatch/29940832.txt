  Bone<disease> marrow ( BM) cytology and histopathology are complementary tools used to investigate hematological diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine if there are site-dependent differences in the diagnostic quality , myeloid to erythroid ratio ( MER) , and discordant findings in samples from different sites in the same dog. Eighteen apparently healthy dogs were used in the study. The sequence of sample acquisition was randomized according to a Latin square , and samples for BM cytology and histology were collected from both humeri and both ilial crests immediately after death. Board-certified clinical and anatomical pathologists read the cytology and histology , respectively. The data were analyzed using a mixed-effect model. The site of BM acquisition did not affect BM sample quality. The rate of discordant clinical findings between sites was 0.05 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.01-0.13). In general , by cytology , the MERs<pathogen> were slightly but significantly greater in samples from the ilial crests than from the humeri ( P = .01). The measured MER for histology was nearly twice that for cytology for all sites ( P < .001). In conclusion , there was a low-rate , site-dependent discordance in diagnostic findings in BM samples and differences in MER between the ilial crest and the humerus. A similar study is justified in sick dogs with hematological disease to determine the effect of sampling site on discordant findings between sites.
