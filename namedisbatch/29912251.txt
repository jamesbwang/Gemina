  Microorganisms isolated from blood cultures ( BC) in patients with febrile neutropenia ( NF) vary over time , requiring systematic monitoring to guide appropriate empirical therapy. To identify microorganisms isolated from BC and their antimicrobial resistance profile in children with cancer and high risk NF. Prospective , multicenter study. The analysis included episodes of high-risk FN with positive BC in children under 18 years of age treated in five hospitals in Santiago , Chile , 2012-2015. A total of 206 microorganisms were analyzed in 185 episodes of high-risk FN. The main isolates were Gram negative bacilli ( 46.6 %) and Gram positive cocci ( 45.1 %) and the most frequent microorganisms were Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( 22.8 %) , coagulase negative Staphylococcus<pathogen> ( 18.0 %) and Klebsiella<pathogen> spp. ( 16.5 %). Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and Klebsiella<pathogen> spp showed 4.2 % and 67.6 % resistance to third generation cephalosporins ( cefotaxime/ceftriaxone) , 10.6 % and 40.6 % resistance to fluoroquinolones<disease> ( ciprofloxacin) and 2.1 % and 26.5 % to amikacin , respectively. Coagulase negative Staphylococcus<pathogen> and Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> had 86.4 % and 22.2 % resistance to oxacillin , Streptococcus<pathogen> viridans<pathogen> group had 71 % resistance to penicillin. This study updates the etiology and resistance profile of microorganisms isolated in BC from children with cancer and high risk FN , an essential tool for the adequate management of these patients.
