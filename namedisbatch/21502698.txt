  In this study , we screened differentially expressed genes in a multidrug-resistant isolate strain of Clostridium<pathogen> perfringens<pathogen> by RNA sequencing. We also separated and identified differentially expressed proteins ( DEPs) in the isolate strain by two-dimensional electrophoresis ( 2-DE) and mass spectrometry ( MS). The RNA sequencing results showed that , compared with the control strain , 1128 genes were differentially expressed in the isolate strain , and these included 227 up-regulated genes and 901 down-regulated genes. Bioinformatics analysis identified the following genes and gene categories that are potentially involved in multidrug resistance ( MDR) in the isolate strain: drug transport , drug response , hydrolase activity , transmembrane transporter , transferase activity , amidase transmembrane transporter , efflux transmembrane transporter , bacterial chemotaxis , ABC transporter , and others. The results of the 2-DE showed that 70 proteins were differentially expressed in the isolate strain , 45 of which were up-regulated and 25 down-regulated. Twenty-seven DEPs were identified by MS and these included the following protein categories: ribosome , antimicrobial peptide resistance , and ABC transporter , all of which may be involved in MDR in the isolate strain of C.<pathogen> perfringens<disease>. The results provide reference data for further investigations on the drug resistant molecular mechanisms of
