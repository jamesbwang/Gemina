  Severe viral pneumonia<disease> is associated with a high mortality rate. However , due to the vulnerability of critically ill patients , invasive diagnostic methods should be performed with caution in the intensive care unit ( ICU). It would be helpful if the prevalence , risk factors , and clinical impact of virus detection are elucidated. We evaluated patients with severe pneumonia<disease> between January 1st 2008 and December 31st 2015. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) analysis was performed for 8 respiratory viruses when viral pathogen could not be excluded as the origin of severe pneumonia<disease> The baseline characteristics , laboratory results , microbiological findings , and clinical outcomes of the patients were analyzed. Of the 2,347 patients admitted to the medical ICU , 515 underwent RT-PCR for respiratory viruses , 69 of whom had positive results. The detection rate was higher during the winter , with a community onset , in patients with history of recent chemotherapy , and low platelet count. Additional bronchoscopic sampling along with upper respiratory specimen increased the yield of viral detection. Respiratory<pathogen> syncytial<pathogen> virus<pathogen> was the most common pathogen detected , while influenza<disease> A<pathogen> was the most common virus with bacterial coinfection. Respiratory<disease> virus<pathogen> detection led to changes in clinical management in one-third of the patients. The detection of viral pathogens in patients with severe pneumonia<disease> is not rare , and can be more common in certain group of patients. Invasive sampling for RT-PCR can be helpful , and such detection can lead to positive changes in clinical management.
