  P27A is an unstructured 104mer synthetic peptide from P.<pathogen> falciparum<disease> TEX1 blood-stage protein found to be the target of human antibodies inhibiting parasite growth. The present project aimed at evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of P27A peptide vaccine in malaria<disease> non-exposed European and exposed African adults. This study was designed as a staggered , fast track , randomized , antigen and adjuvant dose-finding , multi-center phase Ia/Ib trial , conducted in Switzerland and in Tanzania. P27A antigen ( 10 or 50μg) , adjuvanted with Alhydrogel ® or GLA-SE ( 2.5 or 5μg) , or control rabies<pathogen> vaccine ( Verorab ®) were administered intramuscularly to 16 malaria<disease> non-exposed and 40 exposed subjects on days 0 , 28 and 56. Local and systemic adverse events ( AEs) as well as humoral and cellular immune responses were assessed after each injection and during the 34-week follow-up. Most AEs were mild to moderate and resolved completely within 48 hours. Systemic AEs were more frequent in the formulation with Alum as compared to GLA-SE , whereas local AE were more frequent after GLA-SE. No serious AEs occurred. Supported by a mixed Th1/Th2 cell mediated immunity , P27A induced a marked specific antibody response able to recognize TEX1 in infected erythrocytes and to inhibit parasite growth through an ADCI dependent mechanism. Incidence of AEs and antibody responses were significantly lower in malaria-exposed Tanzanian than in non-exposed European subjects. The candidate vaccine P27A was safe and induced an immunogenic response that was particularly robust in combination with GLA-SE. This formulation should be considered for future efficacy trials. This trial was registered in clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01949909) and www.pactr.org ( PACTR201310000683408).
