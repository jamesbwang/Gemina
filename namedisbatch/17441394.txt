  Increasing use of different chemotherapy regimens , organ transplants , etc. , has led to the increasing number of neutropenic patients. Overall , 10 % of patients affected by cancer who are under treatment with anticancer drugs , regardless of the tumor type , are susceptible to febrile neutropenia. The study was performed to evaluate the frequency of bloodstream fungal infections in pediatric patients with febrile neutropenia in Sayed Al-Shohada Hospital ( Cancer Referral Center in Isfahan) in 2010-2012. This cross-sectional study was performed on pediatric patients with febrile neutropenia who were referred to Sayed Al-Shohada Hospital ( Cancer Referral Center in Isfahan) in 2010-2012. Blood samples were obtained from all the patients and were loaded into Bactec 9050 blood culture instruments ( Bectone Dickinson , Baltimore , Md. , USA) , and organisms responsible for causing fever<disease> were detected. Sixty-seven patients ( 51.3 males , 48.7 females) with a mean age of 12.3 Â± 15.8 years were included. The blood cultures of 48 patients ( 71.6 %) were negative. Seven samples of the isolates ( 10.4 %) were fungi<pathogen> , and twelve of them ( 18 %) were bacteria. Thus , the prevalence of fungal infection was 10.4 %. Due to the high relative prevalence of fungal infections in our study , it is necessary to take precautions for fungal infection prevention and choose the best way management to obtain optimal results in these patients.
