  The objective of the present paper was to review factors and conditions that are associated with hard and soft-tissue deficiencies at implant sites. Hard- and soft-tissue deficiencies at dental implants are common clinical findings. They can lead to complications and compromise implant survival and , hence , may require therapeutic interventions. It is , therefore , important to understand the etiology of hard and soft-tissue deficiencies. Based on this understanding , strategies should be developed to correct hard and soft-tissue deficiencies with the aim of improving clinical outcomes of implant therapy. A large number of etiological factors have been identified that may lead to hard and soft-tissue deficiencies. These factors include: 1) systemic<disease> diseases<disease> and conditions of the patients; 2) systemic medications; 3) processes of tissue healing; 4) tissue turnover and tissue response to clinical interventions; 5) trauma to orofacial structures; 6) local diseases affecting the teeth , the periodontium , the bone and the mucosa<pathogen>; 7) biomechanical factors; 8) tissue morphology and tissue phenotype; and 9) iatrogenic factors. These factors may appear as an isolated cause of hard and soft-tissue defects or may appear in conjunction with other factors. Hard- and soft-tissue deficiencies at implant sites may result from a multitude of factors. They encompass natural resorption processes following tooth extraction , trauma , infectious<disease> diseases<disease> such as periodontitis<disease> , peri-implantitis , endodontic<disease> infections<disease> , growth and development , expansion of the sinus floor , anatomical preconditions , mechanical overload , thin soft tissues , lack of keratinized mucosa<pathogen> , malpositioning of implants , migration of teeth , lifelong growth , and systemic<disease> diseases<disease>. When more than one factor leading to hard and/or soft-tissue deficiencies appear together , the severity of the resulting condition may increase. Efforts should be made to better identify the relative importance of these etiological factors , and to develop strategies to counteract their negative effects on our patient 's wellbeing.
