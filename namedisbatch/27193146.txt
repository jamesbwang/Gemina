  Despite decades of research into the human oral microbiome , many species remain uncultivated. The technique of single-cell whole-genome amplification and sequencing provides a means of deriving genome sequences for species that can be informative on biological function and suggest pathways to cultivation. Tannerella<pathogen> forsythia<pathogen> has long been known to be highly associated with chronic periodontitis<disease> and to cause periodontitis-like symptoms in experimental animals , and
