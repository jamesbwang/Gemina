  High rates of vaccination coverage are important in preventing infectious<disease> diseases<disease>. Enforcing mandatory vaccinations is one of the strategies that some Countries adopted to protect the community when vaccination coverage is not satisfactory. In Italy , in 2017 vaccination against diphtheria<disease> , tetanus<disease> , pertussis<disease> , hepatitis<disease> B<disease> , poliovirus<pathogen> , Haemophilus<pathogen> influenzae<pathogen> type b , measles<pathogen> , mumps<disease> , rubella<pathogen> and varicella became compulsory in childhood. In order to contrast vaccination policies , anti-vaccination campaigns contribute to the spread of fake news. Among them , there is the false information that Italy is the only one country with mandatory vaccination policy. Aim of our study is confronting vaccination policies in children under 18 months against among different European countries for the following vaccines: diphtheria<disease> , tetanus<disease> , pertussis<disease> , hepatitis<disease> B<disease> , poliovirus<pathogen> , Haemophilus<pathogen> influenzae<pathogen> type b , measles<pathogen> , mumps<disease> , rubella<pathogen> and varicella. Information on policies of mandatory or recommended vaccinations of the European Countries were gathered by ECDC and compared to the Italian one. European Countries recommend or contemplate compulsory vaccines. Among them , eleven Countries ( 35.4 %) have mandatory vaccinations for at least one out of diphtheria<disease> , tetanus<disease> , pertussis<disease> , hepatitis<disease> B<disease> , poliovirus<pathogen> , Haemophilus<pathogen> influenzae<pathogen> type b , measles<pathogen> , mumps<disease> , rubella<pathogen> and varicella vaccine. Not only in Italy , vaccination against diphtheria<disease> , tetanus<disease> , pertussis<disease> , hepatitis<disease> B<disease> , poliovirus<pathogen> , Haemophilus<pathogen> influenzae<pathogen> type b , measles<pathogen> , mumps<disease> , rubella<pathogen> and varicella is mandatory in children under 18 months. Other European countries adopted compulsory policies in order to prevent the spread of infectious<disease> diseases<disease> and to protect the community.
