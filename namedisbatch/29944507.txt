  To report the first case of fungal keratitis<disease> caused by Cryptococcus<pathogen> curvatus<pathogen> after penetrating keratoplasty ( PK) in an immunocompetent patient and to describe its therapeutic challenge and long-term outcome. An interventional case report. A 54-year-old female patient underwent right PK for lattice dystrophy. At 5-year post-PK , she developed a polymicrobial keratitis<disease> caused by Candida<pathogen> parapsilosis<pathogen> , and Stenotrophomonas<pathogen> maltophilia<pathogen> at the peripheral graft , which was successfully treated with topical antibiotic and antifungal drops. One year later , another fungal keratitis<disease> occurred which apparently resolved with antifungal treatment but recurred in an unusual fashion and required a repeat PK revealing the diagnosis of C.<pathogen> curvatus<pathogen> keratitis<disease>. This was confirmed by microbiological culture on Sabouraud dextrose agar , nuclear ribosomal repeat regional sequencing of the D1-D2 and internal transcribed spacer regions , and histopathological examination. Various topical , intracorneal , and systemic antifungal treatments had been attempted but failed to resolve the infection completely , necessitating a subsequent third PK. A further recurrence was noted 16-month post-third PK , which was eradicated with multiple topical and intracorneal antifungal treatment , and direct cryotherapy to the corneal abscess<disease> No further recurrence of C.<pathogen> curvatus<pathogen> was noted at 4-year follow-up. Cryptococcus<pathogen> curvatus<pathogen> should be added to the known list of organisms capable of causing fungal keratitis<disease> Our experience suggests that this type of organism could cause low-grade , grumbling infection , which may however be exceptionally difficult to treat. Long-term eradication of this rare fungal keratitis<disease> could be potentially achieved by intensive ocular and systemic antifungal treatment , repeat therapeutic keratoplasties , and focal cryotherapy.
