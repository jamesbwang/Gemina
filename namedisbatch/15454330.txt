  Rabies<pathogen> is a fatal encephalitis<disease> caused by lyssaviruses , with most human cases worldwide resulting from rabid dog bites. Although effective animal and human vaccines have been available for over 100 years , control efforts have not been adequately implemented on the global scale and rabies<pathogen> remains one of the greatest global zoonotic threats to human health. We conducted a knowledge , attitudes and practices survey in Northern Cameroon to describe dog ownership characteristics , rates of dog bites , and post-bite healthcare seeking behaviors. The survey was performed in four rural Cameroonian communities. A structured community-based questionnaire was conducted over a 20-day period in April 2010 , and focused on socio-economic factors correlated with gaps in rabies<pathogen> knowledge. Information pertaining to socio-demographics , as well as attitudes and practices with regard to animal bites and bite treatment practices were recorded. Characteristics of dog ownership such as dog confinement , resources provided to dogs , and dog vaccination status were examined. Human to dog ratios were compared on a linear scale to poverty scores by community. When applicable , 2-tailed Chi-square tests or Fisher 's exact tests were calculated to determine relationships between variables. We also used One-way Analysis of Variance ( ANOVA) to identify associations between rabies<pathogen> knowledge and wealth with dog ownership , dog vaccination , and human healthcare seeking behaviors. Independent variables were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 208 households were enrolled. Respondents were predominantly male ( 68.3 %) , with a median age of 43.6 years. Eighty-four households ( 39.9 %) reported owning a total of 141 dogs ( human dog ratio 10.4:1). The majority of dogs ( 61 %) were allowed to roam freely. A history of rabies<pathogen> vaccination was reported for 30.8 % of owned dogs. Respondents reported 11 bites during the two years preceding the survey ( annual bite incidence was 2.6 % ( 95 % CI 1.4 %- 4.6 %)). Only one person ( 9.1 %) received rabies<pathogen> post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP) , and none described symptoms of clinical illness consistent with rabies<pathogen>. Respondents who indicated that they would seek medical care and PEP after a dog bite had higher average wealth and rabies<pathogen> knowledge index scores ( p = 0.01 and 0.04 , respectively). Respondents who indicated that they would seek care from a traditional healer had significantly lower wealth scores , but not significantly different knowledge scores ( p < 0.01 and p = 0.49 , respectively). In the communities evaluated , the majority of dogs were allowed to roam freely and had no history of rabies<pathogen> vaccination; factors that favor enzootic transmission of canine rabies<pathogen> virus. We also identified a strong relationship between poverty and dog ownership. Bite events were relatively common among respondents , and very few victims reported utilizing health services to treat wounds<disease> Increased wealth and knowledge were significantly associated with increased likelihood that a respondent would seek medical care and post-exposure prophylaxis. These findings indicate the need for educational outreach to raise awareness of dog rabies<pathogen> and proper prevention measures.
