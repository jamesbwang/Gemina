  Asparagus racemosus<pathogen> ( Shatavari) , belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is known as a `` curer of hundred diseases '' since ancient time. This plant has been exploited as a food supplement to enhance immune system and regarded as a highly valued medicinal plant in Ayurvedic medicine system for the treatment of various ailments such as gastric ulcers<disease> , dyspepsia , cardiovascular diseases , neurodegenerative diseases , cancer , as a galactogogue and against several other diseases. In depth metabolic fingerprinting of various parts of the plant led to the identification of 13 monoterpenoids exclusively present in roots. LC-MS profiling led to the identification of a significant number of steroidal saponins ( 33). However , we have also identified 16 triterpene saponins for the first time in A. racemosus<pathogen>. In order to understand the molecular basis of biosynthesis of major components , transcriptome sequencing from three different tissues ( root , leaf and fruit) was carried out. Functional annotation of A. racemosus<pathogen> transcriptome resulted in the identification of 153 transcripts involved in steroidal saponin biosynthesis , 45 transcripts in triterpene saponin biosynthesis , 44 transcripts in monoterpenoid biosynthesis and 79 transcripts in flavonoid biosynthesis. These findings will pave the way for better understanding of the molecular basis of steroidal saponin , triterpene saponin , monoterpenoids and flavonoid biosynthesis in A.
