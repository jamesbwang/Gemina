  Central nervous system ( CNS) viral<disease> infections<disease> are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. No data are available regarding their epidemiology in Qatar. We retrospectively evaluated all cerebrospinal fluid findings from January 2011-March 2015 at Hamad Medical Corporation. Those with abnormal CSF finding were included in our study. We excluded those with missing medical records , no clinical evidence of viral CNS infection , or proven bacterial , fungal or tuberculosis<disease> CNS infection. CNS clinical findings were classified as meningitis<disease> , encephalitis<disease> or myelitis. Among 7690 patients with available CSF results , 550 cases met the inclusion criteria ( meningitis<disease> 74.7 %; encephalitis<disease> 25 %; myelitis 0.4 %). Two-thirds ( 65 %) were male and 50 % were between 16-60 years old. Viral etiology was confirmed in 38 % ( enterovirus<pathogen> , 44.3 %; Epstein-Barr virus , 31 %; varicella zoster<disease> virus , 12.4 %). The estimated incidence was 6.4 per 100,000 population. Two persons died and the rest were discharged to home. Among those with confirmed viral etiology , 83.8 % received ceftriaxone ( mean duration 7.3 ± 5.2 days) , 38 % received vancomycin ( mean duration 2.7 ± 5.4 days) and 38 % received at least one other antibiotic. Intravenous acyclovir was continued for more than 48h in patients with confirmed negative viral etiology ( mean duration 5 ± 5.6 days). Viral etiology is not uncommon among those evaluated for CNS infection in Qatar. Clinical outcomes are excellent in this group of patients. Antibiotics and acyclovir are overly used even when a viral etiology is confirmed. There is a need for clinician education regarding etiology and treatment of viral CNS infections.
