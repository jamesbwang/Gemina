  The average expenditure incurred by patients in low- and middle-income countries towards diagnosis and treatment of TB ranges from $ 55 to $ 8198. This out-of-pocket expenditure leads to impoverishment of households. One of the three main targets of the End TB Strategy ( 2016-2035) is that no TB-affected household suffers catastrophic costs due to TB. Study setting was free care under national tuberculosis<disease> program ( NTP) , Puducherry district , India. The objectives of the study were among the newly diagnosed and previously treated tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) patients , to ( a) estimate patient costs during diagnosis and intensive phase of treatment , ( b) determine the proportion of households experiencing catastrophic costs , and ( c) explore coping strategies. An explanatory mixed methods design comprising both quantitative cost description and qualitative descriptive component was used. Catastrophic cost was defined as total TB care costs exceeding 20 % of annual household income. Of 102 TB patients included , two-thirds ( 69 %) were male , 6 % were HIV<pathogen> positive , and 45 % reported at least one episode of hospitalization for TB care. The median ( IQR) total cost of TB care was US$ 195 ( 52.1 , 492.9) with a direct cost of US$ 65.3 ( 22.3 , 156.5) and indirect cost of US$ 50.2 ( 0.9 , 295.1). Overall , 32.4 % of households experienced catastrophic costs due to TB care , significantly higher in patients with HIV<pathogen> coinfection ( p = 0.009) and hospitalization ( p = 0.009). Pledging jewels and borrowing money were major coping strategies. Cash assistance was the expected remedy from the patient perspective. Despite free TB care under NTP , more than a third incurred catastrophic costs towards TB care.
