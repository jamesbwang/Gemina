  AIMS To determine which of the common canine respiratory pathogens circulate among selected populations of healthy and diseased dogs in New Zealand. METHODS Coagulated blood samples for serology and oropharyngeal<disease> swabs for virology were collected from healthy dogs ( n = 47) and from dogs with acute<disease> respiratory<disease> disease<disease> ( n = 49). For diseased dogs a convalescent blood sample was also collected 3-4 weeks later. Oropharyngeal<disease> swabs were subjected to virus isolation and tested for canine parainfluenza virus ( CPIV) , canine adenovirus<pathogen> ( CAdV) 2 , canine herpesvirus<pathogen> ( CHV) , canine respiratory<pathogen> coronavirus<pathogen> ( CRCoV) , canine influenza<disease> virus<pathogen> ( CIV) , canine distemper virus ( CDV) , Bordetella<pathogen> bronchiseptica<pathogen> , Streptococcus<pathogen> equi<pathogen> subsp. zooepidemicus<pathogen> , and Mycoplasma<pathogen> cynos nucleic acids by quantitative PCR ( qPCR). Sera were tested for CRCoV antibody using competitive ELISA and results expressed as percent of inhibition ( POI). RESULTS The mean age of diseased dogs ( 2.7 , min < 0.5 , max 8.5 years) was lower than the mean age of healthy dogs ( 5.3 , min < 0.5 , max 17 years) ( p < 0.001). In total , 20/94 ( 21 %) dogs were positive for at least one agent by qPCR. Diseased dogs were most commonly positive for M. cynos ( 8/47 , 17 %) , followed by CPIV ( 3/47 , 6 %) and B.<pathogen> bronchiseptica<pathogen> ( 3/47 , 6 %) , while healthy dogs were most commonly positive for CAdV-2 ( 6/47 , 13 %) , followed by M. cynos ( 2/47 , 4 %). All samples were negative for CIV , CRCoV , CDV and S.<pathogen> equi<pathogen> subsp. zooepidemicus<pathogen>. Viruses were not isolated from any of the samples tested. In total , 47/93 ( 50 %) dogs were seropositive for CRCoV on at least one sampling occasion. Samples from diseased dogs were more frequently seropositive for CRCoV , with higher POI , than samples from healthy dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE We showed that CAdV-2 , CPIV , CHV , CRCoV , B.<pathogen> bronchiseptica<pathogen> and M. cynos circulated among sampled dogs. The convenience sampling methodology , with a poor match between the populations of diseased and healthy dogs in terms of age , breed and use , together with the relatively small sample size precluded inference of any causal relationships between infection with a given pathogen and development of disease. None-the-less , our data suggest that further investigation into epidemiology and disease association of CRCoV and M. cynos is warranted. In addition , circulation of novel respiratory pathogens among dogs in New Zealand should be considered in future studies , as 70/94 ( 74 %) diseased dogs were negative for all the pathogens tested.
