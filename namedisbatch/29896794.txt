  It is currently unclear what impact serum microRNA-122 ( miR-122) levels have on clearance of hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) surface antigen ( HBsAg) in HBV-infected patients who had not received antiviral therapy. The current study evaluated the impact of serum miR-122 levels on HBsAg seroclearance in 367 consecutive HBV-infected patients who had not received antiviral therapy between their initial and last visit , and investigated the predictive factors of HBsAg seroclearance. Cumulative HBsAg seroclearance rates were 13.5 % , 32.0 % , and 37.4 % after 10 , 20 , and 30 years , respectively. The yearly incidence of HBsAg seroclearance over the investigated 30-year period was 1.25 %. A significant and strong correlation was observed between serum miR-122 and HBsAg levels. Moreover , there was a significant correlation between serum miR-122 levels and the levels of HBV<pathogen> DNA , hepatitis<disease> B<disease> e-antigen , and HBV<pathogen> core-related antigen. The HBsAg seroclearance rate in patients with a < 1.0-fold change of serum miR-122 levels was significantly higher than in those with a ≥ 1.0-fold change. Multivariate analysis identified age ( ≥ 30 years) , HBV<pathogen> DNA levels ( < 2.2 log U/mL) , HBV genotype ( non-C) , and serum miR-122 levels ( < 1.0-fold change) as significant predictors of HBsAg seroclearance. Our results indicated that serum miR-122 level is an important predictor of HBsAg seroclearance in Japanese patients who do not receive antiviral therapy. Understanding the complexity of the interactions among various virus-related and host-related factors could potentially help in the design of new therapies that enhance HBsAg seroclearance.
