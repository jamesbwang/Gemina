  Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> is the leading cause of neonatal Gram-negative bacterial meningitis<disease> , but the pathogenesis of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> meningitis<disease> remains elusive. E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> penetration of the blood-brain barrier ( BBB) is the critical step for development of meningitis<disease> Here , we identify Caspr1 , a single-pass transmembrane protein , as a host receptor for E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> virulence factor IbeA to facilitate BBB penetration. Genetic ablation of endothelial Caspr1 and blocking IbeA-Caspr1 interaction effectively prevent E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> penetration into the brain during meningitis<disease> in rodents. IbeA interacts with extracellular domain of Caspr1 to activate focal adhesion kinase signaling causing E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> internalization into the brain endothelial cells of BBB. E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> can invade hippocampal neurons causing apoptosis dependent on IbeA-Caspr1 interaction. Our results indicate that E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> exploits Caspr1 as a host receptor for penetration of BBB resulting in meningitis<disease> , and that Caspr1 might be a useful target for prevention or therapy of
