  New composites based on Ca-alginate hydrogels were produced that release activated charcoal ( AC) particles with adsorbed povidone iodine ( PVP-I) as a model antimicrobial substance in a physiological-like environment. Composite beads with different alginate ( 0.5-1.5 % w/w) and AC ( 1-20 % w/w) concentrations were analyzed by FE-SEM and characterized regarding textural parameters , swelling , and AC release kinetics. PVP-I was easily adsorbed onto AC particles within the optimized beads ( 0.5 % w/w alginate , 20 % w/w AC) as indicated by UV-vis spectroscopy , EDX and FT-IR analyses. The obtained beads have shown strong bactericidal effects against two standard bacterial strains ( Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> and clinical multi-resistant wound<disease> isolates ( MRSA , Escherichia<pathogen> coli , Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> , Ð•nterococcus faecalis<pathogen> and Proteus<pathogen> mirabilis<pathogen> and , at the same time , exhibited negligible PVP-I desorption in physiological saline solution. Thus , the obtained composites could provide utilization of potent antiseptics such as iodine , in wound<disease> dressings , without the concern of systemic absorption.
