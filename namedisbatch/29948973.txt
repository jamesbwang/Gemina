  To assess the impact of bloodstream infection ( BSI) in patients with head and neck cancer ( HNC) in the cetuximab era. We prospectively analysed the epidemiology , microbiology and outcomes of 51 BSI episodes occurring in 48 patients with HNC ( 2006-2017). We performed a retrospective matched-cohort study ( 1:2) to determine the risk factors for BSI. Finally , we compared patients who died with those who survived to identify risk factors for mortality. The most frequent HNC localization was the oropharynx ( 43 %) , and pneumonia<disease> was the most frequent source ( 25 %). Gram-positive BSI occurred in 55 % cases , mainly due to Streptococcus<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> ( 21 %) , and among Gram-negatives , Escherichia<pathogen> coli , Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> , and Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> were the most frequent. Hypoalbuminemia ( OR 8.4; 95 % CI , 3.5-19.9) , previous chemotherapy ( OR , 3.2; 95 % CI , 1.3-7.4) and cetuximab therapy ( OR , 2.8; 95 % CI , 1.6-6.7) were significant risk factors for BSI. Patients with BSI had a higher overall case-fatality rate than patients without BSI ( OR , 4.4; 95 % CI , 1.7-11.8). Hypoalbuminemia was an independent risk factor for the early ( 7 day) and overall ( 30 day) case-fatalities , with ORs of 0.8 ( 95 % CI , 0.6-0.9) and 0.8 ( 95 % CI , 0.7-0.97) , respectively. The presence of comorbidities ( OR , 7; 95 % CI , 1.4-34) was also an independent risk factor for overall case-fatality. BSI causes high mortality in patients with HNC and is most often secondary to pneumonia<disease> It occurs mainly among patients with hypoalbuminemia who receive treatment with cetuximab or chemotherapy. The development of BSI in patients with HNC impairs their outcome , especially in the presence of hypoalbuminemia and comorbidities.
