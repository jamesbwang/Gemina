  Genome engineering with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR) system can be used as a tool to correct pathological mutations or modulate gene expression levels associated with pathogenesis of human<disease> diseases<disease>. Owing to well-established local administration methods including intravitreal and subretinal injection , it is relatively easy to administer therapeutic genome engineering machinery to ocular tissues for treating retinal diseases. In this context , we have investigated the potential of in vivo genome engineering as a therapeutic approach in the form of ribonucleoprotein or CRISPR packaged in viral vectors. Major issues in therapeutic application of genome engineering include specificity and efficacy according to types of CRISPR system. In addition to previous platforms based on ribonucleoprotein and CRISPRassociated protein 9 derived from Campylobacter<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen> , we evaluated the therapeutic effects of a CRISPR RNA-guided endonuclease derived from Lachnospiraceae bacterium<pathogen> ND2006 ( LbCpf1) in regulating pathological angiogenesis in an animal model of wet-type age-related macular degeneration. LbCpf1 targeting Vegfa or Hif1a effectively disrupted the expression of genes in ocular tissues , resulting in suppression of choroidal neovascularization. It was also notable that there were no significant off-target effects in vivo. ( BMB Reports 2018; 51 ( 7): 315-316).
