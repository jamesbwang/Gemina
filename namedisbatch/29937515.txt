  Hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> is a hepatotropic virus that is transmitted parenterally. Viral<disease> infections<disease> are usually associated with modulations of the immune cells , leading to enhanced viral survival and spreading , and accordingly , life-threatening complications. Recently , it has been proposed that a new subset of T-helper , named T-helper 9 , is involved in the pathogenesis of different immunopathological conditions , such as allergies , tumors , and viral<disease> infections<disease>. Some studies reported a protective role , and others described a pathogenic potential for the T-helper 9 cells. Here , we present evidence that T-helper 9 cells are dynamically increased with increasing the pathogenic strategy for hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>). Furthermore , viral clearance is associated with a decrease in T-helper 9. The increase in T-helper 9 was paralleled with an increase in its receptor expression. Taken together , our data suggest that T-helper 9 cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of HCV<pathogen> , and is directly associated with HCV-related complications.
