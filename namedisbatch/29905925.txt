  A 36-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit due to diabetic ketoacidosis and pneumonia<disease> requiring mechanical ventilation. Three weeks after admission , he developed a refractory bacteremia with Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> carbapenemase-producing bacteria ( KPC). He remained febrile and with bacteremia for six weeks despite therapy with polymyxin B , carbapenems , and amikacin. Imaging studies looking for deep-seated infection revealed vertebral L1-L2 diskitis and osteomyelitis<disease> with pre-vertebral abscess<disease> and bilateral psoas pyomyositis that were not amenable for drainage. In view of the refractory infection and the activity against KPC described in the literature , we decided to switch the patient to ceftazidime/avibactam. After six weeks of therapy , there was complete resolution of the infectious processes. We present an instance of clinical success with ceftazidime/avibactam for the treatment of refractory KPC bacteremia , vertebral diskitis and osteomyelitis<disease> with pre-vertebral abscess<disease> and bilateral psoas pyomyositis. This experience serves as reference to support treatment with ceftazidime/avibactam in similar complicated cases.
