  Nitrification is important in nitrogen ( N) cycling of aquatic environments , but knowledge about its regulation and importance is sparse. Here we examined nitrification and ammonia<pathogen> oxidizers in the Baltic Sea. We investigated two sites with different catchment characteristics ( agricultural and forest<disease>) , the Bay of Gdánsk ( south) and the Öre Estuary ( north) , and measured pelagic nitrification rates and abundance , composition , and expression of ammonia<pathogen> monooxygenase ( amoA) genes. Highest nitrification rates were found in the nutrient rich Bay of Gdańsk. Interestingly , abundances of ammonia-oxidizing archaea ( AOA) and bacteria ( AOB) were orders of magnitude lower than reported from other sites. Although AOA were most abundant at both sites , the highest expression levels were from AOB. Interestingly , few AOA and AOB taxa dominated amoA gene expression , with a Nitrosomarinus related phylotype showing widespread expression. AOA and AOB communities differed between sites and depths , respectively , with the composition in rivers being distinct. A storm event , causing an even depth distribution of nitrification and particles in the Bay of Gdańsk , indicated that the presence of particles stimulate nitrification. The study highlights coastal regions as dynamic sites of extensive pelagic nitrification , which may affect local food web dynamics and loss of N mediated by denitrification.
