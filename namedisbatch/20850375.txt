  A series of novel 4-thiazolidinone inhibitors SKYa-SKYg , containing coumarin as a core structure were synthesized via facile and efficient method. The structures of the synthesized compounds were established by extensive spectroscopic studies ( FT IR , 1D NMR , 2D NMR , LC-MS) and elemental analysis. All the synthesized hybrids were further evaluated for their potential as anti-tubercular agents against Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> H37Rv<pathogen> ATCC 25618 , and anti-bacterial agents against Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , Enterobacter<pathogen> aerogenes<pathogen> , Salmonella<disease> typhi<disease> , Streptococcus<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> and Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> Interestingly , the hybrids displayed potent bioactivity. However , compounds SKYc , SKYd , and SKYe appeared to be more effective against the tested bacterial strains , among which compound SKYb showed the highest inhibition against all the bacterial strains ranging from 41 to 165 μg/mL , as compared to the standards , streptomycin , kanamycin and vancomycin. Moreover , derivative SKYa was found to be the strongest against M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> ( 83 μg/mL). Additionally , the anti-dengue potential of the coumarin hybrids as two-component NS2B/NS3 DENV<pathogen> flavivirus<pathogen> serine protease inhibitors was calculated using computational molecular docking approach , with reference to the standards 4-hydroxypanduratin , panduratin and ethyl 3- ( 4- ( hydroxymethyl) -2-methoxy-5-nitrophenoxy) propanoate with DS of- 3.379 ,- 3.189 and- 3.381 , respectively. The docking results revealed that the synthesized hybrids exhibited potent anti-dengue activity among which compounds SKYf , SKYd , SKYc and SKYe were found to be the best ones with docking scores of- 4.014 ,- 3.964 ,- 3.905 and- 3.889. In summary , we discovered 4-thiazolidinone coumarin derivatives as a new scaffold that may eventually yield useful compounds in the treatment of bacterial and
