  Chronic clinical Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> ( T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen>) infection is the primary<disease> disease<disease> state that causes severe encephalitis<disease>. CD44 is a member of the cell adhesion molecule family and plays an important role in T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> infection. However , proteomic changes in CD44 during chronic T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> infection have rarely been reported. Thus , an iTRAQ-based proteomic study coupled with 2D-LC-MS/MS analysis was performed to screen CD44-related proteins during chronic T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> infection. As a result , a total of 2612 proteins were reliably identified and quantified. Subsequently , 259 , 106 , and 249 differentially expressed proteins ( DEPs) were compared between CD44- mice ( A) vs wild-type mice ( B) , B vs wild-type mice infected with T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> ( C) , and C vs CD44- mice infected with T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> ( D). Gene ontology , KEGG pathway , and protein-protein interaction analyses were performed on the DEPs. According to the results , immune-related proteins were altered significantly among the A vs B , B vs C , and C vs D comparisons , which might indicate that chronic T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> infection caused changes in the host immune response. Additionally , Ca
