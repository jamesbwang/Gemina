  The Avian Influenza<disease> A<pathogen> ( H5N1<pathogen>) virus<pathogen> is endemic in poultry in Egypt. The winter of 2014/2015 was particularly worrying as new clusters of HPAI A ( H5N1<pathogen>) virus<pathogen> emerged , leading to an important number of AI A ( H5N1<pathogen>) outbreaks in poultry farms and sporadic human cases. To date , few studies have investigated the distribution of HPAI A ( H5N1<pathogen>) outbreaks in Egypt in relation to protective/ risk factors at the farm level , a gap we intend to fill. The aim of the study was to analyse passive surveillance data that were based on observation of sudden and high mortality of poultry or drop in duck or chicken egg production , as a basis to better understand and discuss the risk of HPAI A ( H5N1<pathogen>) presence at the farm level in large parts of the Nile Delta. The probability of HPAI A ( H5N1<pathogen>) presence was associated with several characteristics of the farms. Vaccination status , absence of windows/openings in the farm and the number of birds per cycle of production were found to be protective factors , whereas the presence of a duck farm with significant mortality or drop in egg production in the village was found to be a risk factor. Results demonstrate the key role of several prevention and biosecurity measures to reduce HPAI A ( H5N1<pathogen>) virus<pathogen> circulation , which could promote better poultry farm biosecurity in Egypt.
