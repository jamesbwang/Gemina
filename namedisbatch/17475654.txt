  Occult hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection ( OCI) , first described in 2004 , is defined as the presence of HCV<pathogen> RNA in hepatocytes or peripheral blood mononuclear cells without detectable HCV<pathogen> RNA in the serum. Here , we aimed to review the epidemiology , diagnostic methods , clinical implications and potential management recommendations currently described in the literature , as well as the future directions for investigation of this entity. PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched with combination of the following keywords: `` occult '' , `` hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> '' , and `` occult HCV<pathogen> infection ''. There are data to support OCI as a potential culprit in cryptogenic liver disease. There are also consistent data demonstrating the existence of OCI in specific populations , such as dialysis , human immunodeficiency virus-infected and hepatitis<disease> B<disease> virus-infected patients , and also in the general population. While the gold standard for diagnosis is liver biopsy , examination of peripheral blood mononuclear cells may be a reliable , safer alternative method of diagnosis. Occult HCV<pathogen> infection is likely associated with liver fibrosis<disease> and progression of liver disease. Additional studies are required to determine the infectivity of OCI patients , as well as clarify the natural course and specific clinical implications of OCI. Lastly , studies are needed to determine whether treatment of OCI leads to decreased morbidity and/or mortality.
