  Artemisia capillaris ( Yin-Chen) is a famous traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM) for treating acute and chronic hepatitis<disease> in China. Enynes are one type of characteristic constituents in this herb , while their anti-hepatitis B virus<pathogen> ( anti-HBV) properties have not been systemically investigated. This study is to reveal the active part of A. capillaris , and systemically investigate the enynes and their anti-HBV activity. The total extract and each fraction of A. capillaris were assayed for the anti-HBV activity to reveal the active part. Bioassay-guided fractionation using various chromatographic techniques yielded the enynes , whose structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analyses and ECD calculations. The anti-HBV properties inhibiting HBsAg and HBeAg secretions and HBV<pathogen> DNA replication were evaluated on HepG 2.2.15 cell line in vitro. ACT-2 and ACT-3 was revealed to be the respective active and toxic part of A. capillaris. Twelve enynes ( 1-12) involving four new ones ( 1-4) and two unusual enyne analogs ( 13-14) were isolated from the active part ( ACT-2). All the isolates were assayed for their anti-HBV activity , and the preliminary structure-activity relationships were summarized based on the structural features. In particular , compound 4 could significantly inhibit the secretions of HBsAg and HBeAg , and HBV<pathogen> DNA replication with IC Enynes are responsible for the anti-HBV effects of A. capillaris. Hydroxyl and glycosyl groups are preferable for maintaining activity. This is the first time to systematically investigate the anti-HBV activity of enynes in A. capillaris , which provides valuable information for understanding the ethnopharmacological application of Yin-Chen.
