  Mass drug administrations ( MDAs) are part of the World Health Organization 's Plasmodium<pathogen> falciparum<pathogen> elimination strategy for the Greater Mekong Subregion ( GMS). In Cambodia , a 2015-2017 clinical trial evaluated the effectiveness of MDA. This article explores factors that influence the feasibility and acceptability of MDA , including seasonal timing , financial incentives and the delivery model. Quantitative data were collected through structured questionnaires from the heads of 163 households. Qualitative data were collected through 25 semi-structured interviews and 5 focus group discussions with villagers and local health staff. Calendars of village activities were created and meteorological and malaria<disease> treatment records were collected. MDA delivered house-to-house or at a central point , with or without compensation , were equally acceptable and did not affect coverage. People who knew about the rationale for the MDA , asymptomatic infections and transmission were more likely to participate. In western Cambodia , MDA delivered house-to-house by volunteers at the end of the dry season may be most practicable but requires the subsequent treatment of in-migrants to prevent reintroduction of infections. For MDA targeted at individual villages or village clusters it is important to understand local preferences for community mobilisation , delivery and timing , as several models of MDA are feasible.
