  This study aims to estimate the prevalence of hepatitis<disease> B<disease> ( HBV<pathogen>) and C ( HCV<pathogen>) in the population through field-screening camps conducted by Chennai Liver Foundation , in the southern state of Tamil Nadu , India. This is the largest population-based study from Tamil Nadu. A total of 75 camps were conducted across 14 districts of Tamil Nadu ( 2014-2017). Screening was done by rapid point-of-care assays ( SD-bioline tests) and confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( Monolisa tests). Those tested negative were offered first dose of HBV<pathogen> vaccine. Positive patients with HBV count of more than 2000 IU/ml or HCV-RNA positive on quantitative analysis were treated. A total of 18589 people were screened , with HBV infection detected in 303 ( prevalence 1.63 %) and HCV<pathogen> infection in 56 ( prevalence 0.3 %) , with significant variation among districts. Males contributed to about three-fourths of detected HBV<pathogen> ( 233/303 ( 77 %)) or HCV<pathogen> ( 41/56 ( 73 %)) infection. Screening detected a higher overall HBV/HCV infection rate in rural ( 203 ( 2.52 %) infections in 8047 people) than in urban ( 156 ( 1.47 %) infections in 10542 people) areas ( P < 0.0001). Slum areas had a HBV prevalence of 5 %. In a dialysis unit , all patients were found to have either HBV/HCV infection. A total of 162/303 ( 54 %) people with HBV and 27/56 ( 48 %) with HCV<pathogen> infection were treated , and 7704 people received the first dose of HBV<pathogen> vaccine. The prevalence of HBV was 1.63 % and HCV<pathogen> was 0.30 % in Tamil Nadu. Three-fourths of HBV/HCV infected people were males. Prevalence of HBV/HCV was higher in rural areas. Slum area and dialysis unit had high HBV and HCV<pathogen> prevalence.
