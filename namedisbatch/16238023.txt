  Urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> ( UTIs<disease>) are among the most common infections in humans , predominantly caused by uropathogenic Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( UPEC). The diverse genomes of UPEC strains mostly impede disease prevention and control measures. In this study , we comparatively analyzed the whole genome sequence of a highly virulent UPEC strain , namely UPEC 26-1 , which was isolated from urine sample of a patient suffering from UTI in Korea. Whole genome analysis showed that the genome consists of one circular chromosome of 5,329,753 bp , comprising 5064 protein-coding genes , 122 RNA genes ( 94 tRNA , 22 rRNA and 6 ncRNA genes) , and 100 pseudogenes , with an average G+C content of 50.56 %. In addition , we identified 8 prophage regions comprising 5 intact , 2 incomplete and 1 questionable ones and 63 genomic islands , suggesting the possibility of horizontal gene transfer in this strain. Comparative genome analysis of UPEC 26-1 with the UPEC strain CFT073<pathogen> revealed an average nucleotide identity of 99.7 %. The genome comparison with CFT073<pathogen> provides major differences in the genome of UPEC 26-1 that would explain its increased virulence and biofilm formation. Nineteen of the total GIs were unique to UPEC 26-1 compared to CFT073<pathogen> and nine of them harbored unique genes that are involved in virulence , multidrug resistance , biofilm formation and bacterial pathogenesis. The data from this study will assist in future studies of UPEC strains to develop effective control measures.
