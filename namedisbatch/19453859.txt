  Interleukin-10 ( IL-10) polymorphisms have been shown to affect IL-10 production. This study investigated the influences of IL-10 polymorphisms on the susceptibility to chronic periodontitis<disease> ( CP) and aggressive periodontitis<disease> ( AP) , and their possible role in the quantity of subgingival bacteria Aggregatibacter<pathogen> Actinomycetemcomitans<pathogen> and Porphyromonas<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> 92 CP patients , 83 AP patients and 91 periodontal healthy controls were recruited. Serum IL-10 concentration was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). Gene polymorphisms were determined by multiplex SNaPshot technique. Bacteria were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction with TaqMan MGB probes. Taking into account age , gender and periodontal status , IL-10-592 AA , -819 TT and ATA/ATA genotype occurred more frequently in patients with CP than in healthy controls. In CP cases , higher quantity of subgingival A.<pathogen> actinomycetemcomitans<pathogen> and lower serum IL-10 levels could be detected in homozygous ATA/ATA carriers. These findings indicate that variants in IL-10 promoter gene were not only associated with predisposition to chronic periodontitis<disease> but also affected the subgingival number of A.<pathogen> Actinomycetemcomitans<pathogen> in a Chinese Han population.
