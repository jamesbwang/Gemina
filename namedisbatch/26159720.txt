  Enveloped viruses , such as HIV<pathogen> , Ebola<disease> and Influenza<disease> , are among the most deadly known viruses. Cellular membrane penetration of enveloped viruses is a critical step in the cascade of events that lead to entry into the host cell. Conventional ensemble fusion assays rely on collective responses to membrane fusion events , and do not allow direct and quantitative studies of the subtle and intricate fusion details. Such details are accessible via single particle investigation techniques , however. Here , we implement nano-infrared spectroscopic imaging to investigate the chemical and structural modifications that occur prior to membrane fusion in the single archetypal enveloped virus , influenza<disease> X31. We traced in real-space structural and spectroscopic alterations that occur during environmental pH variations in single virus particles. In addition , using nanospectroscopic imaging we quantified the effectiveness of an antiviral compound in stopping viral membrane disruption ( a novel mechanism for inhibiting viral entry into cells) during environmental pH variations.
