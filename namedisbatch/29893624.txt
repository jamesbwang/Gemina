  The objective was to compare diagnosis rates representing developmental outcomes and medical complications between infants with intrauterine opioid exposures who did not receive pharmacologic treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome<disease> at the time of birth and infants for whom no exposure to substances of abuse were detected. This retrospective , descriptive study included approximately 95 % of Hamilton County , Ohio resident births in 2014 and 2015. Universal maternal drug test results , performed at the time of birth , were documented and linked to electronic health records representing pediatric primary and subspecialty follow-up care as well as urgent care , emergency care , and inpatient services provided by Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center through 2017 , when all children were at least 24 months old. Diagnosis rates were compared between drug exposure groups using chi-square tests. Among infants born at > 34 weeks gestation and without other complex clinical conditions , infants with subclinical opioid exposures ( N = 473) were more likely than infants with no drug exposures ( N = 14,933) to be diagnosed with behavioral or emotional disorders ( 3.0 % vs 1.1 % , P = 0.0008) , developmental delay ( 15.6 % vs 7.6 % , P < 0.0001) , speech disorder ( 10.1 % vs 6.5 % , P = 0.001) , or strabismus ( 3.4 % vs 1.0 % , P < 0.0001) , and more likely to be exposed to the hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( 6.8 % vs 0.1 % , P < 0.0001). Increased diagnosis rates among all opioid exposed infants , regardless of withdrawal severity , may warrant the additional allocation of resources for screening and follow-up. Awareness of the increased risk for certain developmental delays and medical conditions is critical to early intervention and treatment supporting improved outcomes.
