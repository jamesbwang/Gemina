  Porites andrewsi white syndrome<disease> ( PAWS) , caused by Vibrio<pathogen> alginolyticus<pathogen> strains XSBZ03 and XSBZ14 , poses a serious threat to corals in the South China Sea. To obtain a specific target against which to develop a rapid PCR detection method for the coral pathogenic strain XSBZ03 , the 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer ( IGS) region of 4 strains of V.<pathogen> alginolyticus<pathogen> , including the XSBZ03 and XSBZ14 strains , was amplified , sequenced and analyzed. Six types of IGS were found: IGS0 , IGSG , IGSIA , IGSAG , IGSGLV , and IGSGLAV. IGS0 , IGSG , IGSIA , IGSAG and IGSGLV appeared to be the most prevalent forms in the 4 strains and the percentage identity range within each type was 91.4-100 % , 89.3-98.5 % , 83.0-99.8 % , 91.5-95.6 % , and 88.7-99.3 % , respectively. IGSGLAV was found only in the HN08155 strain , a causative agent of fish disease. IGSGLAV , IGSGLV and IGSAG are reported here for the first time in V.<pathogen> alginolyticus<pathogen>. An IGS sequence specific to the XSBZ03 strain was identified following alignment of the homologous IGSs , and used to design strain-specific primers for its rapid identification by PCR. The results from PCR analysis suggest that the method is a rapid , practical , and reliable tool for the identification of the XSBZ03 strain in samples of isolated bacteria , as well as seawater and coral samples spiked with the bacterial strain. This is the first report of a rapid diagnostic assay for a causative agent of PAWS , based on PCR detection of a coral pathogen at the strain level. After applying this assay in coral transplantation , the survival rates of transplanted corals were significantly increased. This diagnostic assay should aid with both the elucidation of the cause of the disease , and transplantation of PAWS-free P. andrewsi in the South China Sea.
