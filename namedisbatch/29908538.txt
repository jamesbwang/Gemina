  Neutrophils are the forerunner in innate immunity by defending the host organisms against infectious pathogens. During such process , neutrophils reach the site of inflammation/infection and eliminate the pathogens by phagocytosis as well as by forming the neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs). NETs trap and eradicate a number of microbes including bacteria , fungi<pathogen> , protozoa , viruses. NETs consist of DNA which is decorated with histones and granular proteins such as neutrophil elastase ( NE) , gelatinase , myeloperoxidase. NETosis ( a process of NETs formation) is also involved in many inflammatory and autoimmune disorders with a major contribution to acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> , sepsis<disease> , cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> , periodontitis<disease> Hyper NETosis or ineffective clearance of NETs would likely increase the risk of auto-antibody generation against NETs components and contribution in auto-inflammatory diseases. The purpose of this review is intended to highlight the molecular mechanisms of NETosis and its antimicrobial effect. Furthermore , a current status of NETosis in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders has been reviewed for better understanding.
