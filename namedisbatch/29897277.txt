  Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> is a leading cause of catheter-associated urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> and elimination of these biofilm-based infections without antifungal agents would constitute a significant medical advance. A novel urinary catheter prototype that utilizes on-demand surface deformation is effective at eliminating bacterial biofilms and here the broader applicability of this prototype to remove fungal biofilms has been demonstrated. C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> biofilms were debonded from prototypes by selectively inflating four additional intralumens surrounding the main lumen of the catheters to provide the necessary surface strain to remove the adhered biofilm. Deformable catheters eliminated significantly more biofilm than the controls ( > 90 % eliminated vs 10 % control; p < 0.001). Mechanical testing revealed that fungal biofilms have an elastic modulus of 45 Â± 6.7 kPa with a fracture energy of 0.4-2 J m
