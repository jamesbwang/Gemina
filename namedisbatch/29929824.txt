  Serum hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI) and microneutralization ( MN) antibodies are often used as a correlate of protection for influenza<disease> However , these manual assays are labor-intensive and difficult to standardize due to variability in biologic reagents used and subjective interpretation of the results. Sera with known HAI and MN titers were used to assess a novel test based on the inhibition of fluorescence ` dequenching '. Whole influenza<disease> virions ( A/California/07/ 2009 ( H1N1<pathogen>) , A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 ( H3N2<pathogen>) and B/Brisbane/60/ 2008) labelled with 1,1 '- dioctadecyl-3,3,3 ' ,3 '- tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate ( DiD) were exposed to serial dilutions of serum and mixed with turkey red blood cells followed by acidification of the media ( pH 5.0-5.5). The H1N1<pathogen> and B/Brisbane strains were high hemagglutinating while the H3N2<pathogen> strain had low hemagglutinating activity. In some experiments , labelled virions were subjected to repetitive freeze-thaw cycles prior to use in the assay. In the absence of detectable HAI/MN antibodies , there were consistent and substantial increases from baseline DiD fluorescence upon acidification. Sera with known high titer HAI/MN antibodies reduced or completely prevented DiD dequenching at low dilutions with progressive increases in fluorescence at higher dilutions , which permitted a reproducible assignment of an antibody ` titer ' based on baseline and acidified DiD fluorescence values. The ` titers ' measured by the DiD dequenching assay were highly correlated with HAI/MN results for the H1N1<pathogen> and B strains ( Spearman 's correlation coefficients ( r The DiD dequenching assay may be a labour-saving and more objective alternative to the classic serologies. This novel assay could theoretically be standardized across laboratories using pre-stained virions and has the potential to be fully automated.
