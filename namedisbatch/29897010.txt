  Recently described , the congenital Zika<disease> syndrome<disease> caused by the Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> has many features of other congenital infections. This case series study reports 22 infants with congenital Zika syndrome<disease> in Brazil who developed infantile spasms during their first year of life. The median age of infantile spasms onset was 4.3 ( Â± 1.4) months and ranged from 1 to 7 months. Neurologic evaluation showed that all 22 children presented severe impairment of neuropsychomotor development. A total of 18 infants had an interictal hypsarrhythmia electroencephalogram ( EEG) pattern. Vigabatrin was prescribed as first-line treatment; however , only 5 patients were controlled. Steroid regimes were started for children who did not respond to vigabatrin and they are being followed. In conclusion , congenital Zika syndrome<disease> may be considered as an etiological agent of infantile spasms.
