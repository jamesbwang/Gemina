  In this study , we aimed to determine the late relapse rate in hepatitis<disease> C<disease> patients with sustained virological response after interferon-based regimens , and evaluated the predictors of late relapse while comparing the real-life data of our country with that of others. A multicenter retrospective study was performed to investigate the data of patients infected with HCV<pathogen> who obtained sustained virological response after classical or pegylated interferon alpha ( PegIFNα) and ribavirin ( RBV) for 48 weeks. Sustained virological response was based on negative HCV<pathogen> RNA level by PCR at the end of six months after the therapy. The information of patients enrolled in the study was retrieved from the hospital computer operating system and outpatient follow-up archives. We evaluated the age , gender , HCV<pathogen> RNA levels , HCV<pathogen> genotype , six-month and further follow-up of patients with sustained virologic response , presence of cirrhosis , steatosis and relapse. In all , 606 out of 629 chronic hepatitis<disease> C<disease> patients ( mean age was 53 ± 12 years; 57.6 % of them were female) with sustained virological response were evaluated. We excluded 23 patients who relapsed within six months after the end of treatment ( EOT). The mean follow-up period of the patients was 71 months ( range: 6-136) after therapy. Late relapse rate was 1.8 % ( n = 11) in all patients. Univariate Cox proportional hazard regression models identified that cirrhosis and steatosis were associated with the late relapse ( ( p = 0.027; Hazard Ratio ( HR) 2.328; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.309-80.418) , ( p = 0.021; HR 1.446; 95 % CI: 1.243-14.510 , respectively). In multivariable Cox regression analysis , steatosis was the only independent risk factor for late relapse ( p = 0.03; HR 3.953; 95 % CI: 1.146-13.635). Although the late relapse rate was approximately 2 % in our study , clinicians should consider that pretreatment steatosis may be an important risk factor for late relapse.
