  Hepatitis<pathogen> E<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HEV<pathogen>) is a major cause of viral hepatitis<disease> worldwide. Owing to its feco oral transmission route , sporadic as well as epidemic outbreaks recurrently occur. No specific antiviral therapy is available against the disease caused by HEV<pathogen>. Broad spectrum antivirals such as ribavirin and interferon alfa are prescribed in severe and chronic HEV<pathogen> cases. However , the side effects , cost , and limitations of usage render the available treatment unsuitable for several categories of patients. We recently reported the ability of zinc to inhibit viral replication in mammalian cell culture models of HEV<pathogen> infection. Zinc will be a safe and economical antiviral therapy option if it inhibits HEV<pathogen> replication during the natural course of infection. This essay discusses the putative mechanism ( s) by which zinc inhibits HEV<pathogen> replication and provides an overview of the possible therapeutic potential of zinc in HEV<pathogen> patients.
