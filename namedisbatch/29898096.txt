  Tooth decay is a major public health problem which affects a large number of people in several countries. Even though more than 700 bacterial species have been detected in the oral cavity , Streptococcus<pathogen> and Lactobacillus<pathogen> stand out as the genera that cause tooth decay and other periodontal<disease> diseases<disease>. In this study , essential oils from Citrus aurantifolia leaves ( CL-EO) and fruit peel ( CP-EO) were obtained by hydrodistillation by a Clevenger-type apparatus whereas their chemical composition was analyzed by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector ( GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS). Limonene ( 77.5 %) , linalool ( 20.1 %) , citronellal ( 14.5 %) and citronellol ( 14.2 %) were the main constituents found in the essential oils from C. aurantifolia leaves and fruit peel. Antibacterial activity of essential oils was evaluated in terms of its minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC) values by the broth microdilution method in 96-well microplates. Both CL-EO and CP-EO displayed some activity against all oral pathogens under investigation; MIC values ranged from 20 to 200 µg/mL. CL-EO and CP-EO not only had promising activity against Streptococcus<pathogen> mutans<pathogen> ( MIC = 20 µg/mL) and Lactobacillus<pathogen> casei<pathogen> ( 31.25 µg/mL) , but also displayed antibacterial activity against all studied cariogenic bacteria. Efficacy of essential oils against S.<pathogen> mutans<pathogen> and L casei is noteworthy and should be further investigated.
