  Freshwater bathing is one of the main treatment options available against amoebic gill disease ( AGD) affecting multiple fish hosts in mariculture systems. Prevailing freshwater treatments are designed to be long enough to kill Neoparamoeba perurans , the ectoparasite causing AGD , which may select for freshwater tolerance. Here , we tested whether using shorter , sublethal freshwater treatment durations are a viable alternative to lethal ones for N. perurans ( 2-4 hr). Under in vitro conditions , gill-isolated N. perurans attached to plastic substrate in sea water lifted off after â‰¥ 2 min in freshwater , but survival was not impacted until 60 min. In an in vivo experiment , AGD-affected Atlantic<disease> salmon Salmo<pathogen> salar<pathogen> subjected daily to 30 min ( sublethal to N. perurans) and 120 min ( lethal to N. perurans) freshwater treatments for 6 days consistently reduced N. perurans cell numbers on gills ( based on qPCR analysis) compared to daily 3 min freshwater or seawater treatments for 6 days. Our results suggest that targeting cell detachment rather than cell death with repeated freshwater treatments of shorter duration than typical baths could be used in AGD management. However , the consequences of modifying the intensity of freshwater treatment regimes on freshwater tolerance evolution in N. perurans populations require careful consideration.
