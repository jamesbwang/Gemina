  In AGATE-II , treatment with ombitasvir coformulated with paritaprevir/ritonavir plus ribavirin ( RBV) in Egyptians infected with hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> genotype 4 resulted in high rates of sustained virologic response at post-treatment week 12. This subanalysis examined the effects of treatment in AGATE-II on liver biomarkers in patients with compensated cirrhosis. AGATE-II was a phase 3 , open-label , partly randomized trial of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with weight-based RBV daily once in treatment-naive or treatment-experienced patients. Patients without cirrhosis received treatment for 12 weeks and patients with compensated cirrhosis were randomized 1:1 to the same regimen for either 12 or 24 weeks. Sixty patients with compensated cirrhosis were randomized to treatment for 12 weeks ( n = 31) or 24 weeks ( n = 29). In the 12-week arm , significant improvements were observed in biomarkers of liver injury ( alanine aminotransferase: -53.7 U/L , P < 0.001; aspartate aminotransferase: -35.9 U/L , P < 0.001) and liver fibrosis<disease> ( aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index: -0.987 , P < 0.001; fibrosis-4 index: -1.165 , P < 0.001). Similar results were reported in the 24-week arm. Treatment with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus RBV in hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> genotype , 4-infected Egyptians with compensated cirrhosis resulted in improvements in certain biomarkers of liver synthetic function , injury , and fibrosis<disease> , independent of treatment duration.
