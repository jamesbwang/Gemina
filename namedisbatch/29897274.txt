  Retail seafood in Berlin , Germany , was investigated to detect the prevalence and quantitative load of Enterobacteriaceae that produce extended-spectrum β-lactamase ( ESBL) and AmpC β-lactamase ( AmpC). A total of 160 raw seafood samples were screened for the presence of these bacteria using MacConkey agar supplemented with 1 mg/L cefotaxime after nonselective enrichment. Isolated species were subsequently identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight analysis. ESBL and AmpC production was tested by the disk diffusion method , and ESBL and AmpC genes were characterized using real-time and conventional PCR assays with DNA sequencing. Spread plating was used for quantification of ESBL- and AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Overall , these bacteria were detected in 21.3 % of seafood samples ( 34 of 160 samples) with prevalences of 22.5 and 20 % for shrimp<disease> and bivalves , respectively. Of the positive samples , 91.2 % contained an ESBL- or AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae load of < 100 CFU/g ( lower detection limit) , and 8.8 % contained 100 to 1,000 CFU/g. Among the 45 Enterobacteriaceae isolates , Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> ( 13 isolates) and Escherichia<pathogen> coli ( 12 isolates) were the predominant species. ESBL and AmpC genes were detected in 33 isolates , with the majority of isolates harboring bla
