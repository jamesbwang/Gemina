  Virus<pathogen> infections induce sensitive antiviral responses within the host cell. The RNA helicase retinoic acid-inducible gene I ( RIG-I) is a key sensor of influenza<disease> virus<pathogen> RNA that induces the expression of antiviral type I interferons. Recent evidence suggests a complex pattern of RIG-I regulation involving multiple interactions and cellular sites. In an approach employing affinity purification and quantitative mass spectrometry , we identified proteins with increased binding to RIG-I in response to influenza<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection. Among them was the RIG-I related RNA helicase DEAD box helicase 6 ( DDX6) , a known component of cytoplasmic mRNA-ribonucleoprotein ( mRNP) granules like P-bodies and stress granules ( SGs). RIG-I and DDX6 both localized to the cytosol and were detected in virus-induced SGs. Coimmunoprecipitation assays detected a basal level of complexes harboring RIG-I and DDX6 that increased after infection. Functionally , DDX6 augmented RIG-I mediated induction of interferon ( IFN)- & beta; expression. Notably , DDX6 was found to bind viral RNA capable to stimulate RIG-I. These findings imply a novel function for DDX6 as an RNA co-sensor and signaling enhancer for RIG-I.
