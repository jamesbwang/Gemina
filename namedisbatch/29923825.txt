  The aim of the investigation was to investigate the phylogeny of the 49 type strains of species of Pasteurellaceae and three genomospecies , which are available with whole genomic sequences. The genomes were downloaded from National Center for Biotechnological Information and for three species of Avibacterium<pathogen> sequenced in the present investigation. From the predicted protein sequences of proteins , which were conserved in all genomes , 31 proteins were randomly selected for the study. The protein sequences were concatenated for each taxon , and a multiple alignment reconstructed for the 52 taxa. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by using the maximum-likelihood and neighbour-joining methods and confirmed the classification of the genera , which have been classified based on phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences. The comparison linked ( Haemophilus<pathogen>) parainfluezae and ( Haemophilus<pathogen>) pittmania with Haemophilus<pathogen> influenzae<pathogen> ( type species of genus) although at a much lower level than observed for Haemophilus<pathogen> aegyptius<pathogen> , H.<pathogen> influenzae<disease> and Haemophilus haemolyticus<pathogen>. The comparison documented that three , three and nine species of Actinobacillus<pathogen> , Pasteurella<pathogen> and Haemophilus<pathogen> , respectively , are not properly classified at genus level. Similar conclusions have been drawn by 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons. The highest inter genus pairwise similarity was 88 % based on the comparison of the 31 concatenated protein sequences of the species included in the comparison. The level of intra genus pairwise similarity was also 88 %.
