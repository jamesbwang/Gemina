  Hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV) infection is a major public health problem and immune tolerance is responsible for persistent HBV infection. HBV therapeutic vaccines targeting HBV e antigen ( HBeAg) may have an excellent effect in overcoming HBV immune tolerance. Thus , there is urgency for designing therapeutic vaccine candidates that target HBeAg. In this research , we fused the C ( 472-507) gene sequence of HBV<pathogen> with the extracellular domain of human CD40 ligand sequence and ligated this fused sequence into the pEGFP-N1 vector to construct the recombinant plasmid pEGFP-N1-C ( 472-507)- ecdCD40L. Then , the dendritic cells ( DCs) generated from human peripheral blood were transfected with this recombinant plasmid. After this , the phenotype and function of DCs were assessed. Compared with the three control groups of pEGFP-N1-C ( 472-507) , pEGFP-N1 and phosphate buffered saline ( PBS) , we found that DCs transfected with the recombinant plasmid pEGFP-N1-C ( 472-507)- ecdCD40L enhanced the expression of costimulatory molecules ( CD80 , CD86 and HLA-DR) and secretion of cytokine IL-12p70. Furthermore , the capacity of inducing the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes was also improved. Our study validated that transfecting DCs with recombinant plasmid pEGFP-N1-C ( 472-507)- ecdCD40L could activate DCs and enhance their functions. Therefore , C ( 472-507)- ecdCD40L fusion sequence may be a promising vaccine candidate for chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> therapythat targets HBeAg.
