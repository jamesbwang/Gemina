  Accurate early diagnosis and prompt treatment are one of the key strategies to control and prevent malaria<disease> disease<disease>. External quality assessment is the most effective method for evaluation of the quality of malaria<disease> microscopy diagnosis. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of malaria<disease> microscopy diagnosis and its associated factors in selected public health facility laboratories in East Wollega Zone , Western Ethiopia. Facility-based cross-sectional study design was conducted in 30 randomly selected public health facility laboratories from November 2014 to January 2015 in East Wollega Zone , Western Ethiopia. Ten validated stained malaria<disease> panel slides with known Plasmodium<pathogen> species , developmental stage and parasite density were distributed. Data were captured; cleaned and analyzed using SPSS version 20 statistical software-multivariate logistic regressions and the agreement in reading between the peripheral diagnostic centers and the reference laboratory were done using kappa statistics. A total of 30 health facility laboratories were involved in the study and the overall quality of malaria<disease> microscopy diagnosis was poor ( 62.3 %). The associated predictors of quality in this diagnosis were in-service training ( ( AOR = 16 , 95 % CI ( 1.3 , 1.96)) , smearing quality ( ( AOR = 24 , 95 % CI ( 1.8 , 3.13)) , staining quality ( ( AOR = 15 , 95 % CI ( 2.35 , 8.61) , parasite detection ( ( AOR = 9 , 95 % CI ( 1.1 , 8.52)) and identification skills ( ( AOR = 8.6 , 95 % CI ( 1.21 , 1.63)). Eighteen ( 60 %) of health facility laboratories had in-service trained laboratory professionals on malaria<disease> microscopy diagnosis. Overall quality of malaria<disease> microscopy diagnosis was poor and a significant gap in this service was observed that could impact on its diagnostic services.
