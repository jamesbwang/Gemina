  Transketolases ( TKs) are ubiquitous thiamine pyrophosphate ( TPP)- dependent enzymes of the nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. They are considered as interesting therapeutic targets in numerous diseases and infections ( e.g. , cancer , tuberculosis<disease> , malaria<disease> , for which it is important to find specific and efficient inhibitors. Current TK assays require important amounts of enzyme , are time-consuming , and are not specific. Here , we report a new high throughput electrochemical assay based on the oxidative trapping of the TK-TPP intermediate. After electrode characterization , the enzyme loading , electrochemical protocol , and substrate concentration were optimized. Finally , 96 electrochemical assays could be performed in parallel in only 7 min , which allows a rapid screening of TK inhibitors. Then , 1360 molecules of an in-house chemical library were screened and one early lead compound was identified to inhibit TK from E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> with an IC
