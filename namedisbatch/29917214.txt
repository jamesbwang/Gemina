  Tigecycline is a glycylcycline antimicrobial structurally related to minocycline , with a wide spectrum of activity that includes anaerobes and typical and atypical microorganisms causing pelvic<disease> inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> ( PID). This study aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of tigecycline in complicated PID and un-complicated PID after the failure of first-line antibiotic therapy. Between May 2014 and April 2016 at the 2nd Unit of Obstetrics and Gynecology , Santa Chiara Hospital of Pisa a pilot study on 20 women with mild/moderate PID after the failure of first-line antibiotic therapy and on 8 women with complicated PID was conducted. The treatment protocol was 10-day course of tigecycline , with a loading dose of 100 mg intravenously ( i.v.) at day one and then 50 mg IV twice daily. The primary endpoint was to evaluate tigecycline 's efficacy in terms of clinical response to test-of-cure ( TOC) at the end of therapy and 30 days after the last dose. Clinical response during therapy and safety were analyzed as well. A total of 28 women were enrolled , and 25 patients completed the study protocol , because 3 patients reported adverse drug effects resulting in treatment interruption. PID was mainly caused by Chlamydia<pathogen> , Gardnerella , Mycoplasma/Ureaplasma. Tigecycline showed a 100 % remission of signs and symptoms in patients resistant to first-line antibiotic regimen and in patients with complicated PID. Moreover , tigecycline showed good tolerability and compliance. Despite the limited sample size , tigecycline seemed an effective and safe treatment for women with complicated/resistant PID. Nevertheless , further clinical trials are needed to confirm these results.
