  β-Glucan can provide excellent environment to apply to drug carrier due to its immunological and anti-inflammatory effect. Minocycline hydrochloride ( MH) has excellent oral bioavailability pharmacological properties. Specifically , MH is effectively absorbed into the gingiva for periodontal<disease> disease<disease> treatment. In this study , we attempt to develop MH loaded β-glucan hydrogel for periodontal<disease> disease<disease> treatment through radiation-crosslinking technique. In addition , MH loaded β-glucan hydrogels were tested for their cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity. Finally , we conducted an in vivo study to demonstrate the potential to prevent the invasion of bacteria to treat periodontal<disease> disease<disease> The gel content and compressive strength of the β-glucan hydrogels increased as the β-glucan content and the absorbed dose ( up to 7 kGy) increased. For a radiation dose of 7 kGy , the gelation and the compressive strength of a 6 wt % β-glucan hydrogel were approximately 92 % and 270 kPa , respectively. As a drug , MH was consistently released from β-glucan hydrogels , reaching 80 % at approximately 90 min. Furthermore , the MH loaded β-glucan hydrogels showed no cytotoxicity. The MH loaded β-glucan hydrogels exhibited good antibacterial activity against Porphyromonas<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> In addition , MH loaded β-glucan hydrogel demonstrated the potential of a good capability to prevent the invasion of bacteria and to treat
