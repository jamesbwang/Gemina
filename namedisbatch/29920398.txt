  We conducted benefit-cost analysis of outbreak and surveillance costs for HPAI H5N1in poultry in Nigeria. Poultry 's death directly cost US$ 939,734.0 due to outbreaks. The integrated disease surveillance and response originally created for comprehensive surveillance and laboratory investigation of human<disease> diseases<disease> was adapted for HPAI H5N1<pathogen> in poultry. Input data were obtained from the field , government documents and repositories and peer-reviewed publications. Actual/forecasted bird numbers lost were integrated into a financial model and estimates of losses were calculated. Costs of surveillance as alternative intervention were determined based on previous outbreak control costs and outputs were generated in SurvCost Â® with sensitivity analyses for different scenarios. Uncontrolled outbreaks will lead to loss of over US$ 2.2 billion annually in Nigeria with 47.8 % of the losses coming from eggs. The annual cost of all animal related health activities was < US$ 99.0 million , only one-third of this amount was linked with H5N1<pathogen> surveillance and response activities. Recurrent cost was 96.2 % of the total surveillance and response costs , and 31.0 % of the HPAI surveillance cost was spent on personnel with 3.8 % as capital cost. Cost-wisely , routine monitoring and surveillance for HPAI are 68 times more cost effective than to do nothing. Assuming that successful control and eradication of HPAI H5N1<pathogen> is partially attributable to H5N1<pathogen> surveillance and response , a quarter or half of the success will result in 17 or 34 times more benefits. Although animal surveillance and response activities for avian influenza<disease> appeared expensive , their implementation are economically cost beneficial for developing countries.
