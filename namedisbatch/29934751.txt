  Mongolia has the highest mortality rate of gastric cancer. The early detection of cancer and down-staging screening for high risk patients are essential. Therefore , we aimed to validate serum markers for stratifying patients for further management. Endoscopy and histological examination were performed to determine high risk and gastric cancer patients. Rapid urease test , culture and histological tests were performed to diagnose Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection. Serum pepsinogen ( PG) I and II and anti-H. pylori<pathogen> IgG were measured by ELISA. Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis was used to extract the best cut-off point. Totally 752 non-cancer and 50 consecutive gastric cancer patients were involved. The corpus chronic gastritis<disease> ( 72 %: 36/50 vs. 56.4 %: 427/752) , corpus atrophy ( 42.0 %: 21/50 vs. 18.2 %: 137/752) and intestinal metaplasia ( IM) ( 64.0 %: 32/50 vs. 21.5 %: 162/752) were significantly higher in gastric cancer than non-cancer patients , respectively. Therefore , corpus chronic gastritis<disease> , corpus atrophy and IM were considered as high risk disease. The best serum marker to predict the high risk status was PGI/II < 3.1 ( sensitivity 67.2 % , specificity 61 %) and PGI/II further reduced to < 2.2 ( sensitivity 66 % , specificity 65.1 %) together with PGI < 28 ng/mL ( sensitivity 70 % , specificity 70 %) were the best prediction for gastric cancer. The best cut-off point to diagnose H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection was anti-H. pylori<pathogen> IgG > 8 U/mL. Multivariate analysis showed that anti-H. pylori<pathogen> IgG > 8 U/mL and PGI/II < 3.1 increased risk for high risk status and PGI/II < 3.1 remained to increase risk for gastric cancer. The serum diagnosis using PGI/II < 3.1 cut-off value is valuable marker to predict high risk patients for population based massive screening.
