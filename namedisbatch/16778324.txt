  Cutaneous leishmaniasis<disease> ( CL) is an endemic neglected tropical disease prevalent in several areas where seasonal malaria<disease> transmission is active. We assessed the effect of indoor residual spraying ( IRS) and the mass distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated bednets ( LLINs) for malaria<disease> control on sand fly population diversity and abundance , and its impact on the risk of Leishmania transmission in the district of Baroueli , endemic for CL in Mali. Kemena and Sougoula , two villages in the district of Baroueli , were selected for entomology surveys from March to September 2016 to evaluate sand fly species composition and density , and Leishmania infection rates in the vector Phlebotomus<disease> duboscqi. The surveys followed an annual indoor residual spraying and mass distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated bednets ( IRS/LLINs) that began in 2011 for malaria<disease> vector control. We also carried out a leishmanin skin test ( LST) survey in the two villages to determine the incidence of Leishmania<pathogen> infection in humans living in the endemic area. A total of 2936 sand fly specimens , 1013 males and 1923 females , were collected and identified from the two villages throughout the study period. Fourteen species , 2 belonging to the genus Phlebotomus<disease> and 12 to the genus Sergentomyia , were documented. The genus Sergentomyia constituted 91 % of collected sand flies versus 9 % for the genus Phlebotomus<disease> ( P. duboscqi and P. rodhaini). Of those , P. duboscqi was the most abundant , representing 99.6 % of the collected Phlebotomus<disease> species. In both villages , P. duboscqi was most abundant during the end of dry season ( June). The prevalence of Leishmania<pathogen> infection in individual females of P. duboscqi by PCR was 3.5 %. After 5 years of the IRS/LLINs , the incidence of Leishmania infection in the human population as measured by LST was 4.2 %. Compared to historical data collected from 2005-2008 , a considerable reduction was observed in both sand fly density and prevalence of human Leishmania<pathogen> infection in the villages of Kemena and Sougoula , Baroueli District , following IRS/LLINs. This suggests that IRS/LLINs used for mosquito control also impacts sand fly vectors reducing the incidence of leishmaniasis<disease> NCT00344084. Registered: 23 June 2006.
