  Sierra Leone is a low-income West African country that has dealt with waves of economic , political , and public health challenges in its recent past , including a decade-long brutal civil war and the Ebola<disease> epidemic of 2014-2016. The HIV/AIDS epidemic , which has raged on in the country since 1987 , has long been characterized as stable. The latest UNAIDS report estimates a countrywide HIV<pathogen> prevalence rate of 1.7 % in 2016 among adults aged 15-49 years. However , there are indications that the epidemic may be in fact escalating and unless arrested urgently , has the potential to deteriorate into a major public health emergency. Although there are high levels of HIV<pathogen> awareness among adults ( over 94 %) , uptake in voluntary HIV<pathogen> testing has remained low ( < 30 %) , and under one-third ( 29 %) of the country 's 60,000 people living with HIV/AIDS were on antiretroviral therapy in 2015. This review attempts to address the paucity of scientific information on the subject by presenting the historical and epidemiological background to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Sierra Leone. Other aspects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Sierra Leone are examined , including routine HIV<pathogen> screening and diagnosis , linkage to and retention in HIV<pathogen> care , clinical characteristics and molecular epidemiology , treatment coverage , and prevention strategies. Finally , we identify four key areas of challenge that are hampering current efforts attempting to bring the epidemic under control , and perspective is offered on the way forward.
