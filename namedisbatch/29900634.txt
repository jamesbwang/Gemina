  Myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs) accumulate from many diseases. MDSCs are rarely explored in occult hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection ( OBI). The frequency of M-MDSCs and G-MDSCs in OBI carriers was analyzed for correlation with clinical parameters , which was no different between OBI and healthy individuals , while the frequency of M-MDSCs but G-MDSCs in OBI was significantly lower than that observed in chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> ( CHB) carriers ( 0.4 % vs. 0.7 % , P = 0.0004). The frequency of MDSCs was not correlated with clinical parameters and viral load of OBI , suggesting that the absence of HBsAg in OBI carriers might not induce the accumulation of MDSCs.
