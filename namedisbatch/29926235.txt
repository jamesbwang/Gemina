  The prospective assessment of Clostridium<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> infection ( CDI) impact in inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) flare in outpatient setting has been poorly investigated. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and the associated factors with CDI in IBD outpatients presenting colitis<disease> flares as well as the outcomes following treatment. In this prospective cohort study , conducted from October , 2014 , to July , 2016 , 120 IBD patients ( 55 % presenting colitis<disease> flare) and 40 non-IBD controls were assessed for CDI. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of CDI. Outcome analysis was estimated for recurrent CDI , hospitalization , colectomy , and CDI-associated mortality. The number of patients with CDI was significantly higher in IBD patients experiencing flares than in both inactive IBD and non-IBD groups ( 28.8 vs. 5.6 vs. 0 % , respectively; p = 0.001). Females ( OR = 1.39 , 95 % CI , 1.13-17.18) , younger age ( OR = 0.77 , 95 % CI , 0.65-0.92) , steroid treatment ( OR = 7.42 , 95 % CI , 5.17-40.20) , and infliximab therapy ( OR = 2.97 , 95 % CI , 1.99-24.63) were found to be independently associated with CDI. There was a dose-related increase in the risks of CDI on patients which had taken prednisone. Those treated with vancomycin had a satisfactory response to therapy , but 21 % presented recurrent CDI and 16 % were hospitalized. Neither necessity of colectomy nor mortality was noticed in any patient during the investigation. In IBD outpatients presenting colitis<disease> flares , CDI is highly prevalent. Females , younger age , infliximab , and notably steroid therapy were independently associated with CDI. Most patients with CDI experienced mild-to-moderate disease , and prompt treatment with vancomycin was highly effective , which seems to reduce the serious complication risks.
