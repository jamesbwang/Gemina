  Successful eradication of recurrent hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection following liver transplantation ( HCV<pathogen>) improves graft survival. This study aimed at evaluation of hepatic fibrosis<disease> changes among long-term responders to DAA therapy for recurrent HCV<pathogen> after liver transplantation using noninvasive methods. Patients with significant hepatic fibrosis<disease> ( ≥ F2) who achieved SVR12 after treatment with DAAs for recurrent HCV<pathogen> were included ( n = 52). Hepatic fibrosis<disease> status was assessed , noninvasively , by calculation of fibrosis-4 score ( FIB-4) and Aspartate Aminotransferase Platelet Ratio Index ( APRI) and by measurement of graft stiffness using FibroScan at baseline and 12 and 18 months post-treatment. Acoustic radiation force imaging ( ARFI) was done for all patients 12 and 18 months post-treatment. Patients were classified into two groups based on baseline liver stiffness measurement ( LSM) by FibroScan; significant fibrosis<disease> ( F2; n = 28) and advanced fibrosis<disease> groups ( ≥ F3). Over 18-month follow-up period , there was serial improvement of FIB-4 , APRI , and LSM by FibroScan in both groups. Higher baseline LSM and delayed initiation of antiviral therapy were significant predictors of lack of fibrosis<disease> regression ( P-value 0.01 and 0.04 , respectively). Fibroindices and LSM improved over time in liver transplant recipients who responded to DAAs. Baseline LSM can predict post-treatment fibrosis<disease> regression.
