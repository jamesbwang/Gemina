  Malaria<disease> infection is the severe health concern for a long time. As per the WHO reports , the malarial infection causes huge mortality all around the world and is incomparable with any other infectious<disease> diseases<disease>. The absence of effective treatment options and increasing drug resistance to the available therapeutics like artemisinin and other derivatives demand an efficient alternative to overcome this death burden. Here , we performed the literature survey and sorted the Plasmodium<pathogen> falciparum<pathogen> secretory and membrane proteins to design multi-epitope subunit vaccine using an adjuvant , B-cell- and T-cell epitopes. Every helper T-lymphocyte ( HTL) epitope was IFN-Î³ positive and IL-4 non-inducer. The physicochemical properties , allergenicity , and antigenicity of designed vaccine were analyzed for the safety concern. Homology modeling and refinement were performed to obtain the functional tertiary structure of vaccine protein followed by its molecular docking with the toll-like receptor-4 ( TLR-4) immune receptor. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to check the interaction and stability of the receptor-ligand complex. Lastly , in silico cloning was performed to generate the restriction clone of designed vaccine for the futuristic expression in a microbial expression system. This way , we designed the multi-epitope subunit vaccine to serve the people living in the global endemic zone.
