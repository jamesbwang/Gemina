  The highly infectious<disease> human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) causes both genital warts<disease> and cervical cancer in women. In 2009 , the prevalence of genital warts<disease> in Hong Kong was 203.7 per 100,000 person-years. Cervical cancer , more seriously , was the eight most common cancer among women and girls in Hong Kong , accounting for 2.3 % of all new cancer cases in females in 2014. Cervical cancer is a significant global public health problem and HPV<pathogen> is a major risk factor leading to the development of cervical cancer. HPV<pathogen> is also the most common sexually transmitted disease among university students. This is the first study to examine the acceptability of HPV<pathogen> vaccines and associations with perceptions related to HPV<pathogen> and HPV<pathogen> vaccines among the male baccalaureate student population locally. A self-administrative cross-sectional survey was used to assess whether male baccalaureate students from eight local Hong Kong universities intended to be immunized for HPV<pathogen>. The study also asked questions concerning how its subjects perceived HPV<pathogen> and HPV<pathogen> vaccines using the Health Belief Model. Data collection spanned from June to September 2015. A multiple stepwise regression model was used to examine associations between cognitive factors and subjects ' intention to take up the HPV<pathogen> vaccine. A total of 1,004 ( 83.7 %) students aged 18 and 26 participated in this study. 23.3 % found vaccinating for HPV<pathogen> acceptable , a level correlating with a number of indicators. Subjects were more likely to find vaccinating acceptable if 1) they knew something about HPV<pathogen> vaccines; 2) they understood that men were susceptible to infection by HPV<pathogen>; 3) they realised they could benefit by HPV<pathogen> vaccination , and 4) they were aware of the arguments for and against HPV<pathogen> vaccination , as disseminated by either the media or peers. HPV<pathogen> remains a significant public health concern in Hong Kong and China more broadly. This study 's findings show a disconnect between the perceived and actual risk of being infected with the HPV<pathogen> vaccine among male baccalaureate students. This disconnect may be bridged by informing young men of the benefits of their being vaccinated against HPV<pathogen> , by removing the psychological and financial barriers that prevent them from taking up the vaccine and by improving how primary healthcare providers motivate them to get immunized.
