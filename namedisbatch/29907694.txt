  High-mobility group box-1 ( HMGB1) plays a context-dependent role in autophagy , which is required for hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs) activation. However , the significance of HMGB1-induced HSCs autophagy in liver fibrosis<disease> has not been elucidated. Here , we first documented an enrichment of peripheral and intra-hepatic HMGB1 signal in hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>)- related liver fibrosis<disease> progression , and presented the direct evidence of anatomic proximity of HMGB1 with a-SMA ( a marker for HSCs activation) in cirrhotic liver specimens. Then , we demonstrated the autophagy-inducing effects by serum-sourced HMGB1 in both primary murine HSCs and human HSCs cell line ( LX-2) , reflected by increased number of autophagic vacuoles ( AVs) under the transmission electron microscope and up-regulated protein expression of lipidated microtubule-associated light chain 3 ( LC3-II) ( a marker for autophagosome) in western blot analysis. Intriguingly , there is a possible translocation of endogenous HMGB1 from the nucleus to cytoplasm to extracellular space , during exogenous HMGB1-induced HSCs autophagy. Meanwhile , the dose- and time-dependent effects by recombinant HMGB1 ( rHMGB1) in enhancing LX-2 autophagy and fibrogenesis have been revealed with activated ERK/JNK MAPK and restrained mTOR/STAT3 signaling pathways. Additionally , the ERK or JNK inhibitor could not only inhibit rHMGB1-induced autophagy and fibrogenesis in LX-2 cells , but also restore the suppressed mTOR and STAT3 pathways. Furthermore , using LC3-SiRNA transfected LX-2 , we found HMGB1-induced fibrogenesis is dependent on its autophagy-inducing effects. Finally , we elucidated the involvement of extracellular HMGB1-RAGE axis and endogenous HMGB1 in exogenous HMGB1-induced effects. Our findings could open new perspectives in developing an anti-fibrotic therapy by targeting the HSCs autophagy.
