  Although there is evidence of person-to-person transmission of Middle<pathogen> East<pathogen> Respiratory<disease> Syndrome<disease> Coronavirus<pathogen> ( MERS-CoV) in household and healthcare settings , more data are needed to describe and better understand the risk factors and transmission routes in both settings , as well as the extent that disease severity affects transmission. A sero-epidemiological investigation was conducted among Middle<pathogen> East<pathogen> Respiratory<disease> Syndrome<disease> Coronavirus<pathogen> ( MERS-CoV) case-patients and their household contacts to investigate transmission risk in Abu Dhabi , United Arab Emirates. Cases diagnosed between January 1 , 2013-May 9 , 2014 and their household contacts were approached for enrollment. Demographic , clinical , and exposure history data were collected. Sera were screened by MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein ( N) ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence , with results confirmed by microneutralization assay. Ninety-one percent ( n = 31/34) of case-patients were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and did not require oxygen during hospitalization. MERS-CoV antibodies were detected in 13 of 24 ( 54 %) cases with available sera , including 3 asymptomatic , 9 mildly symptomatic , and 1 severely symptomatic case-patient. No serologic evidence of MERS-CoV transmission was found among 105 household contacts with available sera. Transmission of MERS-CoV was not documented in this investigation of mostly asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases and their household contacts. These results have implications for clinical management of cases and formulation of isolation policies to reduce the risk of transmission.
