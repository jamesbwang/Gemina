  To assess the prevalence of protective antibody titers to polioviruses in adults candidates for solid organ transplant ( SOT) , and to assess the immunogenic response to inactivated polio<disease> vaccine in this population. The study included SOT candidates referred to Immunization Reference Centre of Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases from March 2013 to January 2016. It was conducted in 2 phases. The first one , a cross-sectional seroprevalence study , followed by an uncontrolled analysis of vaccine response among patients without protective antibody titers at baseline. Antibody titers to poliomyelitis<disease> were determined by microneutralization assay. Among 206 SOT candidates included , 156 ( 76 %) had protective antibody titers to all poliovirus<pathogen> serotypes ( 95 % CI: 70-81 %). Proven history of oral vaccination in childhood was not associated with higher seroprevalence of protective antibody. In 97 % of individuals without protective antibody titers at baseline , there was adequate vaccine response with one dose of inactivated polio<disease> vaccine. A relevant proportion of adult candidates for SOT does not have protective titers of antibodies to one or more poliovirus<pathogen> serotype. One dose of inactivated vaccine elicited protective antibody titers in 97 % of these subjects and should be routinely prescribed prior to SOT.
