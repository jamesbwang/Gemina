  Despite effective new treatments for Hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection , development of drug resistance , safety concerns and cost are remaining challenges. More importantly , there is no vaccine available against hepatitis<disease> C<disease> infection. Recent data suggest that there is a strong correlation between spontaneous HCV<pathogen> clearance and human NK cell function , particularly IFN-γ production. Further , IL-15 has innate antiviral activity and is also one of the main factors that activates NK cells to produce IFN-γ. To examine whether IL-15 and IFN-γ have direct antiviral activity against HCV<pathogen> , Huh7 .5 cells were treated with either IFN-γ or IL-15 prior to HCV<pathogen> infection. Our data demonstrate that IFN-γ and IL-15 block HCV<pathogen> replication in vitro. Additionally , we show that IL-15 and IFN-γ do not induce anti-HCV effects through the type I interferon signaling pathway or nitric oxide ( NO) production. Instead , IL-15 and IFN-γ provide protection against HCV<pathogen> via the ERK pathway. Treatment of Huh7 .5 cells with a MEK/ERK inhibitor abrogated the anti-HCV effects of IL-15 and IFN-γ and overexpression of ERK1 prevented HCV<pathogen> replication compared to control transfection. Our in vitro data support the hypothesis that early production of IL-15 and activation of NK cells in the liver lead to control of HCV<pathogen> replication.
