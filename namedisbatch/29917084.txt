  Follicular helper T cells ( TFH) are specialized CD4 T cells required for B-cell help and antibody production. Given the postulated role of immune activation in dengue disease , we measured the expansion and activation of TFH in the circulation ( pTFH) collected from Thai children with laboratory-confirmed acute DENV<pathogen> infection. We found significant expansion and activation of pTFH subsets during acute<disease> infection<disease> with the highest frequencies of activated pTFH ( PD1hi pTFH and PD1 + CD38 + pTFH) detected during the critical phase of illness. Numbers of activated pTFH were higher in patients with secondary compared to primary infections , and in patients with more severe disease. We also found a positive correlation between the frequencies of activated pTFH and the frequencies of plasmablasts. To our knowledge , this is the first ex-vivo analysis of pTFH activation during acute DENV<pathogen> infection. Overall , our study supports the model that pTFH contribute to disease evolution during the critical stage of illness.
