  Systems for standardizing physician payment have been shown to undervalue cognitive clinical encounters. Because health care reform emphasizes value-based approaches , we need an understanding of the way pediatric cognitive specialties are used to contribute to the provision of high-value care. We sought to investigate how clinical and administrative stakeholders perceive the value of pediatric infectious<disease> disease<disease> ( PID) specialists. We conducted qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of physicians and administrators from 5 hospitals across the United States in which children are cared for. All interviews were transcribed and systematically analyzed for common themes. We interviewed 97 stakeholders. Analysis revealed the following 3 domains of value: clinical , organizational , and communicative. Clinically , PID specialists were perceived to be highly valuable in treating patients with unusual infections that respond poorly to therapy , in optimizing the use of antimicrobial agents and in serving as outpatient homes for complex<pathogen> patients. Respondents perceived that PID specialists facilitate communication with patients and their families , the health care team and the media<pathogen>. PID specialists were perceived to generate value by participating in systemwide activities , including antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention. Despite this , much of the valuable work PID specialists perform is difficult to measure causing some administrative stakeholders to question how many PID specialists are necessary to achieve high-quality care. With our findings , we suggest that pediatric cognitive specialties contribute value in multiple ways to the health care delivery system. Many of these domains are difficult to capture by using current metrics , which may lead administrators to overlook valuable work and to under-allocate resources.
