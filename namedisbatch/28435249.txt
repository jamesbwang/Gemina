  Middle<pathogen> East<pathogen> respiratory<disease> syndrome<disease> coronavirus<pathogen> ( MERS-CoV) is a novel human<pathogen> coronavirus<pathogen> that can cause human<pathogen> respiratory<disease> disease<disease>. The development of a detection method for this virus that can lead to rapid and accurate diagnosis would be significant. In this study , we established a nucleic acid visualization technique that combines the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification technique and a vertical flow visualization strip ( RT-LAMP-VF) to detect the N gene of MERS-CoV. The RT-LAMP-VF assay was performed in a constant temperature water bath for 30 min , and the result was visible by the naked eye within 5 min. The RT-LAMP-VF assay was capable of detecting 2 Ã— 10
