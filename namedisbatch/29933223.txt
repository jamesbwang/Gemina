  Tuberculosis<disease> is a major global health problem caused by the bacterium<pathogen> Mycobacterium<disease> tuberculosis<disease> ( Mtb) complex<pathogen>. According to WHO reports , 53 million TB patients died from 2000 to 2016. Therefore , early diagnosis of the disease is of great importance for global health care programs. The restrictions of traditional methods have encouraged the development of innovative methods for rapid , reliable , and cost-effective diagnosis of tuberculosis<disease> In recent years , aptamer-based biosensors or aptasensors have drawn great attention to sensitive and accessible detection of tuberculosis<disease> Aptamers are small short single-stranded molecules of DNA or RNA that fold to a unique form and bind to targets. Once combined with nanomaterials , nano-scale aptasensors provide powerful analytical platforms for diagnosing of tuberculosis<disease> Various groups designed and studied aptamers specific for the whole cells of M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> , mycobacterial proteins and IFN-Î³ for early diagnosis of TB. Advantages such as high specificity and strong affinity , potential for binding to a larger variety of targets , increased stability , lower costs of synthesis and storage requirements , and lower probability of contamination make aptasensors pivotal alternatives for future TB diagnostics. In recent years , the concept of SOMAmer has opened new horizons in high precision detection of tuberculosis<disease> biomarkers. This review article provides a description of the research progresses of aptamer-based and SOMAmer-based biosensors and nanobiosensors for the detection of
