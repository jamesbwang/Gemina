  Calorie restriction ( CR) , also known as energy restriction , has been shown to have a deleterious impact on both adult and aged mouse survival during influenza<disease> virus<pathogen> infection. Natural killer ( NK) cell phenotypic differences contribute to increased susceptibility of adult CR mice. We hypothesized NK cell phenotype from adult and aged C57Bl/6 mice fed NIH-31 diet ad libitum ( AL) would be different from NK cell phenotype from adult and aged mice fed NIH-31/ NIA fortified diet at 40 % CR. We hypothesized NK cell phenotype from mice consuming 40 % CR initiated at 20 months of age would not be different from 40 % CR initiated at 3 months of age. We initiated the 40 % restriction either at the standard 12 weeks of age or at 78 weeks of age. NK cells were isolated and quantified from various tissues using flow cytometry. Aged CR mice had significantly reduced levels of terminally mature ( CD27
