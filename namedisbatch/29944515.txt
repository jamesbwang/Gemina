  Analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication ( AAIM) increases the risk of medical complications during endurance races. We determined how many runners use AAIM before or during races , AAIM types , and factors associated with AAIM use. Cross-sectional study. 21.1-km and 56-km races. Seventy-six thousand six hundred fifty-four race entrants. Participants completed pre-race medical screening questions on AAIM use , running injury or exercise-associated muscle cramping ( EAMC) history , and general medical history. Analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication use , types<pathogen> of AAIM ( % runners; 95 % confidence interval) , and factors associated with AAIM use ( sex , age , race distance , history of running injury or EAMC , and history of chronic<disease> diseases<disease>) ( prevalence ratio ( PR)). Overall , 12.2 % ( 12.0-12.5) runners used AAIM 1 week before and/or during races ( 56 km = 18.6 %; 18.0-19.1 , 21.1 km = 8.3 %; 8.1-8.6) ( P < 0.0001). During races , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) ( 5.3 %; 5.1-5.5) and paracetamol ( 2.6 %; 2.4-2.7) were used mostly. Independent factors ( adjusted PR for sex , age , and race distance; P < 0.0001) associated with AAIM use were running injury ( 2.7; 2.6-2.9) , EAMC ( 2.0; 1.9-2.1) , cardiovascular disease ( CVD) symptoms ( 2.1; 1.8-2.4) , known CVD ( 1.7; 1.5-1.9) , CVD risk factors ( 1.6; 1.5-1.6) , allergies ( 1.6; 1.5-1.7) , cancer ( 1.3; 1.1-1.5) , and respiratory ( 1.7; 1.6-1.8) , gastrointestinal ( 2.0; 1.9-2.2) , nervous system ( 1.9; 1.7-2.1) , kidney/bladder ( 1.8; 1.6-2.0) , endocrine ( 1.5; 1.4-1.7) , and hematological/immune ( 1.5; 1.2-1.8) diseases. 12.2 % runners use AAIM before and/or during races , mostly NSAIDs. Factors ( independent of sex , age , and race distance) associated with AAIM use were history of injuries , EAMC , and numerous chronic<disease> diseases<disease>. We suggest a pre-race screening and educational program to reduce AAIM use in endurance athletes to promote safer races.
