  Flea-borne diseases ( FBDs) impact both human and animal health worldwide. Because adult fleas are obligately hematophagous and can harbor potential pathogens , fleas act as ectoparasites of vertebrates , as well as zoonotic disease vectors. Cat fleas ( Ctenocephalides felis<pathogen>) are important vectors of two zoonotic bacterial genera listed as priority pathogens by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID-USA): Bartonella spp. and Rickettsia<pathogen> spp. , causative agents of bartonelloses and rickettsioses , respectively. In this study , we introduce the first microbiome analysis of C. felis samples from California , determining the presence and abundance of relevant pathogenic genera by characterizing the cat flea microbiome through 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing ( 16S-NGS). Samples from both northern ( NoCal) and southern ( SoCal) California were assessed to expand current knowledge regarding FBDs in the state. We identified Rickettsia and Bartonella , as well as the endosymbiont Wolbachia<pathogen> , as the most abundant genera , followed by less abundant taxa. In comparison to our previous study screening Californian cat fleas for rickettsiae<disease> using PCR/digestion/sequencing of the ompB gene , the 16S-NGS approach applied herein showed a 95 % level of agreement in detecting Rickettsia<pathogen> spp.. There was no overall difference in microbiome diversity between NoCal and SoCal samples. Bacterial taxa identified by 16S-NGS in this study may help to improve epidemiological investigations , pathogen surveillance efforts , and clinical diagnostics of FBDs in California and elsewhere.
