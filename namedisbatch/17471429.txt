  High-pathogenicity avian influenza<disease> viruses continue to circulate in poultry and wild birds and occasionally infect humans , sometimes with fatal outcomes. Development of vaccines is a priority to prepare for potential pandemics but is complicated by antigenic variation of the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin. We report the immunological profile induced by human immunization with modified vaccinia<pathogen> virus<pathogen> Ankara ( MVA) expressing the hemagglutinin gene of influenza<disease> A<pathogen> ( H5N1<pathogen>) virus<pathogen> A/Vietnam/1194/ 04 ( rMVA-H5). In a double-blinded phase 1/2a<pathogen> clinical trial , 79 individuals received 1 or 2 injections of rMVA-H5 or vector control. Twenty-seven study subjects received a booster immunization after 1 year. The breadth , magnitude , and properties of vaccine-induced antibody and T-cell responses were characterized. rMVA-H5 induced broadly reactive antibody responses , demonstrated by protein microarray , hemagglutination inhibition , virus neutralization , and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assays. Antibodies cross-reacted with antigenically distinct H5 viruses , including the recently emerged subtypes H5N6 and H5N8<pathogen> and the currently circulating subtype H5N1<pathogen>. In addition , the induction of T cells specific for H5 viruses of 2 different clades was demonstrated. rMVA-H5 induced immune responses that cross-reacted with H5 viruses of various clades. These findings validate rMVA-H5 as vaccine candidate against antigenically distinct H5 viruses. NTR3401.
