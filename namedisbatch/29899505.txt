  Information on how the oral microbiome develops during early childhood and how external factors influence this ecological process is scarce. We used high-throughput sequencing to characterize bacterial composition in saliva samples collected at 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 months and 7 years of age in 90 longitudinally followed children , for whom clinical , dietary and health data were collected. Bacterial composition patterns changed through time , starting with `` early colonizers '' , including Streptococcus<pathogen> and Veillonella<pathogen>; other bacterial genera such as Neisseria settled after 1 or 2 years of age. Dental<disease> caries<disease> development was associated with diverging microbial composition through time. Streptococcus<pathogen> cristatus<pathogen> appeared to be associated with increased risk of developing tooth decay and its role as potential biomarker of the disease should be studied with species-specific probes. Infants born by C-section had initially skewed bacterial content compared with vaginally delivered infants , but this was recovered with age. Shorter breastfeeding habits and antibiotic treatment during the first 2 years of age were associated with a distinct bacterial composition at later age. The findings presented describe oral microbiota development as an ecological succession where altered colonization pattern during the first year of life may have long-term consequences for child 's oral and systemic health.
