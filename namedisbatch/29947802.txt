  Women enrolled in HIV<pathogen> prevention efficacy trials , are counselled at every visit on prevention of HIV<pathogen> , STIs and pregnancy. Incident pregnancy impacts on efficacy outcomes. Incidence rates of pregnancy and HIV/STIs among women who became pregnant and associated risk factors were assessed. Data from 9165 women participating in HIV<pathogen> prevention trials in KwaZulu-Natal , South Africa , from 2002-2012 were combined. Demographic and behavioural predictors of incidence pregnancy and incidence HIV<pathogen> and STIs were determined using Cox regression models. Overall pregnancy incidence was 9.6 per 100-person year ( py) ( 95 % Cl: 9.1 , 10.3). HIV<pathogen> incidence among pregnant women was 5.93 per 100-py ( 95 % Cl: 4.73 , 7.44). Incidence of STIs among pregnant women for Chlamydia<pathogen> trachomatis<pathogen> , Trichomonas vaginalis<pathogen> , Neisseria<pathogen> gonorrhoeae<pathogen> , and Treponema<pathogen> pallidum<pathogen> ( syphilis<disease> were 10.87 , 7.42 , 3.92 and 1.43 per 100-py , respectively. In the adjusted analyses , we observed overlapping risk factors for HIV<pathogen> acquisition during pregnancy i.e. young age , not married/not cohabitating and low parity. Young women ( < 20 years of age) were over 3 times at higher risk of pregnancy and HIV<pathogen> acquisition. We identified overlapping risk factors for pregnancy and HIV<pathogen> incidence , suggesting an urgent need for appropriate , targeted , individual-centred counselling for women participating in HIV<pathogen> prevention trials.
