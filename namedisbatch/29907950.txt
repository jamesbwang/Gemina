  One of the potential applications of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy ( SERS) is the detection of biological compounds and microorganisms. Here we demonstrate that SERS coupled with principal component analysis ( PCA) serves as a perfect method for determining the taxonomic affiliation of bacteria at the strain level. We demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to distinguish different genoserogroups within a single species , Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> , which is one of the most virulent foodborne pathogens and in some cases contact with which may be fatal. We also postulate that it is possible to detect additional proteins in the L.<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> cell envelope , which provide resistance to benzalkonium chloride and cadmium. A better understanding of this infectious<disease> agent<disease> could help in selecting the appropriate pharmaceutical product for enhanced treatment. Graphical abstract á…Ÿ.
