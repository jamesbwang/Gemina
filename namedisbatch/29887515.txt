  Botulism<disease> is an uncommon severe neuromuscular disorder. We report two recent cases of confirmed infant<disease> botulism<disease> diagnosed in an 11-week and a 5-month-old infant along with electroneuromyogram ( ENMG) findings. Then , we discuss the EMG features of infant<disease> botulism<disease> In severe forms of infant<disease> botulism<disease> , presence of these features might help decide to use botulinum<pathogen> immune globulin.
