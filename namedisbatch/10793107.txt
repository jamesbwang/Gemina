  Limited information is available about the involvement of human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( HNSCCs) in Romanian patients. To evaluate the HPV-attributable fraction in HNSCCs collected in Northeastern Romania. In total , 189 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples ( 99 oral cavity tumors , 28 oropharynx , 48 pharynx , and 14 larynx/hypopharynx) were analyzed for HPV<pathogen> DNA and RNA using Luminex-based assays , and for overexpression of p16INK4a ( p16) by immunohistochemistry. Of the 189 cases , 23 ( 12.2 %) were HPV<pathogen> DNA-positive , comprising half of the oropharyngeal<disease> cases ( 14/28 , 50.0 %) and 9/161 ( 5.6 %) of the non-oropharyngeal cases. HPV16 was the most prevalent HPV<pathogen> type ( 20/23 , 86.9 %) , followed by HPV18 ( 5/23 , 21.7 %) and HPV39 ( 1/23 , 4.3 %). Only two ( 2/189 , 1.1 %) HNSCC cases were HPV-driven , i.e. positive for both HPV<pathogen> DNA and RNA. A very small subset of HNSCC cases within this cohort from Northeastern Romania appeared to be HPV-driven.
