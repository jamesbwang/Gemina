  Background/aim: Dermatophytes are the causative agents of dermatophytosis<disease> , which is a common disease worldwide that affects the hair , skin , and nails. Dermatophytes comprise more than 40 species in 3 genera: Microsporum<pathogen> , Trichophyton , and Epidermaphyton. In this study , we aimed to determine the effectiveness of seven antifungal agents: amphotericin B , terbinafine , itraconazole , voriconazole , ketoconazole , miconazole , and fluconazole. Materials and methods: A sensitivity study was performed using a microdilution method in accordance with the CLSI M38-A2 standards using isolates of Trichophyton<pathogen> rubrum<pathogen> ( n = 55) , Microsporum<pathogen> canis<pathogen> ( n = 9) , and Trichophyton<pathogen> interdigitale ( n = 2) , which were identified by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer region of the rDNA. Results: According to the results of antifungal sensitivity tests , the geometric mean ( GM) minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC) against T.<pathogen> rubrum<pathogen> was 0.10 μg/mL for ketoconazole , 0.20 μg/mL for itraconazole , 0.07 μg/mL for miconazole , 0.48 μg/mL for fluconazole , 2.27 μg/mL for amphotericin B , 0.06 μg/mL for voriconazole , and 0.06 μg/mL for terbinafine. Conclusion: The most effective antifungal drugs were voriconazole and terbinafine , both of which had a GM MIC of 0.06 μg/mL.
