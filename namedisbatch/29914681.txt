  Bovine tuberculosis<disease> ( bTB) is endemic in several areas of South Africa and has been reported in multiple species , including common warthogs ( Phacochoerus africanus). Limited diagnostic tests and disease control programs exist for African wildlife. Thus , there is a need to develop techniques for bTB detection in species such as warthogs to assess their role in disease maintenance and spread in multi-host ecosystems. In this study , we obtained blood samples from warthogs in bTB endemic areas to investigate biomarkers for detection of Mycobacterium<pathogen> bovis<pathogen> infection. Warthog whole blood was incubated in QuantiFERON
