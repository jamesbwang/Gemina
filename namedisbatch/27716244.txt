  Plasmodium<disease> falciparum<disease> malaria<disease> is an important cause of morbidity in northern Uganda. This study was undertaken to assess village- , household- , and individual-level risk factors of asymptomatic falciparum<disease> malaria<disease> in children in 12 villages in northern Uganda. Between 10/2011 and 02/2014 , 1006 apparently healthy children under 16 years old were enrolled in 12 villages using a stratified , multi-stage , cluster survey design and assessed for P.<pathogen> falciparum<disease> malaria<disease> infection using the rapid diagnostic test ( RDT) and thick film microscopy ( TFM) , and structured interviewer-administered questionnaires. Associations between weighted P.<pathogen> falciparum<disease> malaria<disease> prevalence ( pfPR) , based on RDT , and covariates were estimated as odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals ( ORs , 95 % CIs) using logistic models accounting for the survey design. Among 942 ( 93.5 %) children successfully tested , pfPR was 52.4 % by RDT and 32.7 % by TFM. Overall pfPR was lower in villages where indoor residual insecticide spray ( IRS) was , versus not , implemented ( 18.4 % versus 75.2 % , P < 0.0001). However , pfPR was heterogeneous both within IRS ( 10.6-34.8 %) and non-IRS villages ( 63.6-86.2 %). Elevated pfPR was associated with having a sibling who was RDT positive ( OR 5.39 , 95 % CI 2.94-9.90 , P = 0.0006) and reporting a fever<disease> at enrollment ( aOR 4.80 , 95 % CI 1.94-11.9 , P = 0.0094). Decreased pfPR was associated with living in an IRS village ( adjusted OR 0.06 , 95 % CI 0.04-0.07 , P < 0.0001) , in a household with one ( aOR 0.48 , 95 % CI 0.30-0.76) or more than one child below 5 years ( aOR 0.23 , 95 % CI 0.12-0.44 , P The results show high but heterogeneous pfPR in villages in northern Uganda , confirm significantly decreased pfPR associated with IRS implementation , and suggest significant associations with some household characteristics. Further research is needed to elucidate the factors influencing malaria<disease> heterogeneity in villages in Uganda.
