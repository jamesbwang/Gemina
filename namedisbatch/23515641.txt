  We introduce a new venue-informed network degree measure , which we applied to respondent-driven sampling ( RDS) estimators. Using data collected from 746 young MSM in 2014-2016 in Chicago , IL , and Houston , TX , we estimated the population seroprevalence of HIV<pathogen> and syphilis<disease> and risk/protective behaviors , using RDS estimates with self-reported network size as a standard degree measure as well as our proposed venue-informed degree measure. The results indicate that the venue-informed degree measure tended to be more efficient ( smaller variance) and less biased than the other measure in both cities sampled. Venue attendance-adjusted network size may provide a more reliable and accurate degree measure for RDS estimates of the outcomes of interest.
