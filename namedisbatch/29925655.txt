  Human<disease> infection<disease> with highly pathogenic avian influenza<disease> A viruses lead to cause severe diseases and fatalities. We previously identified a potent and broad-neutralizing antibody ( bnAb) , 13D4 , against the H5N1<pathogen> virus. Here , we report the co-crystal structure of 13D4 in complex with the hemagglutinin of A/Vietnam/1194/ 2004 ( H5N1<pathogen>). We show that the heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 ( HCDR3) of 13D4 confers H5N1<pathogen> broad yet specific neutralization against H5N1<pathogen> , undergoing conformational rearrangement to bind to the receptor-binding site ( RBS). Further , we show that mutating four critical residues within the RBS-Trp153 , Lys156 , Lys193 , Leu194-disrupts the binding between 13D4 and HA. Viruses bearing Asn193 instead of Lys/Arg can evade 13D4 neutralization , indicating that Lys193 polymorphism might be , at least in part , involved in the antigenicity of recent H5 genotypes ( such as H5N6 and H5N8<pathogen>) distinguished from H5N1<pathogen>. BnAb 13D4 may offers a template for therapeutic RBS-inhibitor design and serve as an indicator of antigenic change of current H5 viruses.
