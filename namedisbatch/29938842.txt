  In the last few decades there has been an emergence of cryptic Aspergillus<pathogen> as agents of human<disease> infections<disease> due to the increase in immunocompromised population and to the improvement of identification tools. Continuing our study on Aspergillus<pathogen> isolates from clinical origin deposited in a mycological reference centre in the United States , we selected 37 isolates belonging to less common sections of the genus , to study their species diversity and detect cryptic species by using a polyphasic approach. From this set of isolates , a total of 16 species were identified; the most frequent being A.<pathogen> calidoustus<pathogen> ( 48.6 % , section Usti) , A.<pathogen> terreus<pathogen> ( 13.5 % , section Terrei) , and A.<pathogen> nidulans<pathogen> ( 5.7 % , section Nidulantes). The remaining isolates corresponded to 13 species of rare or cryptic Aspergillus<pathogen> , i.e. A.<pathogen> europaeus<pathogen> ( section Cremei); A. iizukae , A. micronesiensis , A. spelaeus ( section Flavipedes); A. pachycristatus , A.<pathogen> quadrilineatus<pathogen> , A. spinulosporus , A.<pathogen> unguis<pathogen> ( section Nidulantes); A.<pathogen> alabamensis<pathogen> , A.<pathogen> carneus<pathogen> , A. hortai ( section Terrei) , A.<pathogen> granulosus<pathogen> ( section Usti); and the new species A. suttoniae ( section Flavipedes) , which is described here. Correct identification of cryptic species is crucial to reveal new potential pathogens , to gather accurate epidemiological data and to choose an appropriate treatment.
