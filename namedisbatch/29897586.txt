  Young people living with human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>)/ acquired immune deficiency syndrome<disease> ( AIDS) ( PLWA) are at risk for HIV<pathogen> stigma. The HIV/AIDS Stigma Instrument for PLWA was administered to 36 young PLWA across six clinics in Bandung , Indonesia , to assess the fear of contagion ( FC) , verbal abuse ( VA) , social isolation ( SI) , workplace stigma ( WS) , health care neglect ( HCN) and negative self-perception ( NSP). The median scores for FC , VA , SI , WS and HCN were all 0 while the median score for NSP was 4. In the last 3 months approximately 45 % of surveyed PLWA felt they did not deserve to live and 64 % felt completely worthless. While these results are preliminary , access to mental health services should be a priority in the clinics that provide antiretroviral therapies.
