  To investigate a potential risk for multiple sclerosis ( MS) after vaccination with Arepanrix , the GlaxoSmithKline AS03-adjuvanted influenza<disease> A<pathogen> ( H1N1<pathogen>) pdm09 vaccine , we used the provincewide immunization registry for Manitoba , Canada , to match 341,347 persons vaccinated during the 2009 pandemic to 485,941 unvaccinated persons on age , sex , address , and a propensity score measuring the probability of vaccination. We used a previously validated algorithm to identify MS cases from provincial hospital , physician , and prescription drug claims databases. After 12 months of follow-up , the age-adjusted incidence rate of MS was 17.7 cases per 100,000 person-years in the Arepanrix cohort and 24.2 per 100,000 in the unvaccinated cohort. The corresponding adjusted hazard ratio was 0.9. We observed similar patterns when we measured incidence over the entire follow-up period. The AS03 adjuvant , a candidate for inclusion in future pandemic vaccines , does not appear to increase the short-term risk for MS when included in influenza<disease> vaccines.
