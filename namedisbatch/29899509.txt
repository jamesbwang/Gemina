  Improved understanding of the nutritional ecology of arbuscular mycorrhizal ( AM) fungi<pathogen> is important in understanding how tropical forests maintain high productivity on low-fertility soils. Relatively little is known about how AM fungi<pathogen> will respond to changes in nutrient inputs in tropical forests , which hampers our ability to assess how forest<disease> productivity will be influenced by anthropogenic change. Here we assessed the influence of long-term inorganic and organic nutrient additions and nutrient depletion on AM fungi<pathogen> , using two adjacent experiments in a lowland tropical forest<disease> in Panama. We characterised AM fungal communities in soil and roots using 454-pyrosequencing , and quantified AM fungal abundance using microscopy and a lipid biomarker. Phosphorus and nitrogen addition reduced the abundance of AM fungi<pathogen> to a similar extent , but affected community composition in different ways. Nutrient depletion ( removal of leaf litter) had a pronounced effect on AM fungal community composition , affecting nearly as many OTUs as phosphorus addition. The addition of nutrients in organic form ( leaf litter) had little effect on any AM fungal parameter. Soil AM fungal communities responded more strongly to changes in nutrient availability than communities in roots. This suggests that the ` dual niches ' of AM fungi<pathogen> in soil versus roots are structured to different degrees by abiotic environmental filters , and biotic filters imposed by the plant host. Our findings indicate that AM fungal communities are fine-tuned to nutrient regimes , and support future studies aiming to link AM fungal community dynamics with ecosystem function.
