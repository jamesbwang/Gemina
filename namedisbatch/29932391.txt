  Bacteraemia<disease> caused by Escherichia<pathogen> coli is a growing problem with a significant mortality. The factors that influence the acquisition and outcome of these infections are not clear. Here , we have linked detailed genetic data from the whole-genome sequencing of 162 bacteraemic isolates collected in Scotland , UK , in 2013-2015 , with clinical data in order to delineate bacterial and host factors that influence the acquisition in hospital or the community , outcome and antibiotic resistance. We identified four major sequence types ( STs) in these isolates: ST131 , ST69 , ST73 and ST95. Nearly 50 % of the bacteraemic isolates had a urinary origin. ST69 was genetically distinct from the other STs , with significantly less sharing of accessory genes and with a distinct plasmid population. Virulence genes were widespread and diversely distributed between the dominant STs. ST131 was significantly associated with hospital-associated infections ( HAIs) , and ST69 with those from the community. However , there was no association of ST with outcome , although patients with HAI had a higher immediate mortality compared to those with community-associated infections ( CAIs). Genome-wide association studies revealed genes involved in antibiotic persistence as significantly associated with HAIs and those encoding elements of a type VI secretion system with CAIs. Antibiotic resistance was common , and there were networks of correlated resistance genes and phenotypic antibiotic resistance. This study has revealed the complex interactions between the genotype of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and its ability to cause bacteraemia<disease> , and some of the determinants influencing hospital or community acquisition. In part , these are shaped by antibiotic usage , but strain-specific factors are also important.
