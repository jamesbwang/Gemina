  Probiotic usage has become popular with both medical practitioners and the community in general; patients commonly seek advice regarding what , if any , such preparation would be useful for their own diseases. Since such advice should be evidence-based , identified randomized clinical trials ( RCTs) for a number of gastrointestinal conditions were reviewed; the data were organized by individual probiotic genera/species. Only trials in adults were considered. Most of the identified RCTs were small and low-quality , so any conclusions to be drawn will be limited at least by methodologic problems. Using the GRADE system to consider the reliability of the evidence generated from these RCTs , it did appear that the use of fecal microbial transplantation to treat recurrent Clostridium<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> infection is well justified. Given the methodologic issues , there was moderately good evidence for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea<disease> with Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium<pathogen> , Streptococcus<pathogen> , or Saccharomyces<pathogen> boulardii and for using Lactobacillus<pathogen> , Bifidobacterium<pathogen> , or Saccharomyces<pathogen> as adjunct therapy in the treatment of Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> There were other conditions for which some supportive evidence was available. These conditions include VSL # 3 for maintaining remissions in patients with pouchitis or treating active ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) , fecal microbial transplantation for treating active UC , Bifidobacterium<pathogen> for treating patients with UC in remission , Lactobacillus in patients with painful diverticulosis , a variety of probiotics ( Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium<pathogen> , Streptococcus<pathogen> , or VSL # 3) in patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy , and providing synbiotics to patients postoperatively after liver transplantation. Unfortunately , other limitations in the evidence made it very likely that future research will have an effect on the estimated benefit; these interventions can not yet be recommended for routine use.
