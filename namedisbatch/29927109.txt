  Shigella<pathogen> is an enteroinvasive human pathogen that infects the colonic epithelium and causes Shigellosis<disease> , an infectious diarrheal disease. There is no vaccine for the prevention or treatment of Shigellosis<disease> and antibiotic-resistant strains of Shigella<pathogen> are increasing , emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of Shigella<pathogen> pathogenesis in order to design effective antimicrobial therapies. Small animal models do not recapitulate Shigellosis<disease> , therefore tissue-cultured cells have served as model systems to study Shigella<pathogen> pathogenesis. Here , protocols to enumerate Shigella<pathogen> invasion , cell-cell spread , and plaque formation in the tissue-cultured cell lines Henle-407 and CoN-841 are described. Additionally , a new method to study Shigella<pathogen> invasion in primary intestinal enteroids is described. These protocols can be used to examine different aspects of Shigella<pathogen> virulence. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
