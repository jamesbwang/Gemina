  The outbreak of MDR and XDR strains of Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> and increased resistance to infection in burn patients recommend the issue of infection control. In this research , we study ZOUSH herbal ointment for gene silencing of Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> The herbal ZOUSH ointment was formulated by alcoholic extracts of plants Satureja khuzestaniea , Zataria multiflora , Mentha Mozaffariani Jamzad , honey , and polyurethane. The MIC and disk diffusion tests were examined by single , binary , tertiary and five compounds. Three-week-old mice were considered to be second-degree infections by Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> During the interval of 5 days , cultures were done from the liver , blood , and wound<disease> by four consecutive quarters and counting of Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> was reported in the liver. In this study , silver sulfadiazine ointments and Akbar were used as a positive control. The gene gyrA reference was used as the control. Real-time RT-PCR results were evaluated based on Livak as the comparative Ct method. The In vitro results indicated that wound<disease> infection<disease> was improved by healing wound<disease> size in the treatment groups compared to control treatment group. In this research , the changes in gene expression were evaluated by molecular technique Real-time RT-PCR. The results showed downregulation exoS , lasA , and lasB after treatment with ZOUSH ointment. SPSS Analyses showed that reduction of expressions in genes exoS , lasA and lasB after treatment with ZOUSH ointment were significantly meaningful ( p < 0.05). Our study showed that ZOUSH ointment has the positive effect for gene silencing Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> in the mouse model with the second-degree burn. The positive effects decreased in the number of bacteria by reducing the expression of virulence bacteria genes as exoS , lasA and lasB and improvement of wound<disease> healing.
