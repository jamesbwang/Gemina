  Respiratory<pathogen> syncytial<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( RSV<pathogen>) is the primary cause of acute lower respiratory<disease> infections<disease> in children , bronchiolitis<disease> in particular. Airborne particulate matter ( PM) may influence the children 's immune system and foster the spread of RSV<pathogen> infection. We aimed to verify whether PM10 exposure is associated with hospitalization due to RSV<pathogen> bronchiolitis<disease>. We selected hospital discharge records ( HRD) with ICD-9-CM code 466.11 of infants < 1 year of age , occurring in the epidemic seasons of two years ( 2012-2013) in Lombardy , Italy. Cases were assigned daily PM10 and apparent temperature levels of the capital city of their residential province. Different exposure windows were considered: single days preceding hospitalization ( lag 0 to 30) , their average estimates ( lag 0-1 to 0-30) , and the four weeks preceding hospitalization ( week 1 to 4). Negative binomial regression models adjusted for apparent temperature and season were applied to the daily counts of hospitalizations in each province. Results were expressed as incidence rate ratios ( IRR) and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI) per 10 Âµg/m
