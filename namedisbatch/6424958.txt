  Substantial proportion of liver diseases worldwide is caused by hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) and hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infections which manifest not only as an acute illness but also lead to chronic sequelae. Together HBV and HCV<pathogen> cause chronic<disease> infection<disease> in more than 500 million persons and about one million deaths annually. Most of the people with chronic<disease> infection<disease> are not aware of the infection thus enabling it to go unnoticed , and undiagnosed and act as a potential source of infection for the community at large. Therefore , we aimed to find the prevalence of HBV and HCV<pathogen> in Barabanki , Uttar Pradesh among individuals attending the tertiary care hospital. From February 2015 to January 2016 , 3750 patients attending the outdoor patient departments or admitted to the indoor patient departments of teaching hospital and advised to undergo HBV and HCV<pathogen> for screening before any invasive/surgical procedure were included in the study. Screening was done by rapid card test followed by the confirmation of all samples by enzyme immunoassay. Seroprevalence of HBV and HCV<pathogen> was found to be 3.9 % and 1.76 % respectively with higher seroprevalence among males and in married participants in both infections. Blood transfusion is statistically a significant risk factor for HCV<pathogen> infection ( Higher seroprevalence of HBV and HCV<pathogen> among the hospital-based population mandates screening of high-risk individuals. Awareness by health education of safe sexual practices and improved safety of blood and its products are among the most important preventive measures to control HBV and HCV<pathogen> infection.
