  Cryptosporidium is a protozoan , apicomplexan , parasite that poses significant risk to humans and animals , as a common cause of potentially fatal diarrhea<disease> in immunodeficient hosts. The parasites have evolved a number of unique biological features that allow them to thrive in a highly specialized parasitic lifestyle. For example , the genome of Cryptosporidium parvum<pathogen> is highly reduced , encoding only 3,805 proteins , which is also reflected in its reduced cellular and organellar content and functions. As such , its remnant mitochondrion , dubbed a mitosome , is one of the smallest mitochondria yet found. While numerous studies have attempted to discover the function ( s) of the C.<pathogen> parvum<pathogen> mitosome , most of them have been focused on in silico predictions. Here , we have localized components of a biochemical pathway in the C.<pathogen> parvum<pathogen> mitosome , in our investigations into the functions of this peculiar mitochondrial organelle. We have shown that three proteins involved in the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster biosynthetic pathway are localized in the organelle , and one of them can functionally replace its yeast homolog. Thus , it seems that the C.<pathogen> parvum<pathogen> mitosome is involved in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis , supporting the organellar and cytosolic apoproteins. These results spearhead further research on elucidating the functions of the mitosome and broaden our understanding in the minimalistic adaptations of these organelles.
