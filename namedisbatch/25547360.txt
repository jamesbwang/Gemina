  Baloxavir acid ( BXA) , derived from the prodrug baloxavir marboxil ( BXM) , potently and selectively inhibits the cap-dependent endonuclease within the polymerase PA subunit of influenza<disease> A<pathogen> and B viruses. In clinical trials , single doses of BXM profoundly decrease viral titers as well as alleviating influenza<disease> symptoms. Here , we characterize the impact on BXA susceptibility and replicative capacity of variant viruses detected in the post-treatment monitoring of the clinical studies. We find that the PA I38T substitution is a major pathway for reduced susceptibility to BXA , with 30- to 50-fold and 7-fold EC
