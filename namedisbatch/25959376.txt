  Psoriasis is a chronic , systemic<disease> disease<disease> with the beneficial effect of topical vitamin D3 analogs , known for a long time. Low levels of vitamin D are increasingly found to be associated with the initial development of some autoimmune diseases. There are contradictory reports of low serum levels of vitamin D3 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. ( 1) To determine the serum levels of vitamin D , calcium and C-reactive protein ( CRP) in patients with psoriasis vulgaris<pathogen> , ( 2) To compare these levels with the serum levels of controls , and ( 3) To correlate them with the severity of the disease. A hospital-based case-control study with 61 patients of psoriasis and 61 age- and sex-matched controls was undertaken. A detailed history was taken and examination including body mass index , Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ( PASI) was done. Estimations of serum vitamin D , serum calcium , and CRP levels were done. Mean 25 ( OH) vitamin D level was not significantly different between persons with and without psoriasis. Mean vitamin D level in cases was 18.41 ± 9.41 and that in controls was 17.24 ± 13.03 ( Serum level of vitamin D did not correlate with the severity of psoriasis in our study.
