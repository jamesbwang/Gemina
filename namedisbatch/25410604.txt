  The present study aims at investigating the progress made toward controlling the human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>)/ AIDS epidemic among female sex workers ( FSW) from 2009 to 2016. The baseline of respondent-driven sampling ( RDS) study among FSW was carried out in 2009 , in 10 Brazilian municipalities. In 2016 , information on FSW were collected in 12 municipalities. The analyses took into account the dependence among observations , resulting from the recruitment chains , and the unequal probabilities of selection , resulting from the different network sizes. We analyzed changes in attitudes and risky behavior practices as well as variations in HIV<pathogen> and syphilis<disease> prevalence based on the comparison of 95 % confidence intervals for each estimate. Information on 2523 ( 2009) and 4245 ( 2016) FSW were analyzed. Commercial sex debut shifted to younger ages: while in 2009 the proportion of women who started sex work under 18 years old was 28.3 % , in 2016 this percentage rose to 38.3 %. The proportion of FSW affiliated to a nongovernmental organization ( NGO) in defense of their rights ( 14.0 %) , in 2009 , decreased to 7.8 % , in 2016 , as well as the proportion of FSW who received counseling on sexually transmitted infections ( STI) in the past 6 months , from 47.5 % to 24.4 %. Relevant improvements were found for HIV<pathogen> testing in the last 12 months ( from 20.3 % to 39.3 %). The proportions of those who were never tested for syphilis<disease> dropped from 57.9 % to 48.5 %. However , an opposite decreasing trend was found for the Pap smear examination in the last 12 months , decreasing from 43.6 % to 31.5 %. Regular condom use with clients significantly increased in the period. Regarding HIV<pathogen> prevalence , the 5 % level was sustained and no significant differences were found , but syphilis<disease> prevalence was found to be more than 3 times higher in 2016 ( 8.5 %) than in 2009 ( 2.4 %). Many are the challenges to be faced in attempting to reverse the upward trend of syphilis<disease> among FSW in Brazil. Despite the progress in condom distribution free of charge , it is necessary to increase awareness campaigns , emphasize the use , reaffirm STI counseling , and reiterate the need of regular syphilis<disease> screening in this key population group.
