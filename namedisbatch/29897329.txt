  The sudden and explosive expansion of Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) from the African continent through Oceania and culminating in the outbreak in South America has highlighted the importance of new rapid point-of-care diagnostic tools for the control and prevention of transmission. ZIKV infection has devastating consequences , such as neurological congenital malformations in infants born to infected mothers and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome<disease> in adults. Additionally , its potential for transmission through vector bites , as well as from person to person through blood transfusions and sexual contact , are important considerations for prompt diagnosis. Recombinase polymerase amplification ( RPA) , an isothermal method , was developed as an alternative field-applicable assay to PCR. Here we report the development of a novel ZIKV real-time reverse transcriptase RPA ( RT-RPA) assay capable of detecting a range of different ZIKV strains from a variety of geographical locations. The ZIKV RT-RPA was shown to be highly sensitive , being capable of detecting as few as five copies of target nucleic acid per reaction , and suitable for use with a battery-operated portable device. The ZIKV RT-RPA demonstrated 100 % specificity and 83 % sensitivity in clinical samples. Furthermore , we determined that the ZIKV RT-RPA is a versatile assay that can be applied to crude samples , such as saliva and serum , and can be used as a vector surveillance tool on crude mosquito homogenates. Therefore , the developed ZIKV RT-RPA is a useful diagnostic tool that can be transferred to a resource-limited location , eliminating the need for a specialized and sophisticated laboratory environment and highly trained staff.
