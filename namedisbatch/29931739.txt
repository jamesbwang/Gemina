  As a soilborne fungus , Fusarium<pathogen> oxysporum<pathogen> can cause vascular wilt in numerous economically important crops. Application of antifungal drugs is the primary method for the control of F.<pathogen> oxysporum<pathogen>. Cyp51 , a key enzyme of sterol biosynthesis is the main target of sterol demethylation inhibitors. The F.<pathogen> oxysporum<pathogen> genome contains three paralogous CYP51 genes ( named FoCYP51A ,- B and- C) that putatively encode sterol 14α-demethylase enzymes. Each of the three genes was able to partially complement the Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> ERG11 mutant. Growth assays demonstrated that deletion mutants of FoCYP51B , but not FoCYP51A and- C were significantly retarded in hyphal growth. Deletion of FoCYP51A ( ΔFoCyp51A and ΔFoCyp51AC) led to increased sensitivity to 11 sterol demethylation inhibitors ( DMIs). Interestingly , FoCYP51B deletion mutants ( ΔFoCyp51B and ΔFoCyp51BC) exhibited significantly increased sensitivity to only 4 DMIs ( 2 of which are in common with the 11 DMIs above). Deletion of FoCYP51C did not change DMI sensitivity of F.<pathogen> oxysporum<pathogen>. None of the three FoCYP51s is involved in F.<pathogen> oxysporum<pathogen> virulence. The sensitivity of F.<pathogen> oxysporum<pathogen> isolates increased significantly when subjected to a mixture of different subgroups of demethylase inhibitors ( DMIs) classified based on the different sensitivities of FoCYP51 mutants to DMIs compared to the individual components. FoCYP51A and FoCYP51B are responsible for sensitivity to different azoles. This findings have direct implications for fungicide application strategies of plant and human<disease> diseases<disease> caused by F.<pathogen> oxysporum<pathogen>.
