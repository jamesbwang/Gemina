  This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence and viremic infection of hepatitis<pathogen> delta<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HDV<pathogen>) in Kermanshah. Hepatitis<disease> delta is one of the most complex viral<disease> infections<disease> of liver that along with hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> could lead to fulminant hepatitis<disease> , progressive chronic hepatitis<disease> , cirrhosis , and hepatocellular carcinoma. Referrals with positive HBs Ag were included and tested for HDV<pathogen> Ab using ELISA. Seropositives were subsequently evaluated for viremia by assaying HDV<pathogen> RNA and HBV<pathogen> DNA using real-time PCR. Viremia-related variables were also assessed. From 1749 patients included , 30 had positive HDV Ab , which makes HDV<pathogen> seroprevalence 1.7 %. Twenty-nine out of 30 seropositives were assayed for viremia. Fourteen cases ( 48.3 %) had positive HDV<pathogen> PCR , 18 ( 62.1 %) had positive HBV<pathogen> DNA. Eight patients ( 27.6 %) had simultaneous replication of HBV and HDV<pathogen> , six ( 20.7 %) only had HDV<pathogen> replication , ten ( 34.5 %) only had HBV replication and five ( 17.2 %) had no replication of either viruses. Kermanshah seems to be a low prevalent area in Middle<pathogen> East. Viremic HDV<pathogen> infection was lower compared to Europe and Africa , probably due to genetic variations of the hosts or the differences in genotypes or sub-types of hepatitis<disease> B<disease> and D viruses.
