  To prevent viral<disease> infection<disease> at the site of entry , mucosal vaccines are potent tools for inducing IgA secretion for defense. Because Toll-like receptor ( TLR) ligands serve as strong adjuvants , two ligands that mimic the structure of mycoplasmal and bacterial lipopeptides represent interesting vaccine candidates. Pam3CSK4 , a synthetic triacylated lipopeptide , interacts with TLR2/1. Because fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1 ( FSL-1) , a synthetic diacylated lipopeptide , is recognized by TLR2/6 , we targeted the potential immuno-inducibility of Pam3CSK4 and FSL-1 as adjuvants of an enterovirus<pathogen> 71 ( EV71) mucosal vaccine. Naïve BALB/c mice were used for intranasal immunization three times over a 3-week interval , with results showing that EV71-specific IgG and IgA in serum , nasal washes , bronchoalveolar lavage fluid , and feces from the EV71 + FSL-1 group were significantly higher than levels observed in mice treated with EV71 + Pam3CSK4 , EV71 alone , or the control group treated with phosphate-buffered saline. Furthermore , we observed more EV71-specific IgG and IgA-producing cells in treatments using EV71 formulated with FSL-1. Additionally , T cell-proliferative responses and interferon-γ and interleukin-17 secretion were significantly increased when inactivated EV71 was formulated using FSL-1. Moreover , serum from immunized mice was capable of neutralizing the infectivity of EV71 ( C2 genotype) and was able to cross-neutralize the B4 and B5 genotypes of EV71. Our data suggested that FSL-1 could be used as an efficient adjuvant for intranasal EV71-vaccine immunization.
