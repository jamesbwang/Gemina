  Although ferret antisera used in influenza<disease> surveillance did not detect antigenic drift of A ( H1N1<pathogen>) pdm09 viruses during 2015-16 season , low vaccine effectiveness was reported in adults. We investigated the immune basis of low responses to circulating A ( H1N1<pathogen>) pdm09 viruses following vaccination. Over 300 paired adult ( 18-49 yrs) pre and post-vaccination sera collected in 6 seasons ( 2010-11 to 2015-16) were analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition assays to evaluate the antibody responses to thirteen A ( H1N1<pathogen>) viruses<pathogen> circulated from 1977 to 2016. Microneutralization and serum adsorption assays were used to verify 163K- and 223R-specificity of antibodies. Individual antibody profiles to A ( H1N1<pathogen>) viruses<pathogen> revealed three priming patterns: USSR/77- , TW/86- or NC/99-priming. Over 20 % of adults had reduced titers to cell-propagated circulating 6B .1 and 6B .2 A ( H1N1<pathogen>) pdm09 viruses compared to the A/California/07/ 2009 vaccine virus X-179A. Significantly reduced antibody reactivity to circulating viruses bearing K163Q was only observed in USSR/77-primed cohort , whereas significantly lower reactivity caused by egg-adapted Q223R change was detected across all 3 cohorts. Both 163K-specificity driven by immune priming and 223R-specificity from egg-adapted changes in the vaccine contributed to low responses to circulating A ( H1N1<pathogen>) pdm09 viruses following vaccination. Our study highlights the need to incorporate human serology in influenza<disease> surveillance and vaccine strain selection.
