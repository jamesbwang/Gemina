  The rising use of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine ( SP) in the treatment of chloroquine ( CQ)- resistant Plasmodium<pathogen> falciparum<pathogen> has resulted in increased exposure to P.<pathogen> vivax<disease> isolates in Iran , where both species are being circulated. In this investigation , the frequency of pvdhfr and pvmdr-1 mutants was assessed in P.<pathogen> vivax<disease> strains during 2001-2016 after the introduction of SP/CQ in malarious areas of Iran. The P.<pathogen> vivax<disease> isolates ( n , 52) were obtained from autochthonous samples in Southeast Iran during 2015-2016. The genomic DNA was extracted and examined using nested polymerase chain reaction- ( PCR) and sequencing. Mutations were detected in pvdhfr codons P33L ( 21.2 %) , T61 M ( 25 %) , S93H ( 3.9 %) , and S117 T ( 1.9 %) and 5 isolates showed double mutations ( 33 L/61 M , 7.7 %; 33 L/117 T , 1.9 %). No mutation was identified in pvdhfr codons F57 and S58. The pvmdr-1 1076 L mutation was detected in 93.3 % of P.<pathogen> vivax<disease> isolates. The findings indicated that the frequency of three codons of pvdhfr F57/S58/S117 has decreased from 2001 ( 1.05 %/ 7.0 %/ 16.9 %) to 2016 ( 0 %/ 0 %/ 1.9 %). Genomic analysis of pvmdr-1 showed that the frequency of 1076 L has gradually increased from 2013 ( 93 %) to 2016 ( 93.3 %) ( P > .05). The results demonstrated that P.<pathogen> vivax<disease> isolates are probably being exited under SP pressure , which reflects the appropriate level of training for field microscopists , as established by Iranian policymakers. Emergent pvdhfr codons 33L , 61M , and 93H should be noticed in plausible drug tolerance and treatment plans. The high prevalence of pvmdr-1 1076L mutation shows that efficacy of CQ combination with primaquine may be in danger of being compromised , however further investigations are needed to evaluate the clinical importance of CQ-resistant P.<pathogen> vivax<disease> isolates.
