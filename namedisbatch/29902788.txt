  The presence in a geographic area of Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> ( Mtb) strains belonging to different phylogeographic lineages and showing different drug susceptibility patterns may suggest recent transmission , with implications in terms of patient clinical management and disease control. The aim of this study was to carry out a preliminary epidemiological investigation of tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) cases in Rome. A total of 232 Mtb isolates , collected from new or previously treated patients , admitted between 2008 and 2014 at 2 hospital settings in Rome with a diagnosis of TB , were analyzed by spoligotyping and analyzing 24 variable-number tandem repeats ( VNTR) mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit ( MIRU) loci. The SITVIT2 database and the MIRU-VNTRplus web applications were used to identify the strain genotypes and to generate phylogenetic trees. Based on the position on the phylogenetic tree , 97.4 % of the strains were associated with 1 of the 7 main lineages. The Euro-American lineage was the most commonly represented ( 81.9 %) within both Italian and foreign-born populations , although all main lineages were present. The highest frequency of drug-resistant strains was found among the East-Asian lineage ( Beijing genotype) isolated from foreign-born patients. Dynamics of TB transmission in Rome indicate recent spread of Mtb strains belonging to phylogeographic lineages and clades usually found in countries and geographic areas with a high incidence of TB , similarly to what is observed in most metropolitan areas in Western Europe. Knowledge from molecular and classical epidemiology provides an important tool for disease control.
