  Acute interstitial pneumonia<disease> ( AIP) is a severe disease of unknown etiology. Pneumocystis<pathogen> jirovecii<pathogen> is an atypical opportunistic fungus able to colonize patients with chronic pulmonary disease and inducing alveolar macrophage activation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible association between Pneumocystis<pathogen> jirovecii<pathogen> and AIP. The presence of P.<pathogen> jirovecii<pathogen> in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in the four confirmed cases of AIP identified in a tertiary-care hospital over a period of nine years was studied using a 2-step nested-PCR protocol assay. P.<pathogen> jirovecii<pathogen> was identified in the four cases. None of them had HIV<pathogen> infection. Two of the patients were treated empirically with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole , the only survivor was being one of them. Our data suggest that Pneumocystis<pathogen> could trigger or favor the development of AIP. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of the pathogen in the physiopathology of this disease.
