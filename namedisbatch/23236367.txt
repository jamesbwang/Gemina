  Human noroviruses ( HuNoVs) are a prominent cause of gastroenteritis<disease> , yet fundamental questions remain regarding epidemiology , diversity , and immunity in sub-Saharan African children. We investigated HuNoV seroprevalence and genetic and sociodemographic risk factors in Ugandan children. We randomly screened 797 participants of a longitudinal birth cohort ( Entebbe , EMaBS) and 378 from a cross-sectional survey ( rural Lake<pathogen> Victoria , LaVIISWA) , for antibodies against HuNoV genotypes by ELISA. We used linear regression modeling to test for associations between HuNoV antibody levels and sociodemographic factors , and with the human susceptibility rs601338 FUT2 secretor SNP and histo-blood group antigens ( A/B/O). Of EMaBS participants , 76.6 % were seropositive by age 1 , rising to 94.5 % by age 2 years. Seroprevalence in 1 year olds of the rural LaVIISWA survey was even higher ( 95 %). In the birth cohort , 99 % of seropositive 2 year olds had responses to multiple HuNoV genotypes. We identified associations between secretor status and genogroup GII antibody levels ( GII .4 P = 3.1 × 10-52) , as well as ABO and GI ( GI .2 P = 2.1 × 10-12). HuNoVs are highly prevalent in Ugandan children , indicating a substantial burden of diarrhea-associated morbidity with recurrent infections. Public health interventions , including vaccination , and increased surveillance are urgently needed.
