  The accuracy of a phenotypic scheme to recognize periodontal Prevotella<pathogen> intermedia/nigrescens group clinical isolates on primary isolation culture plates was assessed with matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( MALDI-TOF MS). A total of 84 fresh subgingival isolates from 23 chronic periodontitis<disease> patients were presumptively recognized on anaerobically-incubated enriched Brucella blood agar primary isolation plates as P. intermedia/nigrescens based on their dark-pigmented colony morphology , brick-red autofluorescence under long-wave ultraviolet light , and a negative fluorescence test for lactose production. The presumptive P. intermedia/nigrescens clinical isolates were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis using Bruker MALDI Biotyper analytic software containing mass spectra for P.<pathogen> intermedia<pathogen> and Prevotella<pathogen> nigrescens<pathogen> in its reference library of bacterial protein profiles. Using a â‰¥ 1.7 log score agreement threshold , 60 ( 71.4 %) of the presumptive P. intermedia/nigrescens clinical isolates were confirmed as either P.<pathogen> intermedia<pathogen> ( 25 isolates) or P.<pathogen> nigrescens<pathogen> ( 35 isolates). All isolates with a < 1.7 log score were also identified as P.<pathogen> intermedia<pathogen> or P.<pathogen> nigrescens<pathogen> from the top choice designated on the MALDI Biotyper most likely species identification list. These MALDI-TOF MS findings document the ability of the phenotypic scheme to correctly recognize most periodontal P. intermedia/nigrescens group clinical isolates on primary isolation culture plates.
