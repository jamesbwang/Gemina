  Adherence , invasion , and translocation to and through the intestinal epithelium are important drivers of disease for many enteric bacteria. However , most work has been limited to transformed intestinal cell lines or murine models that often do not faithfully recapitulate key elements associated with human<disease> disease<disease>. The recent technological advances in organotypic tissue and cell culture are providing unparalleled access to systems with human physiology and complexity. Human intestinal enteroids ( HIEs) , derived from patient biopsy or surgical specimens of intestinal tissues , are organotypic cultures now being adapted to the study of enteric<disease> infections<disease>. HIEs are comprised of the dominant cell types of the human gastrointestinal epithelium , can be grown in two- or three-dimensional structures , form a crypt-villus axis with defined apical and basolateral compartments , and undergo physiologic responses to many different stimuli. Here , we describe a series of protocols that encompass the use of human enteroids for the measurement of the adherence , invasion , and translocation of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> to and through the intestinal epithelium. We also outline the steps needed to grow and prepare enteroids for this purpose and highlight some common problems to troubleshoot. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
