  Vibrio<pathogen> vulnificus<pathogen> is a gram-negative bacterium<pathogen> that can cause serious , potentially fatal infections. V.<pathogen> vulnificus<pathogen> causes three distinct syndromes<disease>: an overwhelming primary septicemia<disease> caused by consuming contaminated seafood , wound<disease> infections<disease> acquired when an open wound<disease> is exposed to contaminated warm seawater , and gastrointestinal tract-limited infections. Case-fatality rates are higher than 50 % for primary septicemia<disease> , and death typically occurs within 72 hours of hospitalization. Risk factors for V.<pathogen> vulnificus<pathogen> infection include chronic liver disease , alcoholism , and hematological disorders. When V.<pathogen> vulnificus<pathogen> infection is suspected , appropriate antibiotic treatment and surgical interventions should be performed immediately. Third-generation cephalosporin with doxycycline , or quinolone with or without third-generation cephalosporin , may be potential treatment options for patients with V.<pathogen> vulnificus<pathogen> infection.
