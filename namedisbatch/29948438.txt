  This report describes a case of invasive Exophiala<pathogen> dermatitidis<pathogen> infection after double lung transplantation in a 76-year-old man. After thoracotomy , the patient 's wound<disease> showed dehiscence with purulent secretion. The black yeast was isolated from cultures taken from the wound<disease> , and species identification was confirmed by sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer ( ITS-S2) region. The results of the susceptibility testing showed voriconazole as the most active drug. Despite adaptation of the antifungal therapy the clinical condition worsened , and the patient died. In addition , we evaluated the fungicidal activity of antiseptics towards E.<pathogen> dermatitidis<pathogen> and aimed to provide a brief literature review of previously reported infections caused by this rare fungus. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of a rapidly progressing invasive fungal infection with E dermatitidis originating from a colonized wound<disease> after lung transplantation.
