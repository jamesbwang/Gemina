  Directly-acting antivirals ( DAA) have changed the chronic hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection therapeutic scenario allowing virus eradication in more than 95 % of patients , independently from the genotype , with 12 to 24-week treatment regimens. We describe a 51-year-old Pakistani man with a chronic HCV-genotype 3 ( GT3a) infection with moderate liver fibrosis<disease> , who achieved sustained virological response ( SVR) 24 after a tripled dose of Daclatasvir ( DCV) taken erroneously associated to Sofosbuvir ( SOF). The patient had a concomitant intestinal TB infection whose treatment had been delayed in order to firstly eradicate HCV<pathogen> to reduce the liver toxicity of anti-mycobacterial drugs. Thanks to the cultural mediator support , we explained to the patient the correct posology of each drug to take during the day consisting of 12 week SOF ( 400 mg daily) plus DCV ( 60 mg daily) regimen. He returned 13 days after for a programmed visit and we were surprised to learn that he had taken 3 pills of DCV ( 180 mg/daily) instead of one , thus ending DCV assumption after only 9 days while SOF was taken correctly. He complained no symptoms. We immediately performed blood test that showed alteration of lactate dehydrogenase , creatine phosphokinase , and creatin kinase MB activity. At day 15 we stopped SOF closely monitoring the patient. Blood test alterations returned normal after one week of treatment suspension , HCV<pathogen> viremia remained suppressed after 4 , 12 and 24 weeks proving HCV<pathogen> eradication. If confirmed , these data could suggest that higher doses of DCV , if tolerated , might be employed in short-time HCV-GT3 treatment.
