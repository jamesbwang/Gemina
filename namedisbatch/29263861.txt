  Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) , a mosquito-borne flavivirus<pathogen> , was first identified in the 1940s in Uganda in Africa and emerged in the Americas in Brazil in May 2015. In the 30 months since ZIKV emerged as a major public health problem , spectacular progress has been made with vaccine development cumulating with the publication of three reports of phase 1 clinical trials in the 4th quarter of 2017. Clinical trials involving candidate DNA and purified inactivated virus vaccines showed all were safe and well-tolerated in the small number of volunteers and all induced neutralizing antibodies , although these varied by vaccine candidate and dosing regimen. These results suggest that a Zika<disease> vaccine can be developed and that phase 2 clinical trials are warranted. However , it is difficult to compare the results from the different phase 1 studies or with neutralizing antibodies induced by licensed flavivirus<pathogen> vaccines ( Japanese<disease> encephalitis<disease> , tick-borne<disease> encephalitis<disease> , and yellow<disease> fever<disease> as neutralizing antibody assays vary and , unfortunately , there are no standards for Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> neutralizing antibodies. In addition to clinical studies , substantial progress continues to be made in nonclinical development , particularly in terms of the ability of candidate vaccines to protect reproductive tissues , and the potential use of monoclonal antibodies for passive prophylaxis.
