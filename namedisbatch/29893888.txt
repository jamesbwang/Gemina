  In this study , we investigated immune responses induced by purified Ebola<disease> virus ( EBOV<pathogen>) soluble glycoprotein ( sGP) subunit vaccines via intradermal immunization with microneedle ( MN) patches in comparison with intramuscular ( IM) injection in mice. Our results showed that MN delivery of EBOV<pathogen> sGP was superior to IM injection in eliciting higher levels and longer lasting antibody responses against EBOV<pathogen> sGP and GP antigens. Moreover , sGP-specific immune responses induced by MN or IM immunizations were effectively augmented by formulating sGP with a saponin-based adjuvant , and they were shown to confer complete protection of mice against lethal mouse-adapted EBOV<pathogen> ( MA-EBOV) challenge. In comparison , mice that received sGP without adjuvant by MN or IM immunizations succumbed to lethal MA-EBOV challenge. These results show that immunization with EBOV<pathogen> sGP subunit vaccines with adjuvant by MN patches , which have been shown to provide improved safety and thermal stability , is a promising approach to protect against EBOV infection.
