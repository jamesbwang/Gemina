  Dermatophytes comprise pathogenic fungi<pathogen> that have a high affinity for the keratinized structures present in nails , skin , and hair , causing superficial<disease> infections<disease> known as dermatophytosis<disease> A reasonable number of antifungal drugs currently exist on the pharmaceutical market to control mycoses; however , their cellular targets are restricted , and fungi<pathogen> may exhibit tolerance or resistance to these agents. For example , the stress caused by antifungal and cytotoxic drugs in sub-inhibitory concentrations promotes compensatory stress responses , with the over-expression of genes involved in cellular detoxification , drug efflux , and signaling pathways being among the various mechanisms that may contribute to drug tolerance. In addition , the ATP-binding cassette transporters in dermatophytes that are responsible for cellular efflux can act synergistically , allowing one to compensate for the absence of the other , revealing the complexity of drug tolerance phenomena. Moreover , mutations in genes coding for target enzymes could lead to substitutions in amino acids involved in the binding of antifungal agents , hindering their performance and leading to treatment failure. The relevance of each one of these mechanisms of resistance to fungal survival is hard to define , mainly because they can act simultaneously in the cell. However , an understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the resistance/tolerance processes , the identification of new antifungal targets , as well as the prospective of new antifungal compounds among natural or synthetic products , are expected to bring advances and new insights that facilitate the improvement or development of novel strategies for antifungal therapy.
