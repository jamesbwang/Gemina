  Anthrax<disease> is an important disease caused by the bacterium<pathogen> Bacillus<pathogen> anthracis<pathogen> affecting both domestic and wild animals at the wildlife/livestock interface , defined here as a physical space in which wild and domestic species overlap in range and potentially interact. In endemic regions , sporadic anthrax<disease> outbreaks occur , causing significant deaths of both wildlife and livestock and sporadically , humans. However , it may also occur as isolated outbreaks with a few animals affected. Such isolated anthrax<disease> outbreaks maybe missed. High seroprevalence among carnivores suggests either regular non-fatal exposure to the pathogen circulating in a given environment , or contact with missed cases through consumption of anthrax<disease> carcases. To investigate the relevance of this potential indicator , a cross-sectional study was conducted to determine anthrax<disease> seroprevalence in domestic dogs ( Canis<pathogen> lupus familiaris) from selected interface and non-interface areas of Zimbabwe with known history of anthrax<disease> outbreaks. Based on past anthrax<disease> outbreaks in the respective areas , the sites were further classified as high or low risk areas for anthrax<disease> outbreaks. Sera were collected from domestic dogs ( n = 186) and tested for antibodies against B.<pathogen> anthracis<pathogen> protective antigens ( PA) using an ELISA test. The overall seroprevalence was 51.6 % ( 96/186; 95 % CI 44.2-59.0). Sites from the non-interface areas recorded a significantly ( P < 0.001) higher ( 72.1 %) anthrax<disease> seroprevalence compared with those from the wildlife- livestock interface ( 41.5 %). The results demonstrated a strong association ( Ï‡2 = 14.3; OR = 3.2 , 1.6 < OR < 6.2 , P < 0.001) between anthrax<disease> seropositivity and interface type. Low-risk sites ( 42.5 %) had a significantly ( P = 0.044) lower seroprevalence compared with high-risk sites ( 58.5 %) but still demonstrated high seroprevalence for areas where anthrax<disease> was last reported more than 20 years back. Dogs from Tsholotsho South were more than 90-times ( OR = 96.5 , 13.5 < OR < 690.8) more likely to be seropositive compared with those from Hwange. The study demonstrated the potential to use domestic dogs as indicators of anthrax<disease> in the study areas to survey anthrax<disease> circulation in supposed low-risk areas and calls for a redefinition of both low and high risk areas for anthrax<disease> in Zimbabwe based on an improved surveillance.
