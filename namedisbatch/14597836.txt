  The aim of this study was to examine sex disparity in metabolic syndrome<disease> prevalence and its risk factors among Chinese adults. Using the 2010-2012 China National Nutrition and Health Survey ( CNNHS) , a nationally representative cross-sectional study on nutrition and non-communicable chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , a total of 98,042 participants aged 18 years and older were included in the analysis. Dietary information was collected with a food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ). Metabolic syndrome<disease> was defined according to the updated NCEP ATP III criteria. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to examine the associations between sociodemographic and dietary factors with metabolic syndrome<disease> prevalence , and the results are presented using odd ratios ( ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). The overall standardized prevalence of metabolic syndrome<disease> was 24.2 % ( 24.6 % in men and 23.8 % in women). The metabolic syndrome<disease> prevalence was positively associated with age in men and women. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome<disease> was negatively associated with the physical activity level among men and inversely associated with the education level among women ( P for trend < 0.01). Frequent consumption of fungi<pathogen> and algae<pathogen> was an underlying risk factor for metabolic syndrome<disease> in men , whereas frequent consumption of nuts and pork was associated with a decreased prevalence of metabolic syndrome<disease> in women. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome<disease> in men was not different from that in women. There are sex-specific associations between multiple risk factors and metabolic
