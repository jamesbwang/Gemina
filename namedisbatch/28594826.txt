  Vibrio<pathogen> cholerae<pathogen> , the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera<disease> , is antagonized by the lytic phage ICP1 in the aquatic environment and in human hosts. Mobile genetic elements called PLEs ( phage-inducible chromosomal island-like elements) protect V.<pathogen> cholerae<disease> from ICP1 infection and initiate their anti-phage response by excising from the chromosome. Here , we show that PLE 1 encodes a large serine recombinase , Int , that exploits an ICP1-specific protein as a recombination directionality factor ( RDF) to excise PLE 1 in response to phage infection. We show that this phage-encoded protein is sufficient to direct Int-mediated recombination in vitro and that it is highly conserved in all sequenced ICP1 genomes. Our results uncover an aspect of the molecular specificity underlying the conflict between a single predatory phage and V.<pathogen> cholerae<disease> PLE and contribute to our understanding of long-term evolution between phage and their bacterial hosts.
