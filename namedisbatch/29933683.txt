  The present study was designed to investigate the effect of cultivated Cordyceps<pathogen> sinensis<pathogen> ( CCS) on leukemia-derived K562 cells , and further explore the underlying mechanisms. After routine culture of K562 cells , MTT assay was used to detect the effect of CCS on survivel of human leukemia<disease> cell lines K562; DAPI staining was used to observe the morphological changes of the nucleus and AO/EB staining was used to observe cell apoptosis. JC-1 staining was employed to detect the changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Flow cytometry ( FCM) was used to detect cell cycle distribution , and Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression levels of Bax , Bcl-2 , caspase 3 , caspase 8 , cyclin D1 , CDK2 , and CDK4 in K562 cells. The results showed that CCS ( 0.345-5.524 g · L ⁻¹) substantially suppressed proliferation of K562 cells and induced G ₁/ S phase arrest in a dose-dependent manner. DAPI and AO/EB staining indicated that cell apoptosis was significantly induced by CCS treatment , accompanied by decreased mitochondrial membrane potential demonstrated by JC-1 staining. Western blot results showed that CCS significantly increased the expression of Bax and , meanwhile , decreased the expression levels of Bcl-2 , cyclin D1 , CDK2 , CDK4 , caspase 3 and caspase 8. Collectively , our data demonstrated that CCS dose-dependently suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in K562 cells , and the mechanism might be associated with inducing cell cycle arrest , regulating Bcl-2/ Bax ratio and activating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.
