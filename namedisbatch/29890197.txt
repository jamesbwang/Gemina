  Complement component 1q ( C1q) is the initial protein of the classical complement pathway and plays an important role in immune response against bacterial infection. In this study , the full-length of C1q subcomponent A , B and C chain genes ( C1qA , C1qB and C1qC) were identified and characterized from Nile<disease> tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus). Molecular characterization of these three C1q subcomponents ( OnC1qs) harbored conserved amino acids through analyses of multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree , which were homologous to other teleost species. Expression analysis revealed that the OnC1qs were highly expressed in liver. After the in vivo challenges of Streptococcus<pathogen> agalactiae<pathogen> and LPS , the mRNA expressions of OnC1qs were significantly up-regulated in liver. Meanwhile , the concentration variation of OnC1qs at the protein level from tilapia serum after challenge with S.<pathogen> agalactiae<pathogen> were measured by a competitive-inhibition ELISA. In addition , the up-regulation expressions of OnC1qs were also demonstrated in head kidney adherent leukocytes and the cell culture medium in vitro stimulation with S.<pathogen> agalactiae<pathogen> , Aeromonas<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> and LPS , respectively. Moreover , the recombinant OnC1qs enhanced expression of cytokines IL-6 , IL-8 and IL-10 in head kidney adherent leukocytes , and were able to bind both heat-aggregated mouse IgG and IgM. Taken together , the results of this study indicated that OnC1qs might be involved in host defense against bacterial infection in Nile tilapia.
