  Human<pathogen> adenovirus<pathogen> type 55 ( HAdV-B55) is a recently identified acute<disease> respiratory<disease> disease<disease> ( ARD) pathogen in HAdV species B with a recombinant genome between renal HAdV-B11 and respiratory HAdV-B14. Since HAdV-B55 first appeared in China school in 2006 , no more ARD cases associated with it had been reported until 2011 , when there was an outbreak of adult severe community-acquired pneumonia<disease> ( CAP) in Beijing , China. Reported here is the bioinformatics analysis of the re-emergent HAdV-B55 responsible for this outbreak. Recombination and protein sequence analysis re-confirmed that this isolate ( BJ01) was a recombinant virus with the capsid hexon gene from HAdV-B11. The selection pressures for the three capsid proteins ,
