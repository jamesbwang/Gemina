  Combined daclatasvir ( DCV)/ asunaprevir ( ASV) plus beclabuvir ( BCV) treatment shows a high virological response for genotype 1b chronic hepatitis<disease> C<disease> patients. However , its efficacy for patients for whom previous direct-acting antiviral ( DAA) therapy failed is not known. We analysed the efficacy of DCV/ASV/BCV treatment for HCV-infected mice and chronic hepatitis<disease> patients. Human hepatocyte chimaeric mice were injected with serum samples obtained from either a DAA-na誰ve patient or a DCV/ASV treatment failure and were then treated with DCV/ASV alone or in combination with BCV for 4 weeks. DCV/ASV treatment successfully eliminated the virus in DAA-na誰ve-patient HCV-infected mice. DCV/ASV treatment failure HCV-infected mice developed viral breakthrough during DCV/ASV treatment , with the emergence of NS5A-L31V/ Y93H HCV<pathogen> resistance-associated variants ( RAVs) being observed by direct sequencing. DCV/ASV/BCV treatment inhibited viral breakthrough in NS5A-L31V/ Y93H-mutated HCV-infected mice , but HCV<pathogen> relapsed with the emergence of NS5B-P495S variants after the cessation of the treatment. The efficacy of the triple therapy was also analysed in HCV-infected patients; one DAA-na誰ve patient and four prior DAA treatment failures were treated with 12 weeks of DCV/ASV/BCV therapy. Sustained virological response was achieved in a DAA-na誰ve patient and one of the DCV/ASV treatment failures through DCV/ASV/BCV therapy; however , HCV<pathogen> relapse occurred in the other patients with prior DCV/ASV and/or sofosbuvir/ledipasvir treatment failures. DCV/ASV/BCV therapy seems to have limited efficacy for patients with NS5A RAVs for whom prior DAA treatment has failed.
