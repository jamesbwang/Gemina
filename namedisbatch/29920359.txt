  Brown seaweed is a common food for Asians , and the bioactive ingredient fucoxanthin exerts anti-apoptotic activities in several cell types. Renal tubular cell apoptosis is one of the common cellular events leading to renal fibrosis<disease> and chronic kidney disease ( CKD). However , the influence of fucoxanthin-containing brown seaweed extract on CKD is still unknown. We intended to evaluate the inhibitory effect of fucoxanthin-containing extract from brown seaweed on renal apoptosis under CKD condition and its molecular mechanism. The fucoxanthin-containing brown seaweed extract ( LJE) was prepared from Laminaria japonica<pathogen>. We investigated how LJE influences on both doxorubicin-treated rat renal tubular cells ( NRK-52E) and the renal symptoms of nephrectomy-induced CKD mice. LJE inhibited doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and upregulated Na We demonstrated that LJE inhibits renal apoptosis via NHE1 upregulation. The anti-apoptotic effect of LJE also improves renal function in CKD mice. Therefore , fucoxanthin-containing brown seaweed may have a therapeutic potential for CKD patients.
