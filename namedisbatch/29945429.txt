  The purpose of this study was to determine the key components of Korean disaster psychiatric assistant teams ( K-DPATs) , to set up new mental health service providing system for the disaster victims. We conducted an analytic hierarchy process ( AHP) involving disaster mental health experts , using a pairwise comparison questionnaire to compare the relative importance of the key components of the Korean disaster mental health response system. In total , 41 experts completed the first online survey; of these , 36 completed the second survey. Ten experts participated in panel meetings and discussed the results of the survey and AHP process. It was agreed that K-DPATs should be independent of the existing mental health system ( 70.1 %) , funding for K-DPATs should be provided by the Ministry of Public Safety , and the system should be managed by the Ministry of Health ( 65.8 %).

K-DPAT , a new model for disaster mental health response systems could improve the insufficiency of the current system , address problems such as fragmentation , and fulfill disaster victims ' unmet need for early professional intervention.
