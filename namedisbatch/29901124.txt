  Familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP) , an autosomal dominant disease , is a colon cancer predisposition syndrome<disease> that manifests as a large number of adenomatous polyps. Mutations in the Adenomatous polyposis coli<pathogen> ( APC) gene are responsible for the majority of cases of FAP. The purpose of the present study was to report the clinical features of a Chinese family with FAP and screen for novel mutations using the targeted next‑generation sequencing technology. Among the 29 family members , 12 were diagnosed of FAP. Based on an established filtering strategy and data analyses , along with confirmation by Sanger sequencing and co‑segregation , a novel frameshift mutation c. 1317delA ( p.Ala440LeufsTer14) in exon 10 of the APC gene was identified. To the best of our knowledge , this mutation has not been reported prior to the present study. In addition , it was correlated with extra‑colonic phenotypes featuring duodenal polyposis and sebaceous<disease> cysts<disease> in this family. This novel frameshift mutation causing FAP not only expands the germline mutation spectrum of the APC gene in the Chinese population , but it also increases the understanding of the phenotypic and genotypic correlations of FAP , and may potentially lead to improved genetic counseling and specific treatment for families with FAP in the future.
