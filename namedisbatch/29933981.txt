  Fusarium<pathogen> oxysporum<pathogen> ( Fo) is an important genus of filamentous fungi<pathogen> that causes many devastating diseases of agronomical plants and some opportunistic<disease> diseases<disease> of humans. Previous studies have indicated that mutations in myosin5 acquired resistance to phenamacril in Fusarium<pathogen> graminearum ( Fg). Here , we need to determine the residues of FoMyo5 involved in the natural resistance of plant pathogenic Fo strains. Six kinds of Fo reference strains from different hosts were studied. Fungicide susceptibility testing showed that these Fo strains demonstrated different resistance or susceptibility to phenamacril , which is Fusarium-specific antifungal compound , compared with Fg species. When aligned these homologous myosin5 motor domains of these strains , we found that the substitutions ( Val
