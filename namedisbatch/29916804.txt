  Anti-microbial compounds typically exert their action by directly interfering with one or more stages of the pathogen 's life cycle. However , some compounds also have secondary effects on the host that aid in pathogen clearance. Raltegravir is a human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>)- integrase inhibitor that has been shown to alter the host immune response to HIV<pathogen> in addition to its direct antiviral effect. Interestingly , raltegravir can also directly inhibit the replication of various herpesviruses. However , the host-targeted effects of this drug in the context of a herpesvirus<pathogen> infection have not been explored. Here , we used felid alphaherpesvirus<pathogen> 1 ( FHV-1) , a close relative of human<pathogen> alphaherpesvirus<pathogen> 1 ( HHV-1) that similarly causes ocular herpes<disease> , to characterize the host-targeted effects of raltegravir on corneal epithelial cells during an alphaherpesvirus<pathogen> infection. Using RNA deep sequencing , we found that raltegravir specifically boosts the expression of anti-angiogenic factors and promotes metabolic homeostasis in FHV-1-infected cells. In contrast , few changes in host gene transcription were found in uninfected cells. Importantly , we were able to demonstrate that these effects were specific to raltegravir and independent of the direct-acting antiviral effect of the drug , since treatment with the DNA polymerase inhibitor phosphonoacetic acid did not induce these host-targeted effects. Taken together , these results indicate that raltegravir has profound and specific effects on the host transcription profile of herpesvirus-infected cells that may contribute to the overall antiviral activity of the drug and could provide therapeutic benefits in vivo. Furthermore , this study provides a framework for future efforts evaluating the host-targeted effects of anti-microbial compounds.
