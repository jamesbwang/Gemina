  Controlled human<disease> infection<disease> ( CHI) trials , in which healthy volunteers are experimentally infected , can accelerate the development of novel drugs and vaccines for infectious<disease> diseases<disease> of global importance. The use of CHI models is expanding from around 60 studies in the 1970s to more than 120 publications in this decade , primarily for influenza<disease> , rhinovirus<pathogen> , and malaria<disease> CHI trials have provided landmark data for several registered drugs and vaccines , and have generated unprecedented scientific insights. Because of their invasive nature , CHI studies demand critical ethical review according to established frameworks. CHI-associated serious adverse events are rarely reported. Novel CHI models need standardised safety data from comparable CHI models to facilitate evidence-based risk assessments , as well as funds to produce challenge inoculum according to regulatory requirements. Advances such as the principle of controlled colonisation , the expansion of models to endemic areas , and the use of genetically attenuated strains will further broaden the scope of CHI trials.
