  Leishmaniasis<disease> is a vector-borne disease caused by the protozoan Leishmania<pathogen> and it is one of the six most important infectious<disease> diseases<disease> in the world. The aim of this study was to conduct a research on the fauna and most frequented ecotopes by sandflies on islands of the Paraná River. The sandflies were collected with Falcão light traps in 10 islands in the municipalities of São Pedro do Paraná , Porto Rico , and Querência do Norte , in Paraná State , Brazil , from November 2012 to November 2014. In total , 76,145 specimens of Nyssomyia neivai , the only species found , were collected , of which 63,015 were female and 13,130 , male. The largest number of sandflies was collected mainly in domiciles and peridomiciles. The islands of the Paraná River showed predominance of Ny. neivai , which is largely involved in the transmission of Leishmania and a risk of human leishmaniasis<disease> to the island<disease> inhabitants and tourists.
