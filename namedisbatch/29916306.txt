  In recent years , there has been an universal increase in number of reports of infections involving non-O1<pathogen> , non-O139 V.<pathogen> cholerae<disease> ( NOVC). NOVC infection is only rarely complicated by septicaemia<disease> or invasive extra-intestinal infection. We report the first documented case of NOVC bacteraemia<disease> in a Belgian immunocompetent male after ingestion of water when paddling in a creek. Clinicians should include V.<pathogen> cholerae<disease> in their differential diagnosis in patients presenting with a self-limiting gastroenteritis<disease> after ingestion of raw and undercooked seafood or bathing in potentially contaminated recreational waters during warm summers.
