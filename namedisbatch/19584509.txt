  A total of 765 blood samples collected from dengue suspected patients admitted to a Teaching Hospital in Sri Lanka were used to compare a rapid ICT assay with a standard ELISA for the detection of anti-dengue virus ( DENV<pathogen>) IgM and IgG. Detection accuracy indices including sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( PPV) , negative predictive value ( NPV) , Chi square and Cohen 's kappa values were determined for the ICT assay using the ELISA as a comparator for the detection of anti-DENV IgM and IgG. The rapid ICT assay showed a sensitivity of 64 % , specificity of 75 % , NPV of 68 % and PPV of 72 % for anti-DENV IgM detection. However , all the accuracy indices were relatively higher for the anti-DENV IgG detection by the ICT assay than those for anti-DENV IgM detection. Despite the low sensitivity for anti-DENV IgM detection by the ICT assay , considering the limitations in using ELISAs in resource limited regions , rapid ICT assays would be useful for the detection of more recent DENV<pathogen> infections. As many patients present after fever<disease> days 5 in the study area , anti-DENV IgM/IgG would be the suitable marker to be detected by rapid ICT assays in such areas.
