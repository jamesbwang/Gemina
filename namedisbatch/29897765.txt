  Leishmaniasis<disease> , Chagas disease , and sleeping sickness affect millions of people worldwide and lead to the death of about 50000 humans per year. These diseases are caused by the kinetoplastids Leishmania<pathogen> , Trypanosoma cruzi , and Trypanosoma brucei , respectively. These parasites share many general features , including gene conservation , high amino acid identity among proteins , the presence of subcellular structures as glycosomes and the kinetoplastid , and genome architecture , that may make drug development family specific , rather than species-specific , i.e. , on the basis of the inhibition of a common , conserved parasite target. However , no optimal molecular targets or broad-spectrum drugs have been identified to date to cure these diseases. Here , the LeishBox from GlaxoSmithKline high-throughput screening , a 192-molecule set of best antileishmanial compounds , based on 1.8 million compounds , was used to identify specific inhibitors of a validated Leishmania<pathogen> target , trypanothione reductase ( TR) , while analyzing in parallel the homologous human enzyme glutathione reductase ( GR). We identified three specific highly potent TR inhibitors and performed docking on the TR solved structure , thereby elucidating the putative molecular basis of TR inhibition. Since TRs from kinetoplastids are well conserved , and these compounds inhibit the growth of Leishmania , Trypanosoma cruzi , and Trypanosoma brucei , the identification of a common validated target may lead to the development of potent antikinetoplastid drugs.
