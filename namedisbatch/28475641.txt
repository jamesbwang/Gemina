  Burkholderia<pathogen> pseudomallei<pathogen> is a flagellated Gram-negative bacterium<pathogen> which is the causative agent of melioidosis<disease> The disease poses a major public health problem in tropical regions and diabetes is a major risk factor. The high mortality rate of melioidosis<disease> is associated with severe sepsis<disease> which involves the overwhelming production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Bacterial flagellar protein ( flagellin) activates Toll-like receptor 5 ( TLR5)- mediated innate immune signaling pathways and induces adaptive immune response. However , previous studies of TLR5 signaling in melioidosis<disease> have been performed using recombinant flagellin from Salmonella<disease> Typhimurium<pathogen> instead of B.<pathogen> pseudomallei<pathogen>. This study aimed to investigate human innate immune response and antibody response against a recombinant B.<pathogen> pseudomallei<pathogen> flagellin ( rFliC). We prepared B.<pathogen> pseudomallei<pathogen> rFliC and used it to stimulate HEK-BlueTM-hTLR5 and THP1-DualTM cells to assess TLR5 activation. Subsequently , whole blood stimulation assays with rFliC were performed ex vivo. TLR5-flagellin interactions trigger activation of transcription factor NF-κB in HEK-BlueTM-hTLR5 cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokine ( IL-1β , IL-6 , and TNF-α) productions from whole blood in response to rFliC differed between fourteen healthy individuals. The levels of these cytokines changed in a dose and time-dependent manner. ELISA was used to determine rFliC-specific antibodies in serum samples from different groups of melioidosis<disease> patients and healthy subjects. IgG antibody to rFliC in melioidosis<disease> patients with diabetes were higher compared with non-diabetic patients. Our results show that B.<pathogen> pseudomallei<pathogen> flagellin is a potent immune stimulator and that the immune responses to rFliC are different among individuals. This may provide valuable insights toward the potential use of rFliC in vaccine development.
