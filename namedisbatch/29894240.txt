  Routine diagnostic laboratory results , e.g. numbers of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA) bacteraemias<disease> , have been used as health-care-associated infection quality indicators for decades. The English health-care-associated infection quality indicator system was one of the earliest in the world to mandate the collection and public reporting of such data and has been associated with a reduction of MRSA bacteraemias<disease> and Clostridium<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> infections but has shown mixed results for other infections. Diagnostic laboratory data vary greatly between hospitals depending not only on the underlying frequency of the infection of interest , but on the case mix , numbers of samples processed and laboratory factors , which limits benchmarking. Further , over-reliance on laboratory reports has led to unintended negative consequences in England. So , while acknowledging the successes of the English system , the authors believe that it should be appraised in light of the goals of quality of care , patient safety , fairness and providing meaningful data , and alternative healthcare-associated infection quality indicator measurements considered.
