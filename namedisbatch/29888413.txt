  Late-onset sepsis<disease> ( LOS) is a frequent and important cause of morbidity and mortality in newborn infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units ( NICUs). The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of various<disease> infection<disease> control quality measures introduced as a bundle on the trends of the LOS in a NICU. This was a prospective quality improvement study involving all neonates admitted to a NICU over a 15-year period between 2002 and 2016. The main focus areas of the bundle included collaborative team effort , hand hygiene , education , central line insertion and maintenance bundles and parenteral nutrition. The main outcome measures were LOS and central line-associated bloodstream infections. Yearly admissions increased during study period , from 776 in 2002 to 952 in 2016. There was a progressive decrease in LOS rate , from 4.3 to 1.6 per 1000 patient days ( B coefficient -0.17 , 95 % confidence interval -0.25 , -0.09; P < 0.001) , and the central line-associated bloodstream infection rate dropped from 25 in 2003 to 5 in 2016 per 1000 central line days ( B coefficient -1.20 , 95 % confidence interval -1.84 , -0.56; P = 0.001). Hand hygiene compliance rates remained consistent , over 80 %. During the study period , coagulase-negative staphylococcus<pathogen> caused 56 % and Gram-negative organisms 18 % of the total infections. Multifaceted infection control bundle practices with a concerted team effort in the implementation , with continuing education , feedback and reinforcement of best infection control practices , can sustain the gains achieved by infection control for a long period of time.
