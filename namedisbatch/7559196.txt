  Antibiotics with anaerobic coverage are widely used for the treatment of biliary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> ( BTI) , even in the absence of isolated anaerobes. The current study aimed to investigate the differences in clinical outcomes in patients with community-onset bacteremic BTIs without anaerobic bacteremia , treated with vs. without anti-anaerobic coverage. A retrospective analysis was conducted at a medical center in Taiwan from September 2014 to March 2016. Patients with community-onset bacteremic BTIs without anaerobic bacteremia and who were treated with appropriate antibiotics were analyzed. The clinical outcomes were compared between patients treated with and without anti-anaerobic coverage as definitive therapy after the blood culture reports were available. Multivariable and propensity score-adjusted analysis were used to identify the risk factors associated with treatment failure. Among the enrolled 87 patients , 63 and 24 patients were treated with and without anaerobic coverage , respectively. Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( 55.2 %) and Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> ( 23.0 %) were the most common organisms isolated from the blood cultures. The rate of treatment failure ( relapse and 28-day mortality) was similar between the groups with and without anaerobic coverage ( 20.6 % vs. 16.7 % , p = 0.677). Propensity score-adjusted multivariable analysis revealed that definitive therapy without anaerobic coverage was not a predisposing factor for treatment failure ( OR = 0.92 , 95 % CI 0.18-4.67 , p = 0.916). Definitive therapy without anaerobic coverage does not affect the outcomes of patients with community-onset bacteremic BTIs without anaerobes isolated from blood. Our results might provide a possible target for antibiotic stewardship interventions in BTIs.
