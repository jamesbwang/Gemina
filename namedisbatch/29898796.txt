  Outbreaks of Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis<disease> ( CL) have significantly increased due to the conflicts in the Middle<pathogen> East , with most of the cases occurring in resource-limited areas such as refugee settlements. The standard methods of diagnosis include microscopy and parasite culture , which have several limitations. To address the growing need for a CL diagnostic that can be field applicable , we have identified five candidate neoglycoproteins ( NGPs): Galα ( NGP3B) , Galα ( 1,3) Galα ( NGP17B) , Galα ( 1,3) Galβ ( NGP9B) , Galα ( 1,6) ( Galα ( 1,2)) Galβ ( NGP11B) , and Galα ( 1,3) Galβ ( 1,4) Glcβ ( NGP1B) that are differentially recognized in sera from individuals with Leishmania major infection as compared with sera from heterologous controls. These candidates contain terminal , non-reducing α-galactopyranosyl ( α-Gal) residues , which are known potent immunogens to humans. Logistic regression models found that NGP3B retained the best diagnostic potential ( area under the curve from receiver-operating characteristic curve = 0.8). Our data add to the growing body of work demonstrating the exploitability of the human anti-α-Gal response in CL diagnosis.
