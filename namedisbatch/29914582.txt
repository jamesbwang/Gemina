  Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 is the largest cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome<disease> ( HUS). Previous studies proposed that HUS risk varies across the E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 phylogenetic tree ( hypervirulent clade 8) , but the role of age in the association is unknown. We determined phylogenetic lineage of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 isolates from 1160 culture-confirmed E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 cases reported in Washington State , 2004-2015. Using generalised estimating equations , we tested the association between phylogenetic lineage and HUS. Age was evaluated as an effect modifier. Among 1082 E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 cases with both phylogenetic lineage and HUS status ( HUS n = 76) , stratified analysis suggested effect modification by age. Lineages IIa and IIb , relative to Ib , did not appear associated with HUS in children 0-9-years-old. For cases 10-59-years-old , lineages IIa and IIb appeared to confer increased risk of HUS , relative to lineage Ib. The association reversed in ⩾ 60-year-olds. Results were similar for clade 8. Phylogenetic lineage appears to be associated with HUS risk only among those ⩾ 10-years-old. Among children < 10 , the age group most frequently affected , lineage does not explain progression to HUS. However , lineage frequency varied across age groups , suggesting differences in exposure and/or early disease manifestation.
