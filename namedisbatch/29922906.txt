  The evolutionarily conserved Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 ( MRX) complex<pathogen> cooperates with the Sae2 protein in initiating resection of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs) and in maintaining the DSB ends tethered to each other for their accurate repair. How these MRX-Sae2 functions contribute to DNA damage resistance is not understood. By taking advantage of mre11 alleles that suppress the hypersensitivity<disease> of sae2 âˆ† cells to genotoxic agents , we have recently found that Mre11 can be divided in two structurally distinct domains that support resistance to genotoxic agents by mediating different processes. While the Mre11 N-terminal domain impacts on the resection activity of long-range resection nucleases by mediating MRX and Tel1/ATM association to DNA DSBs , the C-terminus influences the MRX-tethering activity by its virtue to interact with Rad50. Given the evolutionary conservation of the MRX complex , our results have implications for understanding the consequences of its dysfunctions in
