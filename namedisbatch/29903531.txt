  To assess the prevalence and severity of nonalcoholic liver disease ( NAFLD) in children in a diverse population sample in New<pathogen> York City. Liver specimens were examined from children 2-19 years old who died of unexpected causes within 48 hours of medical presentation and underwent autopsy in New<pathogen> York City from 2005 to 2010. Records were reviewed for age , sex , weight , height , and race. Two hepatopathologists evaluated each liver specimen to determine pathologic diagnosis. The final study cohort ( n = 582) was 50 % black , 33 % Hispanic , 12 % white , 3 % Asian , and 2 % other; 36 % had a body mass index > 85 %. There were 26 cases of NAFLD ( 4.5 %) of which 10 had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( 1.7 %). There were no cases with severe fibrosis<disease> or cirrhosis. One percent ( 3/290) of black children had NAFLD and none had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. White and Hispanic children had the highest percentages of NAFLD at 8.3 % and 7.9 % , respectively. In multiple logistic regression models , we observed that body mass index z-score ( P < .001) was associated with NAFLD , and that white ( P = .003) and Hispanic ( P = .005) children had higher odds of having NAFLD compared with black children. This review of liver tissue demonstrates a lower prevalence and severity of NAFLD in black children compared with the general obese pediatric population. Hispanic children did not have a significantly increased rate of NAFLD compared with white children , most likely related to the large proportion of Caribbean Hispanic children in New<pathogen> York City.
