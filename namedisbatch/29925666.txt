  Current approaches do not eliminate all HIV-1 maternal-to-infant transmissions ( MTIT); new prevention paradigms might help avert new infections. We administered Maraviroc ( MVC) to rhesus macaques ( RMs) to block CCR5-mediated entry , followed by repeated oral exposure of a CCR5-dependent clone of simian immunodeficiency<disease> virus<pathogen> ( SIV) mac251 ( SIVmac766). MVC significantly blocked the CCR5 coreceptor in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tissue cells. All control animals and 60 % of MVC-treated infant RMs became infected by the 6th challenge , with no significant difference between the number of exposures ( p = 0.15). At the time of viral exposures , MVC plasma and tissue ( including tonsil) concentrations were within the range seen in humans receiving MVC as a therapeutic. Both treated and control RMs were infected with only a single transmitted/founder variant , consistent with the dose of virus typical of HIV-1 infection. The uninfected RMs expressed the lowest levels of CCR5 on the CD4
