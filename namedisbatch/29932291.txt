  The aim of the study was to investigate whether the rs35761398 variants of the cannabinoid receptor 2 ( CB2) gene may influence the acquisition of HIV<pathogen> infection and the clinical presentation of HIV/hepatitis C virus<pathogen> ( HCV) coinfection. We compared 166 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with 186 HCV-monoinfected patients , all with biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis<disease> ( using the Ishak scoring system) , na√Øve for anti-HCV treatment and tested for the CB2 rs35761398 polymorphism ( using the TaqMan assay). The HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were more frequently male ( P < 0.002) , were younger ( P < 0.001) , and had lower median BMI ( P < 0.001) and HCV<pathogen> RNA ( P < 0.05) and higher median aspartate aminotransferase ( AST; P < 0.001) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT; P < 0.001) and gamma glutamyl transferase ( GGT; P < 0.001) levels than the HCV-monoinfected patients. The CB2 RR variant predominated in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients ( 45.8 % vs. 31.2 % in HCV-monoinfected patients; P < 0.001) and the CB2 QR variant in HCV-monoinfected patients ( 57.5 % vs. 38.6 % in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients; P < 0.00001) , and the CB2 QQ variant was equally distributed. Focusing on patients with the CB2 QQ variant , the 26 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients , compared with the 21 HCV-monoinfected patients , showed less severe liver necroinflammation ( lower histological activity index ( HAI)) ( P < 0.05). Of the patients with the CB2 RR variant , the 76 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients , compared with the 58 HCV-monoinfected patients , were more frequently male ( P < 0.05) , were younger ( P < 0.001) , and had a lower median body mass index ( BMI; P < 0.001) , a higher median AST level ( P < 0.001) , a higher mean HAI score ( P < 0.05) and a higher rate of cases with severe steatosis ( P = 0.05). In an analysis of variance ( anova) of HCV/HIV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected patient data , those with the CB2 RR variant ( P = 0.003) and of male sex ( P = 0.002) were more prevalent in the HCV/HIV-coinfected group. There is the suggestion of a positive effect of the CB2 RR variant on HIV<pathogen> acquisition and/or spread , which is in accordance with previous in vitro observations.
