  Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that exposure to particulate matter ambient pollution has adverse effects on lung health , exacerbated by cigarette smoking. Fine air-borne particles < 2.5 μm ( PM2 .5) are among the most harmful urban pollutants , and are closely linked to respiratory<disease> disease<disease>. Based on the knowledge that the small airway epithelium ( SAE) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of smoking-related lung disease , we hypothesized that elevated PM2 .5 levels are associated with dysregulation of SAE gene expression. From 2009-2012 , healthy nonsmoker ( n = 29) and smoker ( n = 129) residents of New<pathogen> York City ( NYC) underwent bronchoscopy with SAE brushing ( 2.6 ± 1.3 samples/subject , total of 405 samples). SAE gene expression was assessed by Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarray. NYC PM2 .5 levels ( Environmental Protection Agency data) were averaged for the 30 days prior to bronchoscopy. A linear mixed model was used to assess PM2.5-related gene dysregulation accounting for multiple clinical and methodologic variables with multiple test correction to assess significance. Thirty-day mean PM2 .5 levels varied from 6.2-18 µg/m3. In nonsmokers , there was no dysregulation of SAE gene expression associated with ambient PM2 .5 levels. In marked contrast , n = 219 genes were significantly dysregulated in association with PM2 .5 levels in the SAE of smokers. Many of these genes relate to cell growth and transcription regulation. Interestingly , 11 % of genes were mitochondria-associated. PM2 .5 exposure contributes to significant dysregulation of the SAE transcriptome of smokers , linking pollution and airway epithelial biology in the risk of development of respiratory<disease> disease<disease> in susceptible individuals.
