  Apoptosis , a significant form of cell death , has a leading role in the host cell defense against virus infection. Viruses have evolved a series of strategies that block apoptosis during the early stage of viral<disease> infection<disease> to enhance viral replication , and induce apoptosis in the late stages to facilitate viral particle release from the cells. Here we show that orf<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ORFV) , the causative agent of orf<pathogen> , encodes an apoptosis-inducing protein ORFV119. ORFV119 targets the mitochondria in host cells , inhibits cell proliferation , and induces cell apoptosis. Protein array data indicated that ORFV119 could induce apoptosis via up-regulation of Smac , Bak , and Bax and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and cIAP-2. Activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 , and consequent PARP cleavage , ultimately lead to apoptosis. ORFV119 could also directly activate caspase-8 and induce Bid , involved in the extrinsic pathway , to achieve cell death. Furthermore , sequence analysis and experiments with mutants of ORFV119 introduced revealed that ORFV119 contains a key N-terminal domain that is necessary and sufficient to direct the protein to the mitochondria. Together , we report , for the first time , the identification of the novel apoptosis-inducing protein ORFV119 encoded by a parapoxvirus. This provides an important reference for the study of pathogenesis , identification of immunomodulation mechanisms of ORFV , and may lead to new strategies for orf<pathogen> disease control.
