  HIV<pathogen> infection remains as a major challenge facing medical sciences in the world today. Mucocutaneous manifestation was first observed in patients with HIV/AIDS in the early 1980s. The aim of this study was to identify various skin manifestations based on making careful clinical observations and performing the necessary tests. A total of 240 patients whose disease was diagnosed using WB and ELISA tests , with dermatologic manifestations and were older than 18 years , participated in this study. These patients had referred to the voluntary counseling and testing center in Shiraz for routine examinations. From the total of 240 participants , 158 were males ( 65.8 %) and 82 were females ( 34.2 %). The mean age was 40.87 Â± 8.04 years. Dermatologic manifestations were of infectious origin in 79 ( 33 %) of the participants. As the most common viral skin<disease> infections<disease> , herpes<disease> simplex<disease> was seen in 16 patients ( 6.7 %) , with herpes<disease> zoster<disease> ranking second with 15 patients ( 6.3 %). No relationship was found between CD4 cell count and infectious or noninfectious dermatologic manifestations ( No association was found between CD4 cell counts and dermatologic manifestations. Many skin disorders may appear in HIV/AIDS patients with normal CD4 cell counts.
