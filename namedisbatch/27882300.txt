  Human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) causes immune dysregulation , potentially affecting response to vaccines in infected persons. We investigated if unexpected adverse events ( AEs) or unusual patterns of AEs after vaccination were reported among HIV-positive persons. We searched for domestic reports among HIV-positive persons to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS) during 1990-2016. We analyzed reports by age group ( < 19 and ≥ 19 years) , sex , serious or non-serious status , live vaccine type ( live versus inactivated) , AEs reported , and CD4 counts. Of 532,235 reports received , 353 ( 0.07 %) described HIV-positive persons , of whom 67 % were aged ≥ 19 years , and 57 % were male; most reports ( 75 %) were non-serious. The most commonly reported inactivated vaccines were pneumococcal polysaccharide ( 27 %) and inactivated influenza<disease> ( 27 %); the mostly reported common live virus vaccines were combination measles<pathogen> , mumps<disease> , and rubella<pathogen> ( 8 %) and varicella ( 6 %). Injection site reactions were commonly reported ( 39 %). Of 67 reports with CD4 counts available , 41 ( 61 %) described persons immunocompromised at time of vaccination ( CD4 count < 500 cells/mm3) , and differed from overall reports only in that varicella was the most common live virus vaccine ( 4 reports). Of 22 reports describing failure to protect against infection , 6 described persons immunocompromised at time of vaccination , among whom varicella vaccine was most common ( 3 reports). Of 66 reports describing live virus vaccines , 7 described persons with disseminated infection: 6 had disseminated varicella , 3 of whom had vaccine strain varicella-zoster virus. Of 18 reported deaths , 7 resulted from disseminated infection: 6 were among immunocompromised persons , 1 of whom had vaccine strain varicella-zoster virus. We identified no unexpected or unusual patterns of AEs among HIV-positive persons. These data reinforce current vaccine recommendations for this risk group. However , healthcare providers should know their HIV-positive patients ' immune status because immunocompromising conditions can potentially increase the risk of rare , but severe , AEs following vaccination with live virus vaccines.
