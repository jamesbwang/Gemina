  Considering the need for discovery of new antiviral drugs , in view to combat the issue of resistance particularly to anti-influenza drugs , a series of 2 '- amino , 3 '- amino and 2 ' , 4 '- dihydroxy chalcone derivatives were designed. Structure-based drug design was used to design inhibitors of influenza<disease> virus<pathogen>- H1N1<pathogen> neuraminidase enzyme. These were further optimized by a combination of iterative medicinal chemistry principles and molecular docking. Based on the best docking scores , some chalcone derivatives were synthesized and characterized by infrared spectroscopy ( IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR). The molecules were evaluated for their anti-influenza action against influenza<disease> A/Pune isolate/2009 ( H1N1<pathogen>) virus<pathogen> by in vitro enzyme-based assay ( neuraminidase inhibition assay). We have then selected few of them for multinuclear NMR studies , 31P NMR , in order to probe the molecular mechanism of their antiviral action. Reasonably good correlation between docking scores; anti-influenza activity; and 31P NMR results were observed. The computational predictions were in consensus with the experimental results. It was observed that among tested compounds , derivative 1A , viz. 2 ' , 4 '- dihydroxy-4-methoxy chalcone , showed highest activity ( IC50 = 2.23 Î¼mol/l) against the virus under study. This derivative 1A can be explored further to provide a future therapeutic option for the treatment and prophylaxis of
