  Vibrio<pathogen> cholera<disease> is a major contributor of diarrheal illness that causes significant morbidity and mortality globally. While there is literature on the health economics of diarrheal illnesses more generally , few studies have quantified the cost-of-illness and cost-effectiveness of cholera-specific prevention and control interventions. The present systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the literature specific to cholera<disease> as it pertains to key health economic measures. A systematic review was performed with no date restrictions up through February 2017 in PubMed , Econlit , Embase , Web of Science , and Cochrane Review to identify relevant health economics of cholera<disease> literature. After removing duplicates , a total of 1993 studies were screened and coded independently by two reviewers , resulting in 22 relevant studies. Data on population , methods , and results ( cost-of-illness and cost-effectiveness of vaccination) were compared by country/region. All costs were adjusted to 2017 USD for comparability. Costs per cholera<disease> case were found to be rather low: < $ 100 per case in most settings , even when costs incurred by patients/families and lost productivity are considered. When wider socioeconomic costs are included , estimated costs are > $ 1000/case. There is adequate evidence to support the economic value of vaccination for the prevention and control of cholera<disease> when vaccination is targeted at high-incidence populations and/or areas with high case fatality rates due to cholera<disease> When herd immunity is considered , vaccination also becomes a cost-effective option for the general population and is comparable in cost-effectiveness to other routine immunizations. Cholera<disease> vaccination is a viable short-to-medium term option , especially as the upfront costs of building water , sanitation , and hygiene ( WASH) infrastructure are considerably higher for countries that face a significant burden of cholera<disease> While WASH may be the more cost-effective solution in the long-term when implemented properly , cholera<disease> vaccination can still be a feasible , cost-effective strategy.
