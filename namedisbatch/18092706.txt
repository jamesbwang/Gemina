  Acute otitis<disease> media<disease> affects 700 million people each year with children being disproportionately affected relative to adults. Group A streptococcus<pathogen> is a pathogen implicated in a broad array of human pathology. It is , however , a rare cause of acute otitis<disease> media<disease> and neuroinvasive disease in older adults with only 2-3 cases occurring per year in the United States. We describe two such cases from a single institution in Rhode Island in 2017. The clinical presentation , neuroimaging and management are reviewed. The mechanism of intracranial spread may have involved dehiscence of the bony tegmen of the roof of the middle ear cavity.
