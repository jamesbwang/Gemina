  Media<pathogen> depictions and laws passed in state legislatures regulating abortion<disease> suggest abortion-related medical emergencies are common. An accurate understanding of abortion-related emergencies is important for informing policy and practice. We assessed the incidence of abortion-related emergency department ( ED) visits in the United States ( U.S.). We used a retrospective observational study design using 2009-2013 data from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample , a nationally representative sample of U.S. ED visits from 947 to 964 hospitals across the U.S. per year. All ED visits among women of reproductive age ( 15-49) were included. We categorized ED visits by abortion<disease> relatedness and treatments received , and assessed whether the visit was for a major incident ( defined as requiring blood transfusion , surgery , or overnight inpatient stay). We estimated the proportion of visits that were abortion-related and described the characteristics of patients making these visits , the diagnoses and subsequent treatments received by these patients , the sociodemographic and hospital characteristics associated with the incidents and observation care only ( defined as receiving no treatments) , and the rate of major incidents for all abortion<disease> patients in the U.S. Among all ED visits by women aged 15-49 ( 189,480,685) , 0.01 % ( n = 27,941) were abortion-related. Of these visits , 51 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 95 % CI 49.3-51.9 %) of the women received observation care only. A total of 20 % ( 95 % CI 19.3-21.3 %) of abortion-related ED visits were for major incidents. One-fifth ( 22 % , 95 % CI 20.9-23.0 %) of abortion-related visits resulted in admission to the same hospital for abortion-related reasons. Of the visits , 1.4 % ( n = 390 , 95 % CI 1.1-1.7 %) were potentially due to attempts at self-induced abortion<disease> In multivariable models , women using Medicaid ( adjusted odds ratio , AOR 1.28 , 95 % CI 1.08-1.52) and women with a comorbid condition ( AORs 2.47-4.63) had higher odds of having a major incident than women using private insurance and those without comorbid conditions. During the study period , 0.11 % of all abortions<disease> in the U.S. resulted in major incidents as seen in EDs. Abortion-related ED visits comprise a small proportion of women 's ED visits. Many abortion-related ED visits may not be indicated or could have been managed at a less costly level of care. Given the low rate of major incidents , perceptions that abortion<disease> is unsafe are not based on evidence.
