  Nipah<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( NiV) is a highly pathogenic zoonotic paramyxovirus<pathogen> that can result in severe pulmonary disease and fatal encephalitis<disease> in humans and is responsible for outbreaks in Bangladesh , Malaysia , Singapore , India and possibly the Philippines. NiV has a negative-sense RNA genome that contains six genes and serves as a template for production of viral mRNA transcripts. NiV mRNA transcripts are subsequently translated into viral proteins. Traditionally , NiV quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) assays have relied on using primer sets that amplify a target ( N that encodes the nucleocapsid) within the coding region of the viral gene that also amplifies viral mRNA. Here we describe a novel one-step qRT-PCR assay targeting the intergenic region separating the viral F and G proteins , thereby eliminating amplification of the viral mRNA. This assay is more accurate than the traditional qRT-PCR in quantifying concentrations of viral genomic RNA.
