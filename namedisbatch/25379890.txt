  Currently , direct detection of Leptospira<pathogen> can be done in clinical laboratories by conventional and by real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR). We tested a biobank of paired samples of serum and urine from the same patient ( 202 patients) presenting at the hospital in an area endemic for leptospirosis<disease> using qRT-PCR followed by high resolution melting ( HRM) analysis. The results were compared with those obtained by conventional nested PCR and with the serologic gold standard microscopic agglutination test ( MAT). Differences were resolved by sequencing. qRT-PCR-HRM was positive for 46 of the 202 patients ( 22.7 % , accuracy 100 %) which is consistent with known prevalence of leptospirosis<disease> in the Azores. MAT results were positive for 3 of the 46 patients ( 6.5 %). Analysis of paired samples allowed us to identify the illness point at which patients presented at the hospital: onset , dissemination or excretion. The melting curve analysis of Leptospira<pathogen> species revealed that 60.9 % ( 28/46) of patients were infected with L.<pathogen> interrogans<pathogen> and 39.1 % ( 18/46) were infected with L borgpetersenii , both endemic to the Azores. We validated the use of qRT-PCR-HRM for diagnosis of leptospirosis<disease> and for identification of the Leptospira<pathogen> species at the earliest onset of infection in a clinical setting , in less than 2 hours.
