  Several Ebola<disease> vaccines and therapeutics are under clinical development. However , limited knowledge exists on the quality of antibody response generated by different Ebola<disease> vaccines. In this study , antibody repertoire induced by vaccination of transchromosomal bovine ( TcB) with Ebola<disease> virus ( EBOV<pathogen>) glycoprotein ( ( GP); recombinant GP ( rGP)) encoded by either deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA) or nanoparticle-based vaccine platform was analyzed using EBOV<pathogen> genome fragment phage display library and surface plasmon resonance ( SPR)- based real-time kinetics assay to measure antibody affinity maturation to both native and partially denatured Ebola<disease> GP as well as GP containing the receptor binding domain but lacking the mucin-like domain. Immunoglobulin ( IgG) obtained from rGP nanoparticle-vaccinated TcB demonstrated ~ 4-fold higher binding affinity compared with DNA-vaccinated TcB-induced IgG against the native rGP 's. The rGP nanoparticle vaccine generated a more robust and diverse antibody immune response to the native EBOV-GP compared with the DNA vaccine , which may explain the protective efficacy observed for these antibody preparations.
