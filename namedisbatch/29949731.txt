  Productivity of pigs in smallholder systems is affected by high disease burden , most of which might not be obvious , with their epidemiology and impact being poorly understood. This study estimated the seroprevalence and identified risk factors of a range of bacterial and viral pathogens of potential economic and public health importance in domestic pigs in Uganda. A total of 522 clinically healthy pigs were randomly selected from 276 pig farms in Masaka ( 142) and Lira ( 134) districts of Uganda in 2015. Overall the highest animal prevalence was found for Streptococcus<pathogen> suis<pathogen> 73.0 % ( CI95: 67.0-78.3) in Lira and 68.2 % ( CI95: 62.7-73.4) in Masaka; followed by Porcine circovirus type 2 with 50.8 % ( CI95: 44.5-57.2) in Lira and 40.7 % ( CI95: 35.2-46.5) in Masaka and Actinobacillus<pathogen> pleuro-pneumoniae , 25.6 % ( CI95: 20.4-31.6) in Lira and 20.5 % ( CI95: 16.2-25.6) in Masaka. Mycoplasma<pathogen> hyopneumonia prevalence was 20.9 % ( CI95: 16.2-26.6) in Lira and 10.1 % ( CI95: 7.1-14.1) in Masaka , while Porcine parvovirus was 6.2 % ( CI95: 4.0-9.7) in Masaka and 3.4 % ( CI95: 1.7-6.6) in Lira. Less common pathogens were Influenza<disease> A<pathogen> , 8.5 % ( CI95: 5.6-12.8) in Lira and 2.0 % ( CI95: 0.9-4.5) in Masaka and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory<disease> Syndrome<disease> Virus , 1.7 % ( CI95: 0.7-4.3) in Lira and 1.3 % ( CI95: 0.5-3.5) in Masaka. Even less common was Rotavirus<pathogen> A<pathogen> with 0.8 % ( CI95: 0.2-3.0) in Lira and 0.7 % ( CI95: 0.2-2.5) in Masaka; the same was for Aujeszky virus with 0.4 % ( CI95: 0.7-2.4) in Lira and 0.0 % ( CI95: 0.0-0.1) in Masaka. Co-infection with two pathogens was common and there was a significant association of M. hyo and PCV2 co-occurrence ( p = 0.016). Multivariate analysis showed that for S suis the use of disinfectant reduced odds of sero-positivitey ( OR = 0.15; p = 0.017) and pigs less than 6 months were more likely to be infected than older pigs ( OR = 3.35; p = 0.047). For M. hyo , crossbred pigs had higher odd of infection compared to local breeds ( OR = 1.59; p < 0.001). The studied pathogens have high prevalences in smallholder pig production and might be silent killers , thus affecting productivity and a possibility for some pathogens to spill over to humans. Given the limited knowledge of veterinary workers and the poor diagnostic capacities and capabilities , the diseases are potentially usually under-diagnosed. These findings constitute baseline data to measure impact of future interventions aiming to reduce disease burden in the pig production systems in Uganda.
