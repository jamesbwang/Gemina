  Because of the level of attention it received due to its role as the principal HIV<pathogen> coreceptor , CCR5 has been described as a ` celebrity ' chemokine receptor. Here we describe the development of CCR5 inhibitory strategies that have been developed for HIV<pathogen> therapy and which are now additionally being considered for use in HIV<pathogen> prevention and cure. The wealth of CCR5-related tools that have been developed during the intensive investigation of CCR5 as an HIV<pathogen> drug target can now be turned towards the study of CCR5 as a model chemokine receptor. We also summarize what is currently known about the cell biology and pharmacology of CCR5 , providing an update on new areas of investigation that have emerged in recent research. Finally , we discuss the potential of CCR5 as a drug target for diseases other than HIV<pathogen> , discussing the evidence linking CCR5 and its natural chemokine ligands with inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> , particularly neuroinflammation , and certain cancers. These pathologies may provide new uses for the strategies for CCR5 blockade originally developed to combat HIV/AIDS.
