  To determine MIC distributions for Mycobacterium<pathogen> chimaera<pathogen> , Mycobacterium<pathogen> intracellulare<pathogen> , Mycobacterium<pathogen> colombiense<pathogen> and Mycobacterium<pathogen> avium<pathogen> , and to derive tentative epidemiological cut-off ( ECOFF) values. A total of 683 bacterial isolates ( M.<pathogen> chimaera<pathogen> , n = 203; M.<pathogen> intracellulare<pathogen> , n = 77; M.<pathogen> colombiense<pathogen> , n = 68; M.<pathogen> avium<disease> , n = 335) from 627 patients were tested by broth microdilution according to CLSI protocol M24-A2 on Sensititre RAPMYCOI plates. MICs were interpreted based on CLSI breakpoints for clarithromycin , and tentative breakpoints for amikacin , moxifloxacin and linezolid. Tentative ECOFFs were determined by visual approximation and the ECOFFinder algorithm. Modal MIC , MIC Drug susceptibility patterns of M.<pathogen> chimaera<pathogen> are comparable to those of closely related species. Except for clarithromycin , breakpoints for Mycobacterium<disease> avium-intracellulare complex should be re-evaluated. Statistical determination of the 99.0 % ECOFF may be superior to visual approximation.
