  Noroviruses are recognized as the major global cause of sporadic and epidemic non-bacterial gastroenteritis<disease> in humans. Molecular mechanisms driving norovirus<pathogen> evolution are the accumulation of point mutations and recombination. Intragenotypic recombination has long been postulated to be a driving force of GII .4 noroviruses , the predominant genotype circulating in humans for over two decades. Increasingly , emergence and re-emergence of different intragenotype recombinants have been reported. The number and types of norovirus<pathogen> recombinants remained undefined until the 2007 Journal of General Virology research article ` Norovirus<pathogen> recombination ' reported an assembly of 20 hitherto unclassified intergenotypic norovirus<pathogen> recombinant types. In the intervening decade , a host of novel recombinants has been analysed. New recombination breakpoints have been described , in vitro and in vivo studies supplement in silico analyses , and advances have been made in analysing factors driving norovirus<pathogen> recombination. This work presents a timely overview of these data and focuses on important aspects of norovirus<pathogen> recombination and its role in norovirus<pathogen> molecular evolution. An overview of intergenogroup , intergenotype , intragenotype and ` obligatory ' norovirus<pathogen> recombinants as detected via in silico methods in the field is provided , enlarging the scope of intergenotypic recombinant types to 80 in total , and notably including three intergenogroup recombinants. A recap of advances made studying norovirus<pathogen> recombination in the laboratory is given. Putative drivers and constraints of norovirus<pathogen> recombination are discussed and the potential link between recombination and norovirus<pathogen> zoonosis risk is examined.
