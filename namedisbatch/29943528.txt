  Influenza<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( IBV<pathogen>) is a segmented negative-strand RNA virus , which often causes local outbreak or seasonal epidemic along with influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( IAV<pathogen>) in the world. It is pathogenic to children , teenagers and elderly people and has a higher mortality rate in children and adolescents , so it poses a serious threat to public health and health. IBV<pathogen> is more likely to cause complications than IAV<pathogen> and the disease burden of IBV<pathogen> even exceeds IAV<pathogen> in the epidemic season. Recently , especially after winter of 2017 , IBV<pathogen> has become the dominant strain in many areas of our country and seriously affects people 's health. In view of this , this article reviews the structure , epidemiology , immunology and prevention of IBV<pathogen> , aiming at enhancing public 's perceptions of the virus and providing reference for making strategies for prevention and control of influenza<disease> B.
