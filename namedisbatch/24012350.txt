  Japanese<disease> encephalitis<disease> ( JE) caused by Japanese<pathogen> encephalitis<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( JEV<pathogen>) poses a serious threat to the world 's public health yet without a cure. Certain JEV-infected neural cells express a subset of previously identified intrinsic antiviral interferon stimulated genes ( ISGs) , indicating brain cells retain autonomous antiviral immunity. However , whether this happens in composited brain remains unclear. Human pluripotent stem cell ( hPSC)- derived organoids can model disorders caused by human endemic pathogens such as Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> , which may potentially address this question and facilitate the discovery of a cure for JE. We thus generated telencephalon organoid and infected them with JEV<pathogen>. We found JEV<pathogen> infection caused significant decline of cell proliferation and increase of cell death in brain organoid , resulting in smaller organoid spheres. JEV<pathogen> tended to infect astrocytes and neural progenitors , especially the population representing outer radial glial cells ( oRGCs) of developing human brain. In addition , we revealed variable antiviral immunity in brain organoids of different stages of culture. In organoids of longer culture ( older than 8 weeks) , but not of early ones ( less than 4 weeks) , JEV<pathogen> infection caused typical activation of interferon signaling pathway. Preferential infection of oRGCs and differential antiviral response at various stages might explain the much more severe outcomes of JEV<pathogen> infection in the younger , which also provide clues to develop effective therapeutics of such diseases.
