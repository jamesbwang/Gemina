  Rapid antigen tests for influenza<disease> , herein referred to as rapid influenza<disease> diagnostic tests ( RIDTs) , have been widely used for the diagnosis of influenza<disease> since their introduction in the 1990 's due to their ease of use , rapid results , and suitability for point of care ( POC) testing. However , issues related to the diagnostic sensitivity of these assays have been known for decades , and these issues gained greater attention following reports of their poor performance during the 2009 influenza<disease> A<pathogen> ( H1N1<pathogen>) pandemic. In turn , significant concerns arose about the consequences of false negative results , which could pose significant risks to both individual patient care and to public health efforts. In response to these concerns , FDA convened an advisory panel in June 2013 to discuss options to improve the regulation of the performance of RIDTs. A proposed order was published on May 22 , 2014 and the final order published on January 12 , 2017 , reclassifying RIDTs from class I to class II medical devices , with additional requirements to comply with four new special controls. This reclassification is a landmark achievement in the regulation of diagnostic devices for infectious<disease> diseases<disease> , and has important consequences for the future of diagnostic influenza<disease> testing with commercial tests , warranting the prompt attention of clinical laboratories , healthcare systems , and healthcare providers.
