  Bacterial meningitis<disease> is a global public health concern , with several responsible etiologic agents that vary by age group and geographical area. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the etiology of bacterial meningitis<disease> in different age groups across global regions. PubMed and EMBASE were systematically searched for English language studies on bacterial meningitis<disease> , limited to articles published in the last five years. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using a customized scoring system. Meta-analyses were conducted to determine the frequency ( percentages) of seven bacterial types known to cause meningitis<disease>: Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , Haemophilus<pathogen> influenzae<pathogen> , Neisseria<pathogen> meningitidis<pathogen> , Streptococcus<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , group B Streptococcus<pathogen> agalactiae<pathogen> , Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , and Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> , with results being stratified by six geographical regions as determined by the World Health Organization , and seven age groups. Of the 3227 studies retrieved , 56 were eligible for the final analysis. In all age groups , S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> and N.<pathogen> meningitidis<pathogen> were the predominant pathogens in all regions , accounting for 25.1-41.2 % and 9.1-36.2 % of bacterial meningitis<disease> cases , respectively. S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> infection was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis<disease> in the ` all children ' group , ranging from 22.5 % ( Europe) to 41.1 % ( Africa) , and in all adults ranging from 9.6 % ( Western Pacific) to 75.2 % ( Africa). E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> were the most common pathogens that caused bacterial meningitis<disease> in neonates in Africa ( 17.7 % and 20.4 % , respectively). N.<pathogen> meningitidis<pathogen> was the most common in children aged Â± 1-5 years in Europe ( 47.0 %). Due to paucity of data , meta-analyses could not be performed in all age groups for all regions. A clear difference in the weighted frequency of bacterial meningitis<disease> cases caused by the different etiological agents was observed between age groups and between geographic regions. These findings may facilitate bacterial meningitis<disease> prevention and treatment strategies.
