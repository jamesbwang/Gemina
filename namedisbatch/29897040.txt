  Since 2015 , outbreaks of hepatitis<disease> A<disease> among men who have sex with men ( MSM) have been reported worldwide. To examine the impact of these MSM outbreaks in the Netherlands , we combined notification and epidemiological data with sequence analysis. Our results show the hazards of outbreaks within risk-groups spilling over into the largely susceptible general population. One third of the outbreak-related hepatitis<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> genotypes were detected in non-MSM cases.
