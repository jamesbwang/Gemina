  Development of potent vaccine for human<pathogen> respiratory<pathogen> syncytial<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HRSV<pathogen>) that confers better protection than natural infection remains a global challenge. Vaccination with naked DNA is considered successful approach for the control of many viral<disease> diseases<disease>. In this study , the potential of DNA vaccination using full-length attachment gene of HRSV<pathogen> type A Saudi strain cloned in pcDNA3 .1 + vector ( pcDNA/GA) was evaluated in BALB/c mice. The expression efficiency of pcDNA/GA was first confirmed in HEp-2 cells on RNA and protein levels. Mice immunization with either pcDNA/GA or the positive control formalin-inactivated vaccine ( FI-RSV) has generated significant serum antibody concentration in ELISA ( 7.31 ± 0.418 and 9.76 ± 0.006 µg/ml , respectively) with superior neutralizing activity. Similarly , both immunogens evoked robust HRSV-specific CD8 + T-cell response in ELISPOT assay compared to mice immunized with pcDNA3 .1 + vector or saline ( negative controls). Challenge of the immunized mice with the wild-type HRSV<pathogen> did not provoke clinical symptoms or mortality in any mice group. On the 7th day post-challenge , mice were euthanized and lungs were extirpated for evaluation of viral load , histopathological changes and cytokine profile. A significant diminish in the viral load and histology score were concluded in lungs of pcDNA/GA immunized mice compared to those immunized with FI-RSV and negative controls. The pulmonary cytokine profile of pcDNA/GA immunized mice displayed notable upregulation of Th1-associated cytokines while that of FI-RSV immunized mice exhibited high levels of Th2-associated cytokines. In conclusion , the DNA vaccine candidate pcDNA/GA has proven prominent efficacy and safety in mouse model , which encourages further evaluation in clinical trials.
