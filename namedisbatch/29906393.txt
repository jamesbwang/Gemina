  Salmonids are ecologically , economically , and culturally important fish species in North<pathogen> America , but whether contaminants in the environment play a role in their population decline is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that bisphenol A ( BPA) deposition in eggs , mimicking a maternal transfer scenario , compromises the stress axis functioning and target tissues stress response in two generations of a model salmonid species , rainbow<disease> trout ( Oncorhynchus<pathogen> mykiss). Eggs were enriched with 0 , 4 , or 40 ng of BPA , fertilized , and reared in clean water for two generations. The fish were subjected to an acute stressor after a year in both generations to test their stress performances. Trout raised from BPA-enriched eggs showed impaired stressor-mediated plasma cortisol and lactate response in the F1 and F2 generations , respectively. Key genes involved in cortisol biosynthesis in the head kidney , as well as stress- and growth-related transcripts in the liver and muscle , were impacted either in the F1 and/or F2 generations. Our results underscore the long-term impact associated with BPA in eggs , mimicking a maternal transfer scenario , on the stress performance of trout in two generations. The results highlight the need for developing novel biomarkers to predict long-term and generational toxicities in salmonids.
