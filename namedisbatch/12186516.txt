  Premature birth is a primary cause of infant mortality and its etiology varies in different countries. Chlamydia<pathogen> trachomatis<pathogen> ( CT) is a common infectious<disease> agent<disease> transmitted through sexual contact. The purpose of this study is to investigate the connection between CT infections and preterm birth by meta-analysis. All articles published in literature databases including Google Scholar , PubMed , ISI ( Web of Science) , Biological Abs , IranMedex , SID , and Scopus were investigated. Twenty-four relevant articles , authored betweenm 1998-2014 were analyzed through a random effects model. Heterogeneity of the studies was evaluated by I The overall prevalence of CT infections leading to preterm deliveries was estimated to be 0.13 % ( CI 95 %: 0.11-0.16). The prevalence of CT infections leading to preterm deliveries were calculated based on the study method including PCR ( 0.06 ( CI 95 %: 0.04-0.09)) , serology ( 0.23 ( CI 95 %: 0.10-0.35)) and culture ( 0.17 ( CI 95 %: 0.10-0.24)). Analysis indicates that women with chlamydia<pathogen> infections were 2.28 more likely to deliver pre-term in comparison with those who were not infected. It can be concluded that chlamydia<pathogen> infections increase the risks of preterm delivery , OR = 2.28 ( 95 % CI: 1.64-3.16). In regard to the results in numerous studies performed on different continents , this meta- analysis showed a clear association between preterm delivery and prior CT colonization.
