  A generic RT-PCR assay was developed for the universal detection of viruses<pathogen> of the genus Tobamovirus using a novel pair of degenerate primers designed based on conserved regions on replicase genes of 32 tobamoviruses. The assay detected nine tobamoviruses , including six Solanaceae-infecting subgroup tobamoviruses of Tobacco mosaic virus ( TMV) , Tomato mosaic virus ( ToMV) , Tomato mottle mosaic virus ( ToMMV) , Tobacco mottle green mosaic virus ( TMGMV) , Pepper mild mottle virus ( PMMoV) , Paprika mild mottle virus ( PaMMV) , one Orchidaceae-infecting tobamovirus of Odontoglossum ringspot virus ( ORSV) and two Cucurbitaceae-infecting subgroup tobamoviruses of Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus ( CGMMV) and Zucchini green mottle mosaic virus ( ZGMMV) , with high amplification efficiency , specificity and sensitivity. The assay was applied to detect tobamoviruses in pepper and tomato fields. Five tobamoviruses , PMMoV , TMV , ToMV , ToMMV and TMGMV , were detected from the pepper fields in single and mixed<disease> infections<disease>. Single infections of PMMoV , ToMV and ToMMV and mix-infection of ToMV + PMMoV were detected from the tomato fields. Among these viruses<pathogen> , PMMoV was first detected from tomato worldwide , while ToMMV was first detected from tomato plants in China. This generic assay is simple , cost-effective and has great potential to detect more tobamoviruses in the field.
