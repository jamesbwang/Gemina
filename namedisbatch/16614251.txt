  The presence of botulinum<pathogen> neurotoxin-producing Clostridia ( BPC) in food sources is a public health concern. In favorable environmental conditions , BPC can produce botulinum<pathogen> neurotoxins ( BoNTs) outside or inside the vertebrate host , leading to intoxications or toxico-infectious forms of botulism<disease> , respectively. BPC in food are almost invariably detected either by PCR protocols targeted at the known neurotoxin-encoding genes , or by the mouse test to assay for the presence of BoNTs in the supernatants of enrichment broths inoculated with the tested food sample. The sample is considered positive for BPC when the supernatant contains toxic substances that are lethal to mice , heat-labile and neutralized in vivo by appropriate polyclonal antibodies raised against purified BoNTs of different serotypes. Here , we report the detection in a food sample of a
