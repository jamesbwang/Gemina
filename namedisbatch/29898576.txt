  The eradication rate of the first-line triple therapy ( a proton pump inhibitor , clarithromycin , and amoxicillin) for Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection has gradually decreased in Korea. We evaluated whether clinical parameters , clarithromycin resistance , and CYP2C19 genotype can affect the eradication failure. A total of 203 patients with H. pylori-positive chronic gastritis<disease> were consecutively enrolled. They received clarithromycin-based triple therapy for 7 days. A clarithromycin resistance test was performed by detection of A2142G and A2143G point mutations in H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> 23S rRNA. The CYP2C19 genotype was examined for polymorphism G681A of exon 5 and G636A of exon 4 by polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism. Eradication was assessed by a 13C-urea breath test 4 weeks after treatment. Of 203 patients , 190 completed the study. The eradication rate was 64.0 % according to intention-to-treat analysis and 68.4 % by per-protocol analysis. CY-P2C19 genotypes were identified as follows: 75 poor metabolizers , 75 intermediate metabolizers , and 40 rapid metabolizers. Nonetheless , this polymorphism was not significantly associated with eradication failure ( p = 0.682). Clarithromycin resistance was detected in 33/190 patients ( 17.4 %) , and their eradication rate was zero. Clarithromycin resistance ( odds ratio ( OR) , 19.13; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 9.35 to 35.09) and female gender ( OR , 1.73; 95 % CI , 1.15 to 4.25) were significantly associated with eradication failure. The other clinical parameters such as age , cigarette smoking , alcohol intake , the body mass index , hypertension , and diabetes were not significantly associated with eradication. Clarithromycin resistance and female gender are factors affecting H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication failure in patients with chronic
