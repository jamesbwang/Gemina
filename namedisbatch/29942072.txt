  Amphibian populations worldwide are at risk of extinction from infectious<disease> diseases<disease> , including chytridiomycosis caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium<pathogen> dendrobatidis ( Bd). Amphibian cutaneous microbiomes interact with Bd and can confer protective benefits to the host. The composition of the microbiome itself is influenced by many environment- and host-related factors. However , little is known about the interacting effects of host population structure , genetic variation and developmental stage on microbiome composition and Bd prevalence across multiple sites. Here we explore these questions in Amietia hymenopus , a disease-affected frog in southern Africa. We use microsatellite genotyping and 16S amplicon sequencing to show that the microbiome associated with tadpole mouthparts is structured spatially , and is influenced by host genotype and developmental stage. We observed strong genetic structure in host populations based on rivers and geographic distances , but this did not correspond to spatial patterns in microbiome composition. These results indicate that demographic and host genetic factors affect microbiome composition within sites , but different factors are responsible for host population structure and microbiome structure at the between-site level. Our results help to elucidate complex within- and among- population drivers of microbiome structure in amphibian populations. That there is a genetic basis to microbiome composition in amphibians could help to inform amphibian conservation efforts against
