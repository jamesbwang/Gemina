  The H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza<disease> viruses ( HPAIVs) in China pose a serious challenge to public health and the poultry industry. In this study , we constructed a replication-competent recombinant influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> of clade 2.3.4.4 –ù5N1 expressing the clade 2.3.2.1 H5 HA1 protein from a tricistronic NS segment. We used a truncated NS1 protein of 73 amino acids combined with a heterologous dimerization domain to increase protein stability. H5 HA1 and nuclear export information were fused in frame with a truncated NS1 open reading frame , separated by 2A self-processing sites. The resulting PR8-H5-NS1 ( 73) H5 stably expressed clade 2.3.4.4 H5 HA and clade 2.3.2.1 H5 HA1 proteins and exhibited similar in vitro growth kinetics as the parental PR8-2344H5 virus. PR8-H5-NS1 ( 73) H5 induced specific hemagglutination-inhibition ( HI) antibody against clade 2.3.4.4 H5 that was comparable to that of the combination vaccine of PR8-2344H5 and PR8-2321H5. HI antibody titers were significantly lower against clade 2.3.2.1 H5 virus than with the combination vaccine. PR8-H5-NS1 ( 73) H5 completely protected chickens from both clade 2.3.4.4 and clade 2.3.2.1 H5 HPAIVs challenge. Our results suggested that PR8-H5-NS1 ( 73) H5 was highly immunogenic and efficacious against both clade 2.3.4.4 and clade 2.3.2.1 H5 HPAIVs in chickens.
