  This study aims to determine the microbiological profile and risk factors associated with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in canine severe corneal ulcers<disease>. Thirty-two corneal and conjunctival swabs were collected from dogs with diagnosed severe corneal ulcers<disease> that presented to Prasu-Arthorn veterinary teaching hospital in Nakhon Pathom , Thailand from June 2015 to June 2016. Microorganisms were identified by means of genotypic and phenotypic approaches. Of 32 ulcers<disease> sampled , 26 ( 81.3 %) yielded culturable microorganisms with 24 bacterial isolates and 7 fungal isolates. The most commonly isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus<pathogen> spp. ( 45.8 % , 11/24) and Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa ( 20.8 % , 5/24). Out of 11 staphylococcal isolates identified , 10 carried the mecA gene providing methicillin resistance. The extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase ( ESBL) encoding genes bla
