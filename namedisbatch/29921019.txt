  Carriage of Salmonella is often associated with a high level of bacterial excretion and generally occurs after a short systemic<disease> infection<disease>. However , we do not know whether this systemic<disease> infection<disease> is required or whether the carrier-state corresponds to continuous reinfection or real persistence in caecal tissue. The use of a Salmonella<disease> Enteritidis<pathogen> bamB mutant demonstrated that a carrier-state could be obtained in chicken in the absence of systemic<disease> infection<disease>. The development of a new infection model in isolator showed that a marked decrease in animal reinfection and host-to-host transmission between chicks led to a heterogeneity of S.<pathogen> Enteritidis<pathogen> excretion and colonization contrary to what was observed in cages. This heterogeneity of infection was characterized by the presence of super-shedders , which constantly disseminated Salmonella to the low-shedder chicks , mainly through airborne movements of contaminated dust particles. The presence of super-shedders , in the absence of host-to-host transmission , demonstrated that constant reinfection was not required to induce a carrier-state. Finally , our results suggest that low-shedder chicks do not have a higher capability to destroy Salmonella but instead can block initial Salmonella<pathogen> colonization. This new paradigm opens new avenues to improve understanding of the carrier-state mechanisms and to define new strategies to control Salmonella<pathogen> infections.
