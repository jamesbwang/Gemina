  The purpose of this study is to analyze the morphological , histological , immunohistochemical and ultrasound findings in the placenta of maternal type 1 and gestational diabetes , to compare the pathological changes of the placental structure in the two types<pathogen> of metabolic disruptions , but also to establish correlations with the expression of these findings , influenced by different associated conditions. This multicenter study includes 53 pregnancies , of which 37 with pregestational and 16 with gestational diabetes. All cases undergone specific obstetric ultrasound assessment and detailed placental scan. There were assessed 49 singleton and four twin pregnancies , all of which having live births as fetal outcome. Maternal preexisting hypertension , preeclampsia and obesity were the main associated conditions. Placental ultrasound scan revealed increased placental thickness even from the second trimester , with significant increases in the first half , and placentomegaly at the end of the third trimester. Macroscopic analysis of the placentas and umbilical cords<disease> has shown that the placentas of women with diabetes are heavier , and abnormal cord insertion has been also found. Gross analysis of maternal and fetal surfaces of the placentas revealed certain changes in both metabolic conditions. We observed 14 types<pathogen> of placental pathological findings in pregestational and 11 in gestational diabetes. In diabetic placenta , it is not appropriate to discuss about specific changes , but rather about a pathological diabetic pattern , influenced by associated conditions. Preconceptional and first trimester glycemic control is the key element , and euglycemia throughout pregnancy is a purpose whose accomplishment depends the maternal-fetal outcome.
