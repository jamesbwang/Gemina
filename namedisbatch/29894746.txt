  Ebolaviruses are highly virulent pathogens that cause Ebola<disease> viral<disease> disease<disease> ( EVD). Data from non-human primate ( NHP) models and from human survivors of EVD suggest that anti-Ebola antibodies play an integral role in protection. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC) is a potential mechanism through which anti-Ebola antibodies may mediate protection. We developed a robust Ebola-specific ADCC assay for use in ongoing trials of Ebola<disease> vaccines. Stable cell lines for inducible Zaire<pathogen> ebolavirus<pathogen> glycoprotein ( EBOV<pathogen> GP) expression were developed to provide a uniform source of target cells in the assay , and were combined with an existing human natural killer ( NK) cell line as the effector cell. When applied to commercially available anti-EBOV GP monoclonal antibodies , the assay clearly differentiated antibody with high ADCC activity from those with low or no ADCC activity. Anti-EBOV ADCC activity was also detected in plasma samples from rhesus macaques immunized with a candidate Ebola<disease> vaccine. The Ebola<disease> ADCC assay reported here will be a useful tool in studying the functionality of anti-EBOV GP antibodies elicited by Ebola<disease> vaccines in ongoing and future clinical trials.
