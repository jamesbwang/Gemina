  Broadly cross-reactive antibodies that recognize conserved epitopes within the influenza<disease> virus<pathogen> hemagglutinin ( HA) stalk domain are of particular interest for their potential use as therapeutic and prophylactic agents against multiple influenza<disease> virus<pathogen> subtypes including zoonotic virus strains. Here , we characterized four human HA stalk-reactive monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs) for their binding breadth and affinity ,
