  Human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) infection is a major risk factor for the development of active tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) , one of the deadliest infectious<disease> diseases<disease> globally. The high mortality associated with the disease can be reduced by early diagnosis and prompt antituberculous treatment initiation. Facilities in TB-endemic regions are increasing the use of nucleic acid amplification ( e.g. , GeneXpert) , which provides rapid results but may have suboptimal sensitivity in HIV-associated TB. Our objective was to evaluate the current practices for TB diagnosis at Edendale Hospital , a large regional hospital in KwaZulu-Natal , South Africa-a TB-endemic region with high HIV<pathogen> prevalence. In this cross-sectional study , all adult inpatients newly started on TB treatment at Edendale were identified over a 6-week period. Demographics , clinical information , diagnostic test results , and outcomes were documented. Pulmonary TB ( PTB) , extrapulmonary TB ( EXTB) , and PTB + EXTB were defined as disease evidence in the lungs , other organs , or both , respectively. Ninety-four cases were identified , of which 83 % were HIV-associated. Only 30 % of all TB patients were microbiologically confirmed , consisting of 7/16 ( 44 %) HIV-uninfected and 21/78 ( 27 %) HIV-infected TB patients. Smear microscopy and mycobacterial culture were seldom ordered. Ultrasound was performed in about one-third of suspected EXTB cases and was valuable in identifying abdominal TB. In this clinical setting with a high incidence of HIV-associated TB , TB diagnosis was more commonly based on clinical assessment and imaging results than on mycobacterial gold standard test confirmation.
