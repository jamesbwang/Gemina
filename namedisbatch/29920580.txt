  Lyme<disease> disease<disease> is the most common reportable zoonotic infection in the United States. Recent data suggests spread of the Ixodes<pathogen> tick vector and increasing incidence of Lyme<disease> disease<disease> in several states , including Pennsylvania. We sought to determine the clinical presentation and healthcare utilization patterns for pediatric Lyme<disease> disease<disease> in western Pennsylvania. The electronic medical records of all patients with an ICD9 diagnosis of Lyme<disease> disease<disease> between 2003-2013 at Children 's Hospital of Pittsburgh were individually reviewed for cases meeting the 2011 CDC case definition for Lyme<disease> disease<disease> 773 patients meeting these criteria were retrospectively analyzed for patient demographics , disease manifestations , and healthcare utilization. An exponential increase in Lyme<disease> disease<disease> occurred in the pediatric population of western Pennsylvania. There was a southwestward migration of Lyme<disease> cases , with a shift in concentration from rural to non-rural zip codes. Healthcare provider involvement also changed from subspecialists to primary care pediatricians ( PCP) and emergency departments ( ED). Patients from non-rural zip codes more commonly presented to the ED , while patients from rural zip codes utilized PCPs and EDs similarly. The current study details the conversion of western Pennsylvania from a Lyme-na√Øve to a Lyme-epidemic area , highlighting changes in clinical presentation and healthcare utilization as the epidemic evolved. Presenting symptoms and provider-type differed between those from rural and non-rural zip codes. By understanding the temporospatial epidemiology , disease presentation and healthcare utilization of Lyme<disease> , the current study may inform future public health initiatives regionally while serving as an archetype for other areas at-risk for Lyme<disease> epidemics.
