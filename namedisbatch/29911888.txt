  The extent of the genetic relatedness among Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> isolates and its impact on clinical outcomes in the cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF) population is poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of clonal P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> infection in Canada and to associate P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> genotypes with clinical outcomes. This was an observational study of adult and pediatric patients with CF across Canada. Isolates were typed using multilocus sequence typing. A clone was defined as sharing at least six of seven alleles. Genotyping results were associated with clinical outcomes , including forced expiratory volume in 1 second , body mass index , rate of pulmonary exacerbation , and death/transplant. A total of 1,537 P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> isolates were genotyped to 403 unique sequence types ( STs) in 402 individuals with CF. Although 39 % of STs were shared , most were shared only among a small number of subjects , and the majority ( 79 %) of the genetic diversity in P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> isolates was observed between patients. There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes according to genotype. However , patients with a dynamic , changing ST infection pattern had both a steeper decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( -2.9 % predicted change/yr , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = -3.8 to -1.9 compared with 0.4 , 95 % CI = -0.3 to 1.0; P < 0.001) and body mass index ( -1.0 percentile change/yr , 95 % CI = -1.6 to -0.3 compared with -0.1 , 95 % CI = -0.7 to 0.5; P = 0.047) than those with a stable infection with the same ST. There was no widespread sharing of dominant clones in our CF population , and the majority of the genetic diversity in P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> was observed between patients. Changing genotypes over time within an individual was associated with worse clinical outcomes.
