  Data from the Middle<pathogen> East regarding second primary malignancy ( SPM) after radical prostatectomy are limited. Our objective was to estimate the overall risk of developing second primary malignancy ( SPM) among Middle Eastern<disease> men with prostate cancer who underwent surgical extirpation of their prostate. We conducted a retrospective study of 406 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy in a tertiary centre and who had no evidence of previous malignancy from 1998 to 2012. Standardized incidence ratios ( SIRs) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI) were calculated to analyze the risk of SPM in our population compared with the general population. Cox-regression models were also conducted to correlate the clinicopathological factors with the development of SPM. After 14 years of follow-up , the incidence rate of SPM was 100.9 per 1,000 person-years. The most frequent SPMs were bladder cancer ( Patients with prostate cancer who underwent surgical expiration of their prostate are at lower risk of developing SPM compared with the general population.
