  Proteus<pathogen> anguinus is a neotenic cave amphibian endemic to the Dinaric Karst and represents a symbol of Slovenian natural heritage. It is classified as ` Vulnerable ' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN) and is one of the EU priority species in need of strict protection. Due to inaccessibility of its natural underground habitat , scientific studies have been primarily conducted on Proteus<pathogen> in captivity where amphibians may be particularly susceptible to opportunistic microbial infections. In this case report , we present the results of an analysis of an individual that had been kept in captivity for 6 yr and then developed clinical symptoms , including ulcers<disease> , suggesting opportunistic microbial infection. Pigmented fungal hyphae and yeast-like cells were present in the dermis and in almost all other sampled tissues. Sampling of the ulcer<disease> allowed the isolation of a diverse array of bacterial and fungal species. We identified the water-borne , polymorphic black yeast Exophiala<pathogen> salmonis<pathogen> , an opportunistic pathogen of fish , as the cause of the primary infection. This is the first report on a fungal infection of Proteus<pathogen> and on cave salamanders in general.
