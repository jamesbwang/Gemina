  The use of antimicrobials in aquaculture is increasingly being scrutinized. In Chile , piscirickettsiosis accounts for approximately 90 % of the total volume of antibiotics used in marine aquaculture. Treatment failures are frequently reported , but there is limited information on why this occurs. Fish producers have started assessing the level of antibiotics in fish tissues during and immediately after in-feed treatments to determine if they are adequately medicating their fish. In this study , we evaluated the probability of finding antibiotic concentrations in muscle tissue above the minimum inhibitory concentration for 90 % of the P. salmonis<pathogen> isolates ( MIC90) recently tested in Chile , for two antibiotics commonly used in aquaculture. We found that the proportion of fish with antibiotic concentrations above the MIC90 varied , depending on the product used , species , day of sample collection , and size category of fish within a cage. The proportion of fish above the MIC90 was lower in fish treated with florfenicol than in fish treated with oxytetracycline. Using a mixed-effects logistic model , we modeled the probability of antibiotic concentrations above MIC90 when fish were treated with florfenicol. Our model suggested lower probabilities of having concentrations above MIC90 in Atlantic<disease> salmon than in rainbow<disease> trout when samples were collected 14 days after the treatment started compared to 7 days , and in the smaller fish within a cage. We discuss these findings and hypothesize about potential issues with treating large populations of fish with in-feed antimicrobials.
