  Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) infection of pregnant women can cause fetal microcephaly and other neurologic defects. We describe the development of a non-human primate model to better understand fetal pathogenesis. To reliably induce fetal infection at defined times , four pregnant rhesus macaques are inoculated intravenously and intraamniotically with ZIKV at gestational day ( GD) 41 , 50 , 64 , or 90 , corresponding to first and second trimester of gestation. The GD41-inoculated animal , experiencing fetal death 7 days later , has high virus levels in fetal and placental tissues , implicating ZIKV as cause of death. The other three fetuses are carried to near term and euthanized; while none display gross microcephaly , all show ZIKV RNA in many tissues , especially in the brain , which exhibits calcifications and reduced neural precursor cells. Given that this model consistently recapitulates neurologic defects of human congenital Zika<disease> syndrome<disease> , it is highly relevant to unravel determinants of fetal neuropathogenesis and to explore interventions.
