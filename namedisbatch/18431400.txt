  Human influenza<disease> virus<pathogen> ( IAV<pathogen>) are among the most common pathogens to cause human<pathogen> respiratory<disease> infections<disease>. A better understanding on interplay between IAV<pathogen> and host factors may provide clues for disease prevention and control. While many viruses are known to downregulate p53 upon entering the cell to reduce the innate host antiviral response , IAV<pathogen> infection is unusual in that it activates p53. However , it has not been clear whether this process has proviral or antiviral effects. In this study , using human isogenic p53 wild-type and p53null A549 cells generated from the CRISPR/Cas9 technology , we observed that p53null cells exhibit significantly reduced viral propagation when infected with influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1<pathogen>). Genome-wide microarray analysis revealed that p53 regulates the expression of a large set of interferon-inducible genes , among which the interferon-induced transmembrane family members IFITM1 , IFITM2 , and IFITM3 were most significantly downregulated by the expression of p53. Knockdown of interferon-induced transmembrane proteins ( IFITMs) by short interfering RNAs enhanced influenza<disease> virus<pathogen> infectivity in p53null A549 cells , while overexpressed IFITMs in A549 cells blocked virus entry. Intriguingly , regulation of IFITMs by p53 is independent of its transcriptional activity , as the p53 short isoform Î”40p53 recapitulates IFITM regulation. Taken together , these data reveal that p53 activation by IAV<pathogen> is an essential step in maintaining its infectivity. This novel association between human p53 and the broad spectrum antiviral proteins , the IFITMs , demonstrates a previous mechanism employed by influenza<disease> virus<pathogen> to enhance its propagation
