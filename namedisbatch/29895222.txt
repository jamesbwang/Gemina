  Viruses<pathogen> masterfully regulate host gene expression during infection. Many do so , in part , by expressing non-coding RNAs. Recent work has shown that HSUR 2 , a viral non-coding RNA expressed by the oncogenic Herpesvirus<pathogen> saimiri , regulates mRNA expression through a novel mechanism. HSUR 2 base pairs with both target mRNAs and host miRNAs in infected cells. This results in HSUR 2-dependent recruitment of host miRNAs and associated Ago proteins to target mRNAs , and the subsequent destabilization of target mRNAs. Using this mechanism , this virus regulates key cellular pathways during viral<disease> infection<disease>. Here I discuss the evolution of our thinking about HSUR function and explore the implications of recent findings in relation to the current views on the functions of interactions between miRNAs and other classes of non-coding RNAs , the potential advantages of this mechanism of regulation of gene expression , and the evolutionary origin of HSUR 2.
