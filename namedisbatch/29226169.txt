  Japanese<disease> encephalitis<disease> ( JE) is a vector-borne disease caused by the Japanese<pathogen> encephalitis<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( JEV<pathogen>). JEV<pathogen> is transmitted by mosquitoes to a wide range of vertebrate hosts , including birds and mammals. Domestic animals , especially pigs , are generally implicated as reservoirs of the virus , while humans are not part of the natural transmission cycle and can not pass the virus to other hosts. Although JEV<pathogen> infection is very common in endemic areas ( many countries in Asia) , less than 1 % of people affected develop clinical disease , and severe disease affects about 1 case per 250 JEV<pathogen> infections. Although rare , severe disease can be devastating; among the 30,000-50,000 global cases per year , approximately 20-30 % of patients die and 30-50 % of survivors develop significant neurological sequelae. JE is a significant public health problem for residents in endemic areas and may constitute a substantial risk for travelers to these areas. The epidemiology of JE and its risk to travelers have changed , and continue to evolve. The rapid economic growth of Asian countries has led to a surge in both inbound and outbound travel , making Asia the second most-visited region in the world after Europe , with 279 million international travelers in 2015. The top destination is China , followed by Thailand , Hong Kong , Malaysia and Japan , and the number of travelers is forecast to reach 535 million by 2030 ( + 4.9 % per year). Because of the lack of treatment and the infeasibility of eliminating the vector , vaccination is recognized as the most efficacious means of preventing JE. The IC51 vaccine ( IXIARO
