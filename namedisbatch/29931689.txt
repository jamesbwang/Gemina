  Floating passive-integrated transponder ( PIT) antennae and smolt traps were used to study the time of sea entry and relative recapture of wild and hatchery-reared Atlantic<disease> salmon Salmo<pathogen> salar<pathogen> smolt released below and above a lake formed in the Vosso River. In total , 8.4 and 4.1 % of the tagged wild and hatchery fish , respectively , were detected leaving the river ( i.e. sea entry). Wild smolts released below the lake were detected leaving the river 16 days before smolts released above the lake , which also showed a 52 % lower probability of detection during out-migration. Hatchery smolts were out of sync with the wild smolts and were detected approximately 2 months later than the wild smolts from both release locations , with an 84 % lower likelihood of detection than wild fish. Size selection was evident for wild fish released above the lake , but not below the lake , with an overall likelihood of detection increasing by 2.6 % per cm total length ( L
