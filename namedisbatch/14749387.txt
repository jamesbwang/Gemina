  Cortistatin A is a natural product isolated from the marine sponge Corticium simplex<disease> and was found to be a potent and selective inhibitor of CDK8. Many synthetic groups have reported total syntheses of Cortistatin A; however , these syntheses require between 16 and 30 steps and report between 0.012-2 % overall yields , which is not amenable to large-scale production. Owing to similarities between the complex<pathogen> core of Cortistatin A and the simple steroid core , we initiated a campaign to design simple , more easily prepared CDK8 inhibitors based on a steroid scaffold that would be more convenient for large-scale synthesis. Herein , we report the discovery and optimization of JH-VIII-49 , a potent and selective inhibitor of CDK8 with a simple steroid core that has an eight-step synthesis with a 33 % overall yield , making it suitable for large-scale preparation. Using this scaffold , we then developed a bivalent small molecule degrader , JH-XI-10-02 , that can recruit the E3 ligase CRL4
