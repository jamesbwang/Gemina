  Influenza<disease> viruses exist in each host as a collection of genetically diverse variants , which might enhance their adaptive potential. To assess the genetic and functional diversity of highly pathogenic avian influenza<disease> A<pathogen> ( H5N1<pathogen>) viruses<pathogen> within infected humans , we used deep-sequencing methods to characterize samples obtained from infected patients in northern Vietnam during 2004-2010 on different days after infection , from different anatomic sites , or both. We detected changes in virus genes that affected receptor binding , polymerase activity , or interferon antagonism , suggesting that these factors could play roles in influenza<disease> virus<pathogen> adaptation to humans. However , the frequency of most of these mutations remained low in the samples tested , implying that they were not efficiently selected within these hosts. Our data suggest that adaptation of influenza<disease> A<pathogen> ( H5N1<pathogen>) viruses<pathogen> is probably stepwise and depends on accumulating combinations of mutations that alter function while maintaining fitness.
