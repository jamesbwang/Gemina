  This analysis evaluated the clinical activity of ceftazidime/avibactam against MDR Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> isolates pooled from the adult Phase III clinical trials in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection ( cIAI) , complicated urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> ( cUTI) or nosocomial pneumonia<disease> ( NP) including ventilator-associated<disease> pneumonia<disease> ( VAP). Baseline isolates from five Phase III randomized controlled trials of ceftazidime/avibactam versus predominantly carbapenem comparators in patients with cIAI ( RECLAIM 1 and 2; NCT01499290 and RECLAIM 3; NCT01726023) , cUTI ( RECAPTURE 1 and 2; NCT01595438 and NCT01599806) , NP including VAP ( REPROVE; NCT01808092) and cIAI or cUTI caused by ceftazidime-non-susceptible Gram-negative pathogens ( REPRISE; NCT01644643) were tested for MDR status and susceptibility to ceftazidime/avibactam and carbapenem-based comparators using CLSI broth microdilution methodology. Microbiological and clinical responses for patients with ≥ 1 MDR Enterobacteriaceae or P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> isolate were assessed at the test-of-cure ( TOC) visit. In the pooled microbiologically modified ITT population , 1051 patients with MDR Enterobacteriaceae and 95 patients with MDR P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> isolates were identified. Favourable microbiological response rates at TOC for all MDR Enterobacteriaceae and MDR P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> were 78.4 % and 57.1 % , respectively , for ceftazidime/avibactam and 71.6 % and 53.8 % , respectively , for comparators. The proportions of patients with ≥ 1 MDR isolate who were clinically cured at TOC were similar in the ceftazidime/avibactam ( 85.4 %) and comparator ( 87.9 %) arms. Ceftazidime/avibactam demonstrated similar clinical efficacy to predominantly carbapenem comparators against MDR Enterobacteriaceae and P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> , and may be a suitable alternative to carbapenem-based therapies for cIAI , cUTI and NP/VAP caused by MDR Gram-negative pathogens.
