  The burden of active tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) in pregnancy compared with preconception and postpartum is unclear , particularly with universal antiretroviral therapy ( ART) initiation in pregnancy. We retrospectively compared active TB incidence in the 18 months preconception , during pregnancy and up to 6 months postpartum in human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) positive women attending antenatal care at a primary health care facility in Cape Town from 2013 to 2014. Among 1513 women ( 4116 person-years ( py)) , 1489 ( 98.4 %) received lifelong ART in pregnancy , and 79 TB episodes were identified. Unadjusted TB incidence rates ( IR) preconception , during pregnancy and postpartum were 2466 ( 95 % CI 1863-3202) , 1127 ( 95 % CI 600-1928) and 1447 ( 95 % CI 694-2661) per 100000 py , respectively. Adjusting for age and CD4 count at first antenatal visit and ART status , TB risk was lower during pregnancy ( incidence rate ratio ( IRR) 0.17 vs. preconception , 95 % CI 0.09-0.31) and increased slightly postpartum ( IRR 1.31 vs. pregnancy , 95 % CI 0.56-3.07). Among HIV-positive women in South Africa , the TB burden preconception , during pregnancy and postpartum was substantial. The risk of TB during pregnancy was lower than preconception , but increased slightly postpartum; this represents missed opportunities for diagnosis , prevention and control. Improved TB prevention strategies and integrated care for HIV-positive women and their children are needed.
