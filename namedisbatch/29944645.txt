  Men who have sex with men ( MSM) are at high risk for sexually transmitted infections ( STIs). National guidelines recommend that MSM receive HIV<pathogen> , syphilis<disease> , gonorrhea<disease> , and chlamydia<pathogen> screening at least annually , and hepatitis<disease> A<disease> and B and human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> vaccinations. We investigated associations between disclosure of male-male sexual orientation/behavior and receipt of this panel of services. Gay , bisexual and other MSM aged 18-26 years were enrolled from health clinics serving lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender communities in Los Angeles and Chicago during 2012-2014. Participants completed a computer-assisted self-interview regarding healthcare services , disclosure of sexual orientation/behavior , and recent HIV<pathogen> test results. Proportions receiving recommended care , prevalence ratios ( PRs) , and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were calculated using SAS 9.4. Overall , 817 participants visited a provider within the past year. Of these , 525 ( 64.3 %) had disclosed , and 749 ( 91.7 %) felt they could disclose if important to health. In total , 548 ( 67.1 %) received all STI screenings , 74 ( 9.1 %) received all vaccinations. Only 105 ( 12.9 %) received any HPV<pathogen> vaccination. More disclosing participants received all recommended screenings ( aPR: 1.4 , CI: 1.3-1.6) and all recommended care components ( aPR: 2.2 , CI: 1.4-4.3) than non-disclosing participants. Despite national recommendations , receipt of a complete panel of STI care services was low among young MSM. Vaccine uptake was lower than STI screening. However , most participants visited a healthcare provider in the past year and most disclosed , suggesting opportunities to improve services. Providers might encourage disclosure by improving sexual history-taking and education , which could increase opportunities for MSM to receive recommended care.
