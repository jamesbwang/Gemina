  Yellow<disease> fever<disease> ( YF) was one of the most dangerous infectious<disease> diseases<disease> of the 18th and 19th centuries , resulting in mass casualties in Africa and the Americas. The etiologic agent is yellow<pathogen> fever<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( YFV) , and its live-attenuated form , YFV-17D , remains one of the most potent vaccines ever developed. During the first half of the 20th century , vaccination combined with mosquito control eradicated YFV transmission in urban areas. However , the recent 2016-2018 outbreaks in areas with historically low or no YFV activity have raised serious concerns for an estimated 400-500 million unvaccinated people who now live in at-risk areas. Once a forgotten disease , we highlight here that YF still represents a very real threat to human health and economies. As many gaps remain in our understanding of how YFV interacts with the human host and causes disease , there is an urgent need to address these knowledge gaps and propel YFV research forward.
