  We here disclose chemical synthesis of ribonucleoside 5 '- monophosphate ( RMP) ,- diphosphate ( RDP) , and- triphosphate ( RTP) and cycloSal- , Di PPro- , and Tri PPPro nucleotide prodrugs of the antiviral pseudobase T-1105. Moreover , we include one nucleoside diphosphate prodrug of the chemically less stable T-705. We demonstrate efficient T-1105-RDP and- RTP release from the Di PPro and Tri PPPro compounds by esterase activation. Using crude enzyme extracts , we saw rapid phosphorylation of T-1105-RDP into T-1105-RTP. In sharp contrast , phosphorylation of T-1105-RMP was not seen , indicating a yet unrecognized bottleneck in T-1105 's metabolic activation. Accordingly , Di PPro and Tri PPPro compounds displayed improved cell culture activity against influenza<disease> A<pathogen> and B virus<pathogen> , which they retained in a mutant cell line incapable of activating the nucleobase parent. T-1105-RTP had a strong inhibitory effect against isolated influenza<disease> polymerase , and Di PPro-T-1105-RDP showed 4-fold higher potency in suppressing one-cycle viral RNA synthesis versus T-1105. Hence , our T-1105-RDP and- RTP prodrugs improve antiviral potency and achieve efficient metabolic bypass.
