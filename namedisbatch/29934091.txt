  The emerging arthropod-borne flavivirus<pathogen> Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) is associated with neurological complications. Innate immunity is essential for the control of virus infection , but the innate immune mechanisms that impact viral<disease> infection<disease> of neurons remain poorly defined. Using the genetically tractable Drosophila system , we show that ZIKV infection of the adult fly brain leads to NF-kB-dependent inflammatory signaling , which serves to limit infection. ZIKV-dependent NF-kB activation induces the expression of Drosophila stimulator of interferon genes ( dSTING) in the brain. dSTING protects against ZIKV by inducing autophagy in the brain. Loss of autophagy leads to increased ZIKV infection of the brain and death of the infected fly , while pharmacological activation of autophagy is protective. These data suggest an essential role for an inflammation-dependent STING pathway in the control of neuronal infection and a conserved role for STING in antimicrobial autophagy , which may represent an ancestral function for this essential innate immune sensor.
