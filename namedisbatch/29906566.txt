  Capsular type K1 Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , highly virulent strains which are common in Asian countries , can cause pyogenic<disease> infections<disease>. These hypervirulent strains are usually susceptible to most antimicrobials , except for ampicillin. Little is known regarding the clinical and molecular characteristics of antimicrobial-resistant K1 K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> strains. This retrospective study evaluated patients infected with capsular type K1 K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> strains in a Taiwanese medical centre between April 2013 and March 2016. Antimicrobial-resistant strains were defined based on non-susceptibility to antimicrobial agents except ampicillin. We compared the clinical outcome of patients infected with and without antimicrobial-resistant strains. The in vivo virulence , genetic relatedness , and resistance mechanisms of these hypervirulent antimicrobial-resistant strains were also investigated. A total of 182 capsular type K1 K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> strains were identified , including 18 antimicrobial-resistant strains. The 28-day mortality rate among the 18 cases caused by antimicrobial-resistant strains was significantly higher than that among 164 cases caused by antimicrobial-sensitive strains ( 50 % vs. 10.4 % , P < 0.001). Infection with antimicrobial-resistant strain independently increased the 28-day mortality risk. Most antimicrobial-resistant strains were not clonally related , and they exhibited high in vivo virulence in a mouse lethality experiment. The major resistance mechanisms involved the presence of Î²-lactamases and the overexpression of efflux pumps. In conclusion , hypervirulent antimicrobial-resistant capsular type K1 K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> strains can predispose to a fatal outcome. These strains may represent an emerging threat to public health in Taiwan.
