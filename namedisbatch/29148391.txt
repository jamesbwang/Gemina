  A novel bovine astrovirus<pathogen> genotype species ( BoAstV-CH13/ NeuroS1) was recently identified in brain tissues of cattle as a plausible cause of encephalitis<disease>. The purpose of the present study was to develop and validate real time RT-PCR assays for the detection of BoAstV-CH13/ NeuroS1 in brain tissues of cattle. Three different primer-probe combinations were designed based on BoAstV-CH13/ NeuroS1 full-genome sequences of 11 different strains identified in cattle , and established in three distinct one-step real time RT-PCR protocols. These protocols were compared regarding their diagnostic performance using brain tissues of cattle with and without astrovirus<pathogen> associated encephalitis<disease>. The limit of detection ( LOD) of all three assays was between 1.34 Ã— 10
