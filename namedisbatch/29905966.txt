  The objectives of the work are to elucidate the incidence and virological findings of chromosomally integrated human<pathogen> herpesvirus<pathogen> 6 ( ciHHV-6) in Japanese population and to analyze an association between ciHHV-6 and the clinical manifestation of exanthema<disease> subitum<disease> ( ES). Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine HHV-6 DNA loads in 2347 cord blood samples from healthy neonates ( cohort A) , febrile children less than 5 years old ( cohort B) , and hematopoietic cell transplant recipients ( cohort C). CiHHV-6 was confirmed by detection of high copy numbers of viral DNA in somatic cells. The integration site was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. In the ciHHV-6 subjects of cohorts A and B , HHV-6 antibody titers were measured , the history of ES was obtained , and the incidence of ES was compared with non-ciHHV-6 children without primary HHV-6B infection in the cohort B. CiHHV-6 was detected in 14 ( 0.60 %) of the 2347 samples: A ( 6/1006 , 0.60 %) , B ( 6/790 , 0.76 %) , and C ( 2/551 , 0.36 %). The integration sites were on chromosome 22q in seven cases , Yp in two cases , and 17q and Xp in one case. No past history of ES was observed in 11 of the 12 subjects. Nine children with ciHHV-6 underwent serological analysis and were found to be positive for HHV-6 IgG antibodies. Incidence of ES was statistically higher in the control subjects than the ciHHV-6 subjects ( P = 0.0039). In Japan , the frequency of ciHHV-6 was 0.60 %. A high incidence of ciHHV-6A , specifically in chromosome 22 , is a characteristic finding among the Japanese. CiHHV-6 may interfere with the clinical symptoms of primary HHV-6B infection.
