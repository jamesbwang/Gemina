  Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> ( LM) is a foodborne Gram-positive intracellular pathogen that can cause listeriosis<disease> in humans and animals. Although phagocytes are known to be involved in the response to this infection , the role of neutrophils is not entirely clear. Here , we have demonstrated that soon after LM infection , a large number of IFN-γ-producing neutrophils quickly accumulated in the spleen , blood , and peritoneal cavity. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that neutrophils were an important source of IFN-γ. IFN-γ played a critical protective role against acute LM infection , as demonstrated by the poor survival of Ifng
