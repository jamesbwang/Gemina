  To analyze the prevalence and etiologic agent of Salmonella<pathogen> in livestock and poultry meats , so as to provide data support for controlling contamination and effectively tracing of Salmonella. Livestock and poultry meats from 8 counties in Huaian from 2015 to 2016 were collected and analyzed for the occurrence of Salmonella according national testing standards. Then the serotype distribution , antimicrobial resistance , virulence gene and molecular subtyping traits of isolated strains were characterized. Of the total 368 samples , 37 ( 10. 05 %) tested positive for Salmonella<pathogen> And the positive rate of chicken , duck , pork , beef and mutton were 14. 14 % ( 14/99) , 11. 11 % ( 10/90) , 10. 34 % ( 12/116) and 1. 59 % ( 1/63) , respectively. 37 Salmonella<pathogen> isolates were separated into 8 serotypes and the main serotypes wereSalmonella enteritidis<pathogen> and Salmonella<disease> typhimurium<pathogen>. The antimicrobial resistance test indicated Salmonella isolates showed highest resistance to ampicillin and nalidixic acid ( 72. 97 %) , showed lowest resistance to cefoxitin ( 8. 11 %). And the resistance phenotypes of Salmonella isolates from different samples and serotypes were different. The carriage rate of inv H and sop E were highest in Salmonella<disease> enteritidis<pathogen> and the highest rates of inv H , sop E and rhu M in Salmonella<disease> typhimurium<pathogen>. PFGE showed that the pattern similarity of all Salmonella<disease> enteritidis<pathogen> was more than 81. 56 % and the relationship between the strains with the same source was closer. PFGE pattern of Salmonella<disease> typhimurium<pathogen> were different. The contamination with Salmonella<pathogen> of livestock and poultry meats in Huaian was serious , and the main serotypes were Salmonella<disease> enteritidis<pathogen> and Salmonella<disease> typhimurium<pathogen>. Salmonella<disease> isolates showed high drug resistance and high carriage rate of virulence genes.
