  Chuxiong , known as `` the City of Fungi<pathogen> , '' is rich in fungal resources and traditional knowledge related to fungal biodiversity. The local environment is an excellent habitat for a wide variety of edible fungi<pathogen> In addition , the region is home to many ethnic minorities and especially the Yi ethnic group who has a long history for traditionally using fungi<pathogen> as food or medicine. The aims of this review are to provide up-to-date information on the knowledge about , and traditional management of , fungi<pathogen> in this area and give advice on future utilization and conservation. Field surveys and in-depth semi-structured interviews were used to gather data. Ethnomycological data was collected from 67 informants in the summer of 2015. Twenty-two edible fungal species were recorded both as food or non-timber forest<disease> products ( NTFPs) , used to increase income , and the importance of this resource for the Yi ethnic group was evaluated. Abundant and diverse wild genetic resources and a large production chain of edible fungi<pathogen> were recorded in Chuxiong. However , because of over-harvesting , the wild edible fungi<pathogen> are facing increasing threats. Suggestions are proposed to allow sustainable use of fungi<pathogen> resources , including ( 1) promotion of diversification of transportation , ( 2) development of fungi<pathogen> cultivation to improve quality and supply and reduce harvest pressure , ( 3) improvement of public awareness for environmental protection and sustainable development , and ( 4) promotion of eco-tourism and development of fungi<pathogen> catering in rural agro- and slow-food tourism.
