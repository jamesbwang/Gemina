  Endotoxin tolerance develops in the late phase of sepsis<disease> to protect cells from an early hyperinflammatory response. Nonetheless , because it induces an immunosuppressive environment , patients with sepsis<disease> in its late phase are affected by secondary infections , particularly bacterial pneumonia<disease> Here , we showed that induction of endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) stress leads to activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β ( GSK-3β) and X-box-binding protein 1 ( XBP-1) in an inositol-requiring enzyme 1α ( IRE1α)- mediated manner , which in turn restores the inflammatory response in endotoxin-tolerant macrophages. Animal and in vitro models of endotoxin tolerance were studied along with a model of LPS-induced endotoxin tolerance and a model of cecal ligation and puncture ( CLP)- induced endotoxin tolerance. To detect the suppressed inflammatory response during endotoxin tolerance , inflammatory-cytokine expression levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and an ELISA. Our research revealed that induction of ER stress alleviated lung injury in a septic host infected with Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> via the activation of GSK-3β and XBP-1 in an IRE1α-mediated manner. Consequently , in the lungs of the septic host infected with P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> , symptoms of pneumonia<disease> improved and the infecting bacteria were cleared. Thus , for septic patients , determination of immune status may guide the selection of appropriate immunomodulation , and ER stress can be a novel therapeutic strategy restoring the immune response in patients with endotoxin tolerance.
