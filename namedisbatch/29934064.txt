  Gaucher disease ( GD) is an inherited disorder in which mutations in the GBA1 gene lead to deficient Î²-glucocerebrosidase activity and accumulation of its substrate glucosylceramide. Bone disease is present in around 84 % of GD patients , ranging from bone loss including osteopenia and osteonecrosis to abnormal bone remodelling in the form of Erlenmeyer flask formation. The range of severity and variety of types<pathogen> of bone disease found in GD patients indicate the involvement of several mechanisms. Here we investigate the effects of exogenous sphingolipids on osteoclasts , osteoblasts , plasma cells and mesenchymal stem cells ( MSC) and the interactions between these cell types. Osteoclasts were differentiated from the peripheral blood of Gaucher patients and control subjects. Osteoblasts were differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells isolated from bone<disease> marrow aspirates of Gaucher patients and control subjects. The human osteoblast cell line SaOS-2 was also investigated. Osteoclasts , osteoblasts and a human myeloma plasma cell line NCI-H929 were cultured with relevant exogenous sphingolipids to assess effects on cellular viability and function. Calcium deposition by osteoblasts differentiated from Gaucher patient MSC 's was on average only 11.4 % of that deposited by control subject osteoblasts. Culture with glucosylsphingosine reduced control subject MSC viability by 10.4 % , SaOS-2 viability by 17.4 % and plasma cell number by 40 %. Culture with glucosylceramide decreased calcium deposition by control MSC-derived osteoblasts while increasing control subject osteoclast generation by 55.6 % , Gaucher patient osteoclast generation by 37.6 % and plasma cell numbers by up to 29.7 %. Excessive osteoclast number and activity and reduced osteoblast activity may have the overall effect of an uncoupling between osteoclasts and osteoblasts in the GD bone microenvironment.
