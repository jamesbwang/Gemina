  Lyme<disease> disease<disease> is caused by spirochaetes of the Borrelia<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> sensu lato genospecies. Complete genome assemblies are available for fewer than ten strains of Borrelia<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> sensu stricto , the primary cause of Lyme<disease> disease<disease> in North<pathogen> America. MM1 is a sensu stricto strain originally isolated in the midwestern United States. Aside from a small number of genes , the complete genome sequence of this strain has not been reported. Here we present the complete genome sequence of MM1 in relation to other sensu stricto strains and in terms of its Multi Locus Sequence Typing. Our results indicate that MM1 is a new sequence type which contains a conserved main chromosome and 15 plasmids. Our results include the first contiguous 28.5 kb assembly of lp28-8 , a linear plasmid carrying the vls antigenic variation system , from a Borrelia<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> sensu stricto strain.
