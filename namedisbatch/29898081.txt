  Neurocysticercosis ( NCC) is one of the parasitic infections that most affects the central nervous system. The knowledge regarding its immunopathogenesis and pathophysiology needs broadening. Taenia<pathogen> crassiceps cysticerci are used as the NCC experimental model. The aim of this work was to describe the general pathological processes and the in situ cytokine profile in C57BL/6 mice inoculated intracranially with viable T. crassiceps cysticerci. The histopathology analysis showed cysticerci in the extraparenchymal and intraventricular region , mononuclear inflammatory infiltration surrounding the parasite , microgliosis and meningitis<disease> The analysis of the in situ immune profiles showed a predominance of the Th2 response. The IL-4 and IL-10 dosages were significantly increased in the infected group. The decrease in the INF-gamma dosage reflects the immunomodulation from the cysticerci. In conclusion , a T. crassiceps NCC infection in C57BL/6 mice triggers an inflammatory response , a predominance of Th2 type in situ profile , with mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration , meningitis<disease> and microgliosis.
