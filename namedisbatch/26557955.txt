  Female sex workers ( FSW) bear a high burden of sexually transmitted infections ( STI). In this paper , we estimate the prevalence of human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) , HBV = hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) , HCV<pathogen> = hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) , syphilis<disease> and co-infections in the second Biological and Behavioral Surveillance Survey among FSW in Brazil. The survey was conducted in 12 Brazilian cities from July to November 2016. We used respondent-driven sampling ( RDS) to recruit 350 FSW in each city. Rapid tests were used for screening HIV<pathogen> , syphilis<disease> , HCV<pathogen> , and HBV. Confirmatory tests were performed on all samples with reactive rapid test result. All testing algorithms and interpretations were done according to the recommendations of the Department of STI/AIDS and viral hepatitis<disease> , Ministry of Health. The STI diagnoses were given by: confirmed HIV<pathogen> infection by a positive result on Western blot; active syphilis<disease> infection , defined by a RPR titer equal or greater than 1/8; viremia period of HBV and HCV<pathogen> infections , characterized by a detectable ( or quantifiable) viral load. Prevalence estimates and standard errors were calculated using statistical procedures suitable for data collected by RDS. Excluding the seeds , 4245 FSW were enrolled. Prevalence estimates were: HIV<pathogen> 5.3 % ( 95 % CI: 4.4 % -6.2 %); active syphilis<disease> 8.5 % ( 95 % CI: 7.3 % -9.7 %); HBV<pathogen> 0.4 % ( 95 % CI: 0.2 % -0.7 %); and , HCV<pathogen> 0.9 % ( 95 % CI: 0.6 % -1.3 %). Among the 4154 FSW tested for the 4 infections , 13.3 %; ( 95 % CI 12.0 % -14.8 %) were diagnosed with at least one of the infections , of which 87.6 % ( 95 % CI: 83.3 % -90.9 %) had single infections. The prevalence of HIV/syphilis co-infection was 1.09 % ( 95 % CI: 0.7 %- 1.6 %) and of HIV/HCV or HBV infections was 0.4 % ( 95 % CI: 0.2 % -0.7 %). Our results reveal the need to conduct more studies to estimate the prevalence of STI and co-infections among FSW in Brazil. Longitudinal trends in the prevalence estimates of HIV<pathogen> and other STI provide information to monitor changes in this high-risk population. Additionally , the study highlights the importance of measuring the hepatitis<disease> burden among FSW living with HIV<pathogen> , and the need of including FSW in all aspects of STI prevention , care , and treatment programs.
