  Here we report the draft genome sequence of Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strain HN503E1II isolated from a nasal sample of an abattoir worker in Cameroon. Bacterial genomic DNA of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> HN503E1II was sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform. Generated reads were de novo assembled using the Qiagen CLC Genomics Workbench. The assembled contigs were annotated and antibiotic resistance genes , virulence factors , plasmids and the sequence type ( ST) were identified. The genome comprised a circular chromosome of 4 674201bp , with a 50.78 % G+C content and several resistance genes associated with resistance to Î²-lactams , fluoroquinolones<disease> , aminoglycosides , sulphonamides , trimethoprim , macrolides and tetracycline. The isolate was assigned to ST10 with 100 % identity among the seven housekeeping genes. In silico analysis also revealed the presence six plasmid types and one virulence factor. The genome sequence reported here will provide valuable information for a better understanding of the genetic structure of the E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> genome in Africa.
