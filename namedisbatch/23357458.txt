  BACKGROUND Thrombophilic gene polymorphism is known to be a risk factor for recurrent pregnancy loss ( RPL) , but few studies have confirmed a possible role of thrombophilic genes polymorphism in RPL risk. This study was conducted to understand the relationship of the mutations of some thrombophilia-associated gene polymorphism ( heterozygous/homozygous) with RPL. We compared patients with 2 abortions<disease> to patients with 3 or more abortions<disease> among Turkish women. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study , patients previously diagnosed with habitual abortus<pathogen> at Obstetrics and Gynecology outpatient clinics in Turkey between 2012 and 2016 were included. In their peripheral blood , we detected factor V Leiden H1299R , prothrombin G20210A , MTHFR C677T , MTHFR A1298C , PAI-1 4G/5G , and PAI-1 4G/4G gene mutations. RESULTS In this study , we have observed statistically meaningful data ( P < 0.01) related to the relationship between RPL and thrombophilia-associated gene polymorphisms such as heterozygous factor V Leiden H1299R , heterozygous prothrombin G20210A , PAI-1 4G/5G , and PAI-1 4G/4G. CONCLUSIONS We found that diagnosis of thrombophilic genes polymorphism is useful to determine the causes of RPL , recognizing that this multifactorial disease can also be influenced by various acquired factors , including reproduction-associated risk factors and prolonged immobilization.
