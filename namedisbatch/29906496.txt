  Multiple myeloma ( MM) is a malignant plasma cell disease and is considered incurable. Annexin A2 ( ANXA2) is closely related to the proliferation and adhesion of MM. Using protein-SELEX , we performed a screen for aptamers that bind GST-ANXA2 from a library , and GST protein was used for negative selection. The enrichment of the ssDNA<pathogen> pool was monitored by filter-binding assay during selection. After nine rounds of screening and high-throughput sequencing , we obtained six candidate aptamers that bind to the ANXA2 protein. The affinities of the candidate aptamers for ANXA2 were determined by ELONA. Binding of aptamer wh6 to the ANXA2 protein and to the MM cell was verified by aptamer pulldown experiment and flow cytometry , respectively. Aptamer wh6 binds the ANXA2 protein with good stability and has a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range. The binding specificity of aptamer wh6 was confirmed in vivo in nude mouse xenografts with MM cells and with MM bone<disease> marrow aspirates. Furthermore , aptamer wh6 can block MM cell adhesion to ANXA2 and block the proliferation of MM cells induced by ANXA2. In summary , wh6 can be considered a promising candidate tool for MM diagnosis and treatment.
