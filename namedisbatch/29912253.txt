  Chronic<disease> wounds<disease> are considered a public health problem that may be complicated by bacterial infections , mainly caused by resistant strains. To study the bacteria prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility in samples from adult patients with chronic<disease> wounds<disease>. Patients treated at National Institute of Wounds Foundation between May and July 2014 , with chronic ulcers<disease> in lower extremities with clinical inflammatory signs were recluted. Samples were cultured in aerobic and anaerobic atmosphere and species identification was performed by API ( Biomerieux) galleries. The in vitro susceptibility was evaluated according to the Kirby Bauer method. From 73 patients , 46 had infected wounds<disease> most of them were venous ulcers<disease> ( 33) with prevalence in polymicrobial infections and 10 with foot-diabetes ulcers<disease> with prevalence in monomicrobial infections ( p ≤ 0.05). Sixty-eight strains were isolated and Enterobacteriaceae were predominant in monomicrobial infection ( p ≤ 0.05) and the other groups were slightly higher in polymicrobial infection. The main species were Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( 24 %) followed by P aeruginosa ( 18 %). Fifty strains ( 77 %) were resistant or multi-resistance. We emphasize resistance of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> to ciprofloxacin ( 50 %) and cefoxitin ( 37.5 %) , thus identifying resistance to methicillin in the community ( CA-SAMR) , all of which are sensitive to cotrimoxazole. Enterobacteria showed sensitivity to amikacin ( 95.5 %) , P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> showed resistance to ciprofloxacin ( 33.3 %) with high sensitivity to gentamicin ( 91.7 %) and amikacin ( 83.3 %) , while Acinetobacter<pathogen> spp showed resistance to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime in 60 % , with 100 % sensitivity to imipenem. 50 % Streptococcus<pathogen> β hemolytic showed resistance to clindamycin and penicillin. These data provide epidemiological information on chronic<disease> wound<disease> infections<disease> , representing support for diagnosis , treatment and management of this pathology.
