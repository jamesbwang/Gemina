  Natural products are a significantly underutilized source of potential treatments against human<disease> disease<disease>. Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) is a prime example of conditions that could be amenable to such treatments as suggested by recent findings. Aiming to identify novel potentially therapeutic approaches against AD , we assessed the effects of Cichorium spinosum<pathogen> and Sideritis scardica extracts , both distinct components of the Mediterranean diet. After the detailed characterization of the extracts ' composition using LC-HRMS methods , they were evaluated on two AD neuronal cell culture models , namely the AβPP overexpressing SH-SY5Y-AβPP and the hyperphosphorylated tau expressing PC12-htau. Initially their effect on cell viability of SH-SY5Y and PC12 cells was examined , and subsequently their downstream effects on AβPP and tau processing pathways were investigated in the SH-SY5Y-AβPP and PC12-htau cells. We found that the S. scardica and C. spinosum<pathogen> extracts have similar effects on tau , as they both significantly decrease total tau , the activation of the GSK3β , ERK1 and/or ERK2 kinases of tau , as well as tau hyperphosphorylation. Furthermore , both extracts appear to promote AβPP processing through the alpha , non-amyloidogenic pathway , albeit through partly different mechanisms. These findings suggest that C. spinosum<pathogen> and S. scardica could have a notable potential in the prevention and/or treatment of AD , and merit further investigations at the in vivo level.
