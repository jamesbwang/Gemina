  Several diagnostic tests are being developed to detect drug resistance in tuberculosis<disease> In line with previous developments detecting rifampicin and isoniazid resistance using microbead-based systems ( spoligoriftyping and TB-SPRINT) , we present here an assay called TB-EFI detecting mutations involved in resistance to ethambutol , fluoroquinolones<disease> and the three classical injectable drugs ( kanamycin , amikacin and capreomycin) in Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> The proposed test includes both wild-type and mutant probes for each targeted locus. Basic analysis can be performed manually. An upgraded interpretation is made available in Excel 2016 Â®. Using a reference set of 61 DNA extracts , we show that TB-EFI provides perfect concordance with pyrosequencing. Concordance between genotypic resistance and phenotypic DST was relatively good ( 72 to 98 % concordance) , with lower efficiency for fluoroquinolones<disease> and ethambutol due to some untargeted mutations. When compared to phenotypical resistance , performances were similar to those obtained with Hain MTBDRsl assay , possibly thanks to the use of automatized processing of data although some mutations involved in fluoroquinolone resistance could not be included. When applied on three uncharacterized sets , phenotype could be predicted for 51 % to 98 % depending on the setting and the drug investigated , detecting one extensively drug-resistant isolate in each of a Pakistan and a Brazilian set of 91 samples , and 9 XDR among 43 multi-resistant Kazakhstan samples. By allowing high-throughput detection of second-line drugs resistance and of resistance to ethambutol that is often combined to second-line treatments , TB-EFI is a cost-effective assay for large-scale worldwide surveillance of resistant tuberculosis<disease> and XDR-TB control.
