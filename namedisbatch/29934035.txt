  Streptococcus<pathogen> suis<pathogen> ( SS) is a major swine pathogen and a serious zoonotic pathogen causing septicemia<disease> and meningitis<disease> in piglets and humans. Using an immunoproteomic approach , we previously brought evidence that ornithine<disease> carbamoytransferase ( OCT) may represent a vaccine candidate to protect against S suis biofilm-related and acute<disease> infections<disease>. In this study , the gene encoding OCT was cloned into the expression vector pET-28a and the recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> BL21. The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the SS OCT was further investigated in a mouse model. The protein was found to be expressed in vivo and elicited high antibody titers following SS infections in mice. An animal challenge experiment with SS showed that 62.5 % of mice immunized with the OCT protein were protected. Using an in vitro competitive adherence inhibition assay of adherence , evidence was obtained that OCT could significantly reduce the number of SS cells adhered to porcine kidney PK-15 cells. The bacterial levels recovered in mice of the OCT immunized group were significantly decreased in some organs , compared with the control group. In summary , our results suggest that the recombinant SS OCT protein , which is involved in bacterial adherence , may efficiently stimulate an immune response conferring protection against SS infections. It may therefore be considered as a potential vaccine candidate , although further studies are necessary to evaluate their use in swine.
