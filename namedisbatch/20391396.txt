  The World Health Organization ( WHO) has classified human zoonotic tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) due to Mycobacterium<pathogen> bovis<pathogen> as a neglected issue in the developing world. In a recent cross-sectional study in Brazil , three of 189 TB patients presented with a coinfection of M.<pathogen> bovis<pathogen> and M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> and were selected as cases for this study. The aim was to evaluate risk factors ( RF) for zoonotic TB in an urban area of Brazil in order to guide preventive programmes. A matched case-control study was carried out nested within a cross-sectional study. For each of the three cases , 14 age- and sex-matched controls ( TB due to M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease>) were selected. Zoonotic potential exposures ( ZE) and extrapulmonary TB ( EPTB) were independently associated with zoonotic TB in multivariate analyses. ZE by occupation and consumption of raw milk and derivative products that place individuals in direct and indirect contact with animals and their excretions/secretions increase the risk for zoonotic TB in Brazil , especially among those with EPTB. Therefore , measures such as efficient control of bovine TB , distribution of pasteurised milk and its derivative products , and the diagnosis and monitoring of zoonotic TB in humans are essential steps , especially in developing countries where bovine TB is enzootic , and further studies are necessary.
