Today , nearly half of the surgeries , including oncology , are performed with minimally invasive methods. In obstetrics and gynecology surgery practice , laparoscopy can now be used in almost all operations. In this video , we performed a laparoscopic evacuation of a 12-week missed abortion<disease> case like a cesarean section at the time of bilateral salpingectomy. A Case report ( Canadian Task Force classification III) SETTING: Tertiary referral center in Bursa , Turkey. 38 years old patient. Laparoscopic evacuation of the pregnancy product ( Like a cesarean section) and bilateral salpingectomy. The local institutional review board approved the video. Gravida: 4 , Parity: 3 The patient was in the twelfth week of her gestation when we diagnosed missed abortion<disease> In situs of the operation , there was a twelfth-week pregnancy filling the pouch of Douglas. We clipped the uterine arteries bilaterally and retracted the bladder flap to create a safe surgical incision in the low anterior segment of the uterus. We used the monopolar cautery to incise the uterus from superior to inferior similar to the low vertical classical uterine incision in the cesarean section. The abortus<pathogen> material was removed with the laparoscopic endobag , and bilateral salpingectomy was performed. Developments in minimally invasive surgery are progressing day by day. As advances in laparoscopic and robotic surgery progress , complicated surgical procedures would be done efficiently.
