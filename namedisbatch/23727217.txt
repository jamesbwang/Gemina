  Quality of life ( QOL) is an important clinical outcome for patients with schizophrenia , and recent studies have focused on subjective QOL. We evaluated the causal relationship between psychosocial aspect of subjective QOL , symptoms , cognitive functions , and salience network ( SN) dysfunction in schizophrenia using structural equation modeling ( SEM). We performed a cross-sectional study of 21 patients with symptomatically stabilized schizophrenia and 21 age- , sex- , and education level-matched healthy controls who underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We evaluated SN dysfunction in schizophrenia using independent component analysis ( ICA). We rated participant psychopathology using the Positive and Negative Syndrome<disease> Scale ( PANSS) , the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia ( BACS) , and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia ( CDSS). We rated psychosocial aspect of subjective QOL using the Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale ( SQLS) psychosocial subscale. We applied SEM to examine the relationships between SN dysfunction , PANSS positive and negative scores , CDSS total scores , BACS composite scores , and SQLS psychosocial subscale scores. In second-level analysis after group ICA , patient group had significant lower right pallidum<pathogen> functional connectivity ( FC) within the SN than the controls did ( Montreal Neurological Institute ( MNI) ( We found a continuous process by which SN dysfunction causes depressed moods that determine psychosocial aspect of subjective QOL in schizophrenia. This is the first report that offers a unified explanation of functional neuroimaging , symptoms , and outcomes. Future studies combining neuroimaging techniques and clinical assessments would elucidate schizophrenia 's pathogenesis.
