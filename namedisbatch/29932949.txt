  Current methodologies used to determine the progression of hepatic fibrosis<disease> rely heavily on liver biopsy , a dangerous and invasive procedure , with semi-subjective analysis of the results of the biopsy. Thus , a new approach is immensely needed for monitoring the progression of liver fibrosis<disease> in Hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) patients. The purpose of this study was to find highly specific and sensitive miRNA biomarkers that can be used to detect different stages of liver fibrosis<disease>. The study consisted of 42 cases of chronic hepatitis<disease> C<disease> ( CHC) with early-stage fibrosis<disease> , 45 cases of CHC with late-stage fibrosis<disease> , and 40 healthy subjects with no CHC or fibrosis<disease> as controls. Expression patterns of 5 miRNAs ( miR-16 , miR-146a , miR-214-5p , miR-221 , and miR-222) were analyzed in each group using TaqMan real-time PCR. Serum levels of miRNA-16 , miRNA-146a , miRNA-221 , and miRNA-222 were all significantly up-regulated in early and late stages of liver fibrosis<disease>. miRNA-222 had the highest sensitivity and specificity values in early and late fibrosis<disease>. miRNA-221 had the second highest sensitivity and specificity with the late-stage fibrosis<disease> group. Furthermore , miRNA-221 showed significant positive correlations with both miRNA-16 and miRNA-146a in the early- and late-stage fibrosis<disease> groups , with the early stage having a stronger correlation. The results indicated that miRNA-16 , miRNA-146a , miRNA-221 , and miRNA-222 can be used to detect the presence of liver fibrosis<disease>. The high sensitivity and specificity of miRNA-222 and miRNA-221 in late-stage fibrosis<disease> indicate promising prognostic biomarkers for HCV-induced liver
