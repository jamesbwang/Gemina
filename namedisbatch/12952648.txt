  The casuarina moth , Lymantria xylina Swinhoe ( Lepidoptera: Erebidae) , is an important pest in the Australian pine tree , Casuarina equisetifolia , forest<disease> in the coastal area of South China. At the same time , as a closely related species of Lymantria dispar<pathogen> L. ( Lepidoptera: Erebidae) , it is also a potential quarantine pest. In the present study , specific primers were designed for identification of L. xylina based on the COI barcoding sequence between L. xylina and four other common forest<disease> pests. A 569-bp fragment was successfully amplified from 40 L. xylina from five geographical populations in four Chinese provinces. In addition , even through the analysis came from five highly diverse populations of L. xylina , the genetic distances ranged from 0.001 to 0.031. The neighbor-joining tree showed that the species from Hubei and Chongqing were clustered within a distinct group.
