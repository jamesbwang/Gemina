  The optimal treatment for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( OPSCC) is controversial. There is increasing evidence that , in selected cases , minimally invasive transoral surgery can offer improved functional outcomes , with equivalent oncologic outcomes , compared to chemoradiotherapy. We report the outcomes of transoral laser microsurgery ( TLM) for treatment of OPSCC at our institution. Patients with OPSCC undergoing TLM at the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital , Cork , between 2010 and 2016 , were identified from an institutional database. Human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) status was determined by p16 immunohistochemistry. Survival outcomes were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Complications following surgery and gastrostomy tube dependence were evaluated. The study cohort consisted of 26 patients , with mean age of 56 years ( range 29-71). Primary tumours were located in the tonsil ( 18) , base of tongue ( 4) and other subsites ( 4). Seventeen cases were p16-positive. Complications included haemorrhage necessitating return to theatre ( 1) and aspiration pneumonia<disease> ( 1). Four patients underwent tracheostomy , all of whom were successfully decannulated. One patient underwent gastrostomy tube insertion during postoperative radiotherapy. No patient was gastrostomy dependent at latest follow-up. Twenty-two patients received adjuvant treatment , with radiation alone ( 21) or chemoradiotherapy ( 2). Mean follow-up was 27 months. Five-year locoregional control was 92 % and disease-specific survival was 81 %. In selected patients with OPSCC , TLM offers excellent functional and survival outcomes , and as such offers an alternative approach to chemoradiotherapy as primary treatment. We compare TLM to other transoral approaches and discuss its potential use in the Irish healthcare system.
