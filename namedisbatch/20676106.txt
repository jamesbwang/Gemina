  MicroRNAs are implicated in many cellular processes such as cell differentiation and development , tumorigenesis , and immune regulation. In this study , miR192 was detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) when MDBK cells were exposed to Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> Cells with malfunction of bta-miR-192 were established using transcription activator-like effector nuclease ( TALEN) technology. Finally , bta-miR-192 mutant cells were screened for differentially expressed genes using RNA-sequencing ( RNA-seq). The results showed that miR192 significantly decreased in cells exposed to E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> F18ac and E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> K88ac. The RNA-seq results showed that 1673 differentially expressed transcripts were identified; 890 genes were upregulated and 775 genes were downregulated. With the gene ontology enrichment analysis , 431 differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) were classified into 937 gene ontology terms. The pathway enrichment analysis showed that 535 genes were involved in 254 pathway terms. Interestingly , most of these DEGs were associated with the pathways in cancers or infectious<disease> diseases<disease>. When the selected DEGs ( n = 162) in these pathways were intersected with 120 differential transcripts , 11 DEGs were identified. Subsequently , several genes associated with regulation , cancers , or viral<disease> infections<disease> , such as LEF1 , AXIN2 , MX1 , and FCGR2B , were identified among the DEGs using functional analysis. Furthermore , associations between bta-miR-192 and DEGs were detected by intersecting the bta-miR-192 's target genes with the DEGs , indicating that three genes including CBL , DICER1 and TRERF1 were involved in this relationship. These findings provided useful guidance for investigating the role played by bta-miR-192 in cellular functionality in bovine cells.
