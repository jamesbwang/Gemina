  Tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) remains a major global public health problem. New immunization methods against TB are urgently needed. Plasmid DNA with a microneedle patch is a potentially attractive strategy to improve the immune effect. A DNA vaccine encoding the secreted protein Ag85B of Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> was immunized in the skin using microneedles , which can improve protective immunity compared to conventional intramuscular ( IM) injection. There is no significant difference between microneedle patch ( MNP) and IM immunization when the immunizing dose is low ( 4.2 μg). However , the results for detecting humoral immunity showed MNP immunization could better provoke an antibody response than IM when the dose is high ( 12.6 μg). A similar result was observed in cellular immune responses by measuring the cytokines in splenocytes. The effective protection of MNP can also be demonstrated by counting bacteria and analyzing the survival rate. This study indicated that DNA vaccination in the skin using dissolving microneedles may provide a new strategy against TB.
