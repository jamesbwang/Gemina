  Ticks are an important but under recognized parasitic threat to cats in many areas of the United States. To characterize the species and stages of ticks most commonly recovered from cats and determine the prevalence of disease agents<disease> in the ticks , we conducted a survey of ticks removed from cats at veterinary practices in 18 states from April 2016-June 2017. A total of 796 ticks were submitted from 332 cats from 41 different veterinary practices. A single tick was submitted from the majority of cats , with a mean infestation intensity of 2.4 ( range 1-46). The most common tick was Ixodes<pathogen> scapularis<pathogen> , accounting for 422/796 ( 53.0 %) ticks submitted , followed by Amblyomma<pathogen> americanum<pathogen> ( 224/796; 28.1 %) and Dermacentor<pathogen> variabilis<pathogen> ( 131/796; 16.5 %); a few I.<pathogen> pacificus<pathogen> , I. banksi , D. occidentalis , A.<pathogen> maculatum<pathogen> , Rhipicephalus<pathogen> sanguineus<pathogen> , and Otobius megnini were also submitted. A majority of ticks were adults ( 593/796; 74.5 %); females predominated in all adult tick submissions including I.<pathogen> scapularis<pathogen> ( 277/327; 84.7 % female) , A.<pathogen> americanum<pathogen> ( 66/128; 51.6 % female) , and D.<pathogen> variabilis<pathogen> ( 75/126; 59.5 % female). Immature ticks included 186 nymphs and 17 larvae and were primarily I.<pathogen> scapularis<pathogen> and A.<pathogen> americanum<pathogen>. Adult I.<pathogen> scapularis<pathogen> were most reported to be attached to the dorsal head and neck; A.<pathogen> americanum<pathogen> to the abdomen and perianal region; and D.<pathogen> variabilis<pathogen> to the back and ear. Ticks were collected in every month; the largest number of submissions were in May and June ( 42.5 % of ticks) and October and November ( 35.9 % of ticks). Adults of I.<pathogen> scapularis<pathogen> were most commonly submitted October through December , A.<pathogen> americanum<pathogen> March through June , and D.<pathogen> variabilis<pathogen> May through July. Cats with ticks were predominantly male ( 58.8 %) and altered ( 76.2 %) , and most reportedly spent > 30 % of time outdoors , although 64/294 ( 21.8 %) for which lifestyle estimates were provided were reported to live primarily ( â‰¤ 30 % of time outside; n = 54) or entirely ( 100 %; n = 10) indoors. Assay of ticks removed from cats revealed I.<pathogen> scapularis<pathogen> were infected with Borrelia<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> ( 25.7 %) and Anaplasma<pathogen> phagocytophilum<pathogen> ( 4.4 %); A.<pathogen> americanum<pathogen> were infected with Ehrlichia<pathogen> chaffeensis ( 1.3 %); and D.<pathogen> variabilis<pathogen> were infected with spotted<disease> fever<disease> group Rickettsia<pathogen> spp. ( 3.1 %). No ticks in this study tested positive for Cytauxzoon felis. Pet cats , including those that live primarily indoors , are at risk of tick infestation , potentially exposed to tick-borne disease agents<disease> , and would benefit from routine tick control.
