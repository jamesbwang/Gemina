  The authors developed a practical and clinically useful model to predict the risk of psychosis that utilizes clinical characteristics empirically demonstrated to be strong predictors of conversion to psychosis in clinical high-risk ( CHR) individuals. The model is based upon the Structured Interview for Psychosis Risk Syndromes<disease> ( SIPS) and accompanying clinical interview , and yields scores indicating one 's risk of conversion. Baseline data , including demographic and clinical characteristics measured by the SIPS , were obtained on 199 CHR individuals seeking evaluation in the early detection and intervention for mental disorders program at the New<pathogen> York State Psychiatric Institute at Columbia University Medical Center. Each patient was followed for up to 2 years or until they developed a syndromal DSM-4 disorder. A LASSO logistic fitting procedure was used to construct a model for conversion specifically to a psychotic disorder. At 2 years , 64 patients ( 32.2 %) converted to a psychotic disorder. The top five variables with relatively large standardized effect sizes included SIPS subscales of visual perceptual abnormalities , dysphoric mood , unusual thought content , disorganized communication , and violent ideation. The concordance index ( c-index) was 0.73 , indicating a moderately strong ability to discriminate between converters and non-converters. The prediction model performed well in classifying converters and non-converters and revealed SIPS measures that are relatively strong predictors of conversion , comparable with the risk calculator published by NAPLS ( c-index = 0.71) , but requiring only a structured clinical interview. Future work will seek to externally validate the model and enhance its performance with the incorporation of relevant biomarkers.
