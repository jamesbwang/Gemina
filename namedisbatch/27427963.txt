  Several studies have demonstrated the remarkable properties of microbiota and their metabolites in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>. 10-Hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid ( HYA) , a bioactive metabolite generated by probiotic microorganisms during the process of fatty acid metabolism , has been studied for its protective effects against epithelial barrier impairment in the intestines. Herein , we examined the effect of HYA on gingival epithelial barrier function and its possible application for the prevention and treatment of periodontal<disease> disease<disease> We found that GPR40 , a fatty acid receptor , was expressed on gingival epithelial cells; activation of GPR40 by HYA significantly inhibited barrier impairment induced by Porphyromonas<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> , a representative periodontopathic bacterium<pathogen>. The degradation of E-cadherin and beta-catenin , basic components of the epithelial barrier , was prevented in a GPR40-dependent manner in vitro. Oral inoculation of HYA in a mouse experimental periodontitis<disease> model suppressed the bacteria-induced degradation of E-cadherin and subsequent inflammatory cytokine production in the gingival tissue. Collectively , these results suggest that HYA exerts a protective function , through GPR40 signaling , against periodontopathic bacteria-induced gingival epithelial barrier impairment and contributes to the suppression of inflammatory responses in
