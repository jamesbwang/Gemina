  Shigella<pathogen> is a common cause of diarrhoea<disease> in Papua New Guinea ( PNG) and other Oceania countries. However , little is known about the strains causing infection. Archived Shigella<pathogen> isolates ( n = 72) were obtained from research laboratories in PNG and reference laboratories in Australia. Shigella<pathogen> virulence genes were detected by PCR , and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion. The ipaH virulence gene was present in all 72 isolates. The prevalence of other virulence genes was variable , with ial , invE , ipaBCD , sen/ospD3 and virF present in 60 % of isolates and set1A and set1B genes present in 42 % of isolates. Most S.<pathogen> flexneri<pathogen> isolates contained genes encoding enterotoxin 1 and/or enterotoxin 2. Resistance to antibiotics was common , with 51/72 isolates resistant to 2-4 antimicrobials. A greater proportion of bacteria isolated since 2010 ( relative to pre-2010 isolates) were resistant to commonly used antibiotics such as ampicillin , chloramphenicol , tetracycline , and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; suggesting that antimicrobial resistance ( AMR) in Shigella is increasing over time in the Oceania region. There is a need for improved knowledge regarding Shigella<pathogen> circulation in the Oceania region and further monitoring of AMR patterns.
