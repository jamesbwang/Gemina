  Foot and mouth<disease> disease<disease> is an economically important transboundary disease of wildlife and cloven hoofed animals including ruminants. In the absence of vaccination , detection of antibodies against structural proteins ( SPs) of foot-and-mouth disease<pathogen> virus<pathogen> is an indicator of infection. In the present study , a rapid dot blot assay using gold nanoparticlees was developed for the detection of antibodies against SPs of FMDV. Commercially available FMD vaccine was used as a source of FMD antigen. After the synthesis of gold nanoparticles ( GNPs) , the GNP-dot blot assay was tested and was found very sensitive , as the detection of antibody was up to 10
