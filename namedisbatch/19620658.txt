  Nontyphoidal Salmonella<pathogen> infections contribute to approximately 1.2 million annual illnesses in the United States. Historical and recent outbreaks have been associated with dairy products , ground beef , and direct contact with cattle. Salmonella<pathogen> antimicrobial resistance ( AMR) is a serious concern that can reduce successful treatment of infections , increasing recovery time , medical costs , and mortality rates in humans and animals. This highlights the need to track AMR in Salmonella isolated from cattle to improve treatment plans , manage trends in AMR , and prevent future AMR development. A total of 242 Salmonella<pathogen> isolates were retrieved from 9,162 cattle fecal samples submitted to the University of California , Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital from 2002 to 2016. These isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using a standardized broth dilution panel. Multidrug resistance ( MDR) to three or more classes of antimicrobials was observed in 50.8 % of isolates , and the most common MDR pattern was amoxicillin-ampicillin-cefoxitin-ceftiofur-ceftriaxone-chloramphenicol-streptomycin-tetracycline ( 23.2 %). There were significantly greater odds for antimicrobial resistance to aminoglycosides ( OR: 2.03 , 95 % CI: 1.1-3.7) , penicillins ( OR: 1.87 , 95 % CI: 1.007-3.5) , and tetracyclines ( OR: 1.87 , 95 % CI: 1.017-3.4) for the 2002-2009 period when compared to the 2010-2016 period. The most prevalent MDR serotypes were Newport ( 100 % MDR , n = 52) , Typhimurium<pathogen> ( 100 % , n = 20) , and Dublin ( 71 % MDR , n = 46). Risk factors associated with higher odds for isolating MDR Salmonella included isolates from calves when compared to adult cattle ( OR: 22.0; 95 % C.I.: 3.9-125.7) , and isolates obtained from cattle suspect of having salmonellosis versus from the infectious<disease> disease<disease> control surveillance program ( OR: 13.7; 95 % C.I.: 2.8-66.8). Despite a temporal trend for reduced AMR to most antimicrobial drug classes , a lack of this observed in the 2002-2009 period when compared to the 2010-2016 period for important drug classes such as cephalosporins ( OR: 1.6 , 95 % CI: 0.87-3.1) , and a trend for temporal increase in resistant to quinolones drugs ( P value 0.004) highlight the relevance of AMR surveillance in cattle with Salmonella infections with the aim of targeting future prophylactic interventions.
