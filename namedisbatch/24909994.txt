  Antiviral responses are barriers that must be overcome for efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy. In mammalian cells , antiviral responses involve the interferon pathway , a protein-signaling cascade that alerts the immune system and limits virus propagation. Tumour-specific defects in interferon signaling enhance viral<disease> infection<disease> and responses to oncolytic virotherapy , but many human cancers are still refractory to oncolytic viruses. Given that invertebrates , fungi<pathogen> and plants rely on RNA interference pathways for antiviral protection , we investigated the potential involvement of this alternative antiviral mechanism in cancer cells. Here , we detected viral genome-derived small RNAs , indicative of RNAi-mediated antiviral responses , in human cancer cells. As viruses may encode suppressors of the RNA interference pathways , we engineered an oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus variant to encode the Nodamura virus protein B2 , a known inhibitor of RNAi-mediated immune responses. B2-expressing oncolytic virus showed enhanced viral replication and cytotoxicity , impaired viral genome cleavage and altered microRNA processing in cancer cells. Our data establish the improved therapeutic potential of our novel virus which targets the RNAi-mediated antiviral defense of cancer cells.
