  The incidence of oropharyngeal<disease> squamous cell carcinoma ( OPSCC) has been rising in Western countries and this has been attributed to human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) infection. p16 expression is a marker for HPV<pathogen> infection and p16 positive OPSCC is now recognized as a separate disease entity. There are only limited data available regarding HPV-related OPSCC in Asian countries and no data from Malaysia. We identified 60 Malaysian patients with OPSCC over a 12-year period ( 2004-2015) from four different hospitals in two major cities , Kuala Lumpur and Penang. The detection of HPV<pathogen> was carried out using p16 immunohistochemistry and high risk HPV<pathogen> DNA in situ hybridisation. Overall , 15 ( 25 %) tumours were p16 positive by immunohistochemistry , 10 of which were also positive for high risk HPV<pathogen> DNA by in situ hybridisation. By comparison , a matched cohort of UK patients had a p16 positive rate of 49 %. However , between 2009 and 2015 , where cases were available from all four hospitals , 13 of 37 ( 35 %) cases were p16 positive. In our Malaysian cohort , 53 % of patients were of Chinese ethnicity and 80 % of the p16 positive cases were found in these patients; no Indian patients had p16 positive disease , despite representing 35 % of the total cohort. The proportion of OPSCCs associated with HPV<pathogen> in Malaysia appears to be lower than in European and American cohorts and could possibly be more prevalent amongst Malaysians of Chinese ethnicity. Further , our data suggests that the burden of HPV-related OPSCC could be increasing in Malaysia. Larger cross-sectional studies of Malaysian patients are required to determine the public health implications of these preliminary findings.
