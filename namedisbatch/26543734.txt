  Burkholderia<pathogen> pseudomallei<pathogen> is a flagellated , gram-negative environmental bacterium<pathogen> that causes melioidosis<disease> , a severe infectious<disease> disease<disease> of humans and animals in tropical areas. We hypothesised that B.<pathogen> pseudomallei<pathogen> may undergo phenotypic adaptation in response to an increase in growth temperature. We analysed the growth curves of B.<pathogen> pseudomallei<pathogen> strain 153 cultured in Luria-Bertani broth at five different temperatures ( 25 °C -42 °C) and compared the proteomes of bacteria cultured at 37 °C and 42 °C. B.<pathogen> pseudomallei<pathogen> exhibited the highest growth rate at 37 °C with modest reductions at 30 °C , 40 °C and 42 °C but a more marked delay at 25 °C. Proteome analysis revealed 34 differentially expressed protein spots between bacterial cultures at 42 °C versus 37 °C. These were identified as chaperones ( 7 spots) , metabolic enzymes ( 12 spots) , antioxidants ( 10 spots) , motility proteins ( 2 spots) , structural proteins ( 2 spots) and hypothetical proteins ( 1 spot). Of the 22 down-regulated proteins at 42 °C , redundancy in motility and antioxidant proteins was observed. qRT-PCR confirmed decreased expression of fliC and katE. Experiments on three B.<pathogen> pseudomallei<pathogen> strains demonstrated that these had the highest motility , greatest resistance to H
