  A single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) in the interleukin 28B ( IL28B) gene may alter the trajectory of hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) chronic<disease> infection<disease>. Several studies have sought to determine a link between the IL28B rs12979860 SNP and the development of HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) , but with variable results , consensus is awaited. We hypothesised that IL28B rs12979860 SNP is linked to HCC in patients with HCV<pathogen> type 4. IL28B genotyping of 300 patients with HCV<pathogen> related fibrosis<disease> ( n = 100) , cirrhosis ( n = 100) and HCC ( n = 100) was carried out and the results were analyzed to determine the association between the IL28B genotype and clinical outcome. In IL28B TT genotype carriers , proportions of moderate/severe fibrosis<disease> , advanced cirrhosis ( Child B-C) and HCC ( 50 % , 84 % and 60.2 % , respectively) were higher ( P < 0.05) than in CC/CT ( 4.3 % , 46 % and 23 % , respectively). IL-28B SNP was linked significantly ( P < 0.05) with cirrhosis progression and HCC advanced stages. Moreover , HCC advanced Child , Okuda and CLIP stages were associated with T allele carriage ( 73.9 % , 82.6 % and 78.3 % vs. 44.2 % , 50.6 % and 46.8 % in CC/CT). Percent of large tumor size ( > 3 cm) increase ( P = 0.028) in TT genotype carriers ( 81.8 % vs. 52.6 % in CC/CT). IL-28B rs12979860 TT genotype is more prevalent in patients with advanced fibrosis<disease> , cirrhosis and HCC stages. Thus , it seems to be associated with poor outcomes in chronic HCV<pathogen> patients and to augment the risk of developing HCC.
