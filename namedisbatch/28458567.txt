  Three of the eight RNA segments encoded by the influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( IAV<pathogen>) undergo alternative splicing to generate distinct proteins. Previously , we found that host proteins hnRNP K and NS1-BP regulate IAV<pathogen> M segment splicing , but the mechanistic details were unknown. Here we show NS1-BP and hnRNP K bind M mRNA downstream of the M2 5 ' splice site ( 5 ` ss). NS1-BP binds most proximal to the 5 ` ss , partially overlapping the U1 snRNP binding site , while hnRNP K binds further downstream and promotes U1 snRNP recruitment. Mutation of either or both the hnRNP K and NS1-BP-binding sites results in M segment mis-splicing and attenuated IAV<pathogen> replication. Additionally , we show that hnRNP K and NS1-BP regulate host splicing events and that viral<disease> infection<disease> causes mis-splicing of some of these transcripts. Therefore , our proposed mechanism of hnRNP K/NS1-BP mediated IAV<pathogen> M splicing provides potential targets of antiviral intervention and reveals novel host functions for these proteins.
