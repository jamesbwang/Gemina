  Family-centered prevention is effective at reducing risk behavior throughout the life span and promoting healthy development. Despite research that suggests parents continue to play a significant role in the lives of their children during emerging adulthood , very few studies have examined effective family-centered strategies for preventing risk behavior in young adults. Typical prevention efforts for this age group have focused on college students and substance use prevention , with no integration of families or systems of support that may sustain the effects of the intervention. In this study , we evaluated a version of the Family Check-Up ( FCU) that was adapted for young adults and their families , the Young Adult<disease> Family Check-Up ( YA-FCU). Families were randomly assigned to receive the FCU or school as usual during the middle school years. Ten years later , they were offered the YA-FCU , which was adapted for families of emerging adult children. Intent-to-treat and complier average causal effect analyses were used to examine change in young adult risk behavior approximately 1 year after receiving the YA-FCU. Analyses indicated that random assignment alone or simple engagement was not associated with reductions in young adult risk behavior. However , dose-response analyses indicated that the more hours that youth and families were engaged in the YA-FCU , the greater the reductions in young adult risk behavior relative to those who did not engage or engaged very little in the intervention , resulting in a medium<pathogen> effect size of the YA-FCU on risk behavior.
