  Eukaryotic pathogens must survive in different hosts , respond to changing environments , and exploit specialized niches to propagate. Plasmodium<pathogen> parasites cause human malaria<disease> during bloodstream infections , where they must persist long enough to be transmitted. Parasites have evolved diverse strategies of variant gene expression that control critical biological processes of blood-stage infections , including antigenic variation , erythrocyte invasion , innate immune evasion , and nutrient acquisition , as well as life-cycle transitions. Epigenetic mechanisms within the parasite are being elucidated , with discovery of epigenomic marks associated with gene silencing and activation , and the identification of epigenetic regulators and chromatin proteins that are required for the switching and maintenance of gene expression. Here , we review the key epigenetic processes that facilitate transition through the parasite life cycle and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms utilized by Plasmodium<pathogen> parasites to survive changing environments and consider epigenetic switching in the context of the outcome of human<disease> infections<disease>.
