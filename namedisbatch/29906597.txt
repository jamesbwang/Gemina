  Automated point-of-care molecular assays have greatly shortened the turnaround time of respiratory<disease> virus<pathogen> testing. One of the major bottlenecks now lies at the step of the specimen collection especially in a busy clinical setting. Saliva is a convenient specimen type which can be provided easily from adult patients. This study assessed the diagnostic validity , specimen collection time , and cost associated with the use of saliva. This was a prospective diagnostic validity study comparing the detection rate of respiratory viruses between saliva and nasopharyngeal aspirate ( NPA) among adult hospitalized patients using Xpert Between July and October 2017 , 214 patients were recruited. The overall agreement between saliva and NPA were 93.3 % ( 196/210 , Îº 0.851 , 95 % CI 0.776-0.926). There was no significant difference in the detection rate of respiratory viruses between saliva and NPA ( 32.9 % ( 69/210) vs 35.7 % ( 75/210); P = 0.146). The overall sensitivity and specificity were 90.8 % ( 81.9-96.2 %) and 100 % ( 97.3-100 %) , respectively , for saliva , and were 96.1 % ( 88.9-99.2 %) and 98.5 % ( 94.7-99.8 %) , respectively , for NPA. The time and cost associated with the collection of saliva were 2.26-fold and 2.59-fold lower , respectively , than those of NPA. Saliva specimen has high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of respiratory viruses by an automated multiplex Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA)- waived point-of-care molecular assay when compared with that of NPA. The use of saliva also reduces the time and cost associated with specimen collection.
