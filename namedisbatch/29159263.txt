  Astroviruses ( AstVs) are responsible for infection of a large diversity of mammalian and avian species , including bats , aquatic birds , livestock and humans. We investigated AstVs circulation in bats in Mozambique and Mayotte , a small island<disease> in the Comoros Archipelago located between east Africa and Madagascar. Biological material was collected from 338 bats and tested for the presence of the AstV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase gene with a pan-AstV semi-nested polymerase chain reaction assay. None of the 79 samples obtained from Mayotte bats ( Pteropus seychellensis comorensis and Chaerephon pusillus<pathogen>) tested positive; however , 20.1 % of bats sampled in Mozambique shed AstVs at the time of sampling and significant interspecific variation in the proportion of positive bats was detected. Many AstVs sequences obtained from a given bat species clustered in different phylogenetic lineages , while others seem to reflect some level of host-virus association , but also with AstVs previously reported from Malagasy bats. Our findings support active circulation of a large diversity of AstVs in bats in the western Indian Ocean islands , including the southeastern African coast , and highlight the need for more detailed assessment of its risk of zoonotic transmission to human populations.
