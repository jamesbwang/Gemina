  Chemokines are known to play a vital role in guiding and regulating the immune response to viral<disease> infections<disease>. The chemokine CXC subfamily is a major subfamily in the chemokine family. Outcomes of hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection , as well as the response to treatment , depend on virus and host factors. Here we recruited chronic hepatitis<disease> C<disease> ( CHC) patients to perform an association study between three single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) ( CXCR2 rs1126579 , CXCL10 rs8878 and CXCL10 rs3921) and HCV<pathogen> infection outcomes and treatment responses among a Chinese population , using primarily a TaqMan assay. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the influencing factors on HCV<pathogen> infection outcome and treatment response. The results showed that subjects with the CXCR2 rs1126579 TT genotype had a significantly increased possibility of HCV<pathogen> spontaneous clearance ( Dominant model: adjusted OR = 1.32 , 95 % CI = 1.06-1.64; P = 0.013). Additionally , CHC patients carrying the CXCR2 rs1126579 TT genotype were also more likely to achieve a sustained virological response ( SVR) ( Dominant model: adjusted OR = 0.49 , 95 % CI = 0.29-0.84; P = 0.010). We also established a predictive model for HCV<pathogen> treatment response including the CXCR2 rs1126579 SNP status , albumin ( ALB) levels and baseline HCV<pathogen> RNA levels , which produced an area under the curve ( AUC) of about 0.660. These findings highlight that variant CXCR2 rs1126579 genotypes are associated with HCV<pathogen> clearance within the Chinese population.
