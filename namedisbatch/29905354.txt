  Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common cancer with over 500000 annually reported incident cases worldwide. Besides major risk factors tobacco and alcohol , oropharyngeal<disease> squamous cell carcinomas ( OSCC) show increased association with human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>). HPV-associated and HPV-negative OSCC are 2 different entities regarding biological characteristics , therapeutic response , and patient prognosis. In HPV<pathogen> OSCC , viral oncoprotein activity , as well as genetic ( mutations and chromosomal aberrations) and epigenetic alterations plays a key role during carcinogenesis. Based on improved treatment response , the introduction of therapy de-intensification and targeted therapy is discussed for patients with HPV<pathogen> OSCC. A promising targeted therapy concept is immunotherapy. The use of checkpoint inhibitors ( e.g. anti-PD1) is currently investigated. By means of liquid biopsies , biomarkers such as viral DNA or tumor mutations in the will soon be available for disease monitoring , as well as detection of treatment failure. By now , primary prophylaxis of HPV<pathogen> OSCC can be achieved by vaccination of girls and boys.
