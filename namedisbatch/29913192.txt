  The activity , stability , and kinetics of immobilized enzymes are influenced by the nature of the support or carrier material. In this research , zinc oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by chemical precipitation , and the purified protease from shrimp<disease> Penaeus<pathogen> vanamei was immobilized on the nanoparticles. Size , structure , and morphology of the ZnO nanoparticles , and the immobilization of the protease were studied by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) , Fourier transform infrared ( FT-IR) spectroscopy , UV-Vis spectroscopy , and dynamic light scattering ( DLS). The immobilization of protease on ZnO nanoparticles improved the long-term and thermal stability , plus its stability at extreme pH values , and it increased the optimum functional temperature of the enzyme. The optimum pH value of the immobilized protease was shifted from 7.0 to 8.0 upon immobilization. Additionally , and due to the immobilization an increased K
