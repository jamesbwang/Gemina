  Influenza<disease> A<pathogen> and B viruses can continuously evade humoral immune responses by developing mutations in the globular head of the hemagglutinin ( HA) that prevent antibody binding. However , the influenza<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> HA over time displays less antigenic variation despite being functionally and structurally similar to the influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> HA. To determine if the influenza<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> HA is under constraints that limit its antigenic variation , we performed a transposon screen to compare the mutational tolerance of the currently circulating influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> HAs ( H1 and H3 subtypes) and influenza<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> HAs ( B/Victoria87 and B/Yamagata88 antigenic lineages). A library of insertional mutants for each HA was generated and deep sequenced after passaging to determine where insertions were tolerated in replicating viruses. The head domains of both viruses tolerated transposon mutagenesis , but the influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> head was more tolerant to insertions than the influenza<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> head domain. Furthermore , all five of the known antigenic sites of the influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> HA were tolerant of 15 nucleotide insertions , while insertions were detected in only two of the four antigenic sites in the influenza<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> head domain. Our analysis demonstrated that the influenza<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> HA is inherently less tolerant of transposon mediated insertions than the influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> HA. The reduced insertional tolerance of the influenza<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> HA may reveal genetic restrictions resulting in a lower capacity for antigenic evolution.
