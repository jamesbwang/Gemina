  Pediatric community associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( CA-MRSA) infections are emerging worldwide. High CA-MRSA carriage rates were previously described in healthy Bedouin children. We assessed demographic , clinical and molecular characteristics of pediatric MRSA infections in southern Israel. The Soroka University Medical Center laboratory serves the entire population of southern Israel , divided into two ethnic groups , Bedouins and Jews. All in-hospital MRSA clinical isolates from children 0-18 years old , obtained in 2016 were included. Health-care associated ( HA) and CA infections were defined according to the CDC case definition. All isolates were evaluated for staphylococcal-cassette chromosome ( SCCmec) , Panton-Valentine leukocidin ( PVL) , S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> protein A ( spa) type , pulsed-field-gel-electrophoresis ( PFGE) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Overall , 95 MRSA isolates ( 18 % of all S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>) , with 25 different MRSA strains were identified. 28 isolates ( 29.5 % of MRSA) belonged to the pediatric clone , rarely observed in Israel , SCCmec IV , PVL positive , spa-type 002. All isolates demonstrated identical PFGE fingerprints. Eighty-two percent of infections caused by this clone were community-acquired , mainly observed in young Bedouin children , causing skin and soft<disease> tissue<disease> infections<disease> ( SSTI). The new clone infections characteristics were similar to those of other CA-MRSA. All isolates of the pediatric clone were susceptible to trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole , ciprofloxacin , gentamicin , tetracycline , rifampicin and vancomycin; 17.8 % were nonsusceptible to erythromycin and clindamycin. The pediatric CA-MRSA clone , previously described only in sporadic cases in Israel , is emerging among healthy , young Bedouin children , typically causing SSTI. Isolates are susceptible to a variety of non-beta lactam antibiotics.
