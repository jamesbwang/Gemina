  CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing is addressing key limitations in the transfection of malaria<disease> parasites. While this method has already simplified the needed molecular cloning and reduced the time required to generate mutants in the human pathogen Plasmodium<pathogen> falciparum<pathogen> , optimal selection of required guide RNAs and guidelines for successful transfections have not been well characterised , leading workers to use time-consuming trial and error approaches. We used a genome-wide computational approach to create a comprehensive and publicly accessible database of possible guide RNA sequences in the P.<pathogen> falciparum<disease> genome. For each guide , we report on-target efficiency and specificity scores as well as information about the genomic site relevant to optimal design of CRISPR-Cas9 transfections to modify , disrupt , or conditionally knockdown any gene. As many antimalarial drug and vaccine targets are encoded by multigene families , we also developed a new paralog specificity score that should facilitate modification of either a single family member of interest or multiple paralogs that serve overlapping roles. Finally , we tabulated features of successful transfections in our laboratory , providing broadly useful guidelines for parasite transfections. Molecular studies aimed at understanding parasite biology or characterising drug and vaccine targets in P.<pathogen> falciparum<disease> should be facilitated by this comprehensive database.
