  Human immunodeficiency virus-1 ( HIV-1) is a viral<disease> infectious<disease> agent<disease> that gradually extinguishes the immune system , resulting in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome<disease> ( AIDS). The aim of this study was to develop a TaqMan based detection assay to evaluate HIV-1 plasma viral load and to construct a stable internal positive control ( IPC) and external positive control ( EPC) RNA based on Armored RNA ( AR) technology. The MS2 maturase , coat protein gene and HIV-1 pol gene were cloned in pET-32a plasmid. The recently fabricated recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strain BL2 ( DE3) and protein expression and Armored RNA was fabricated in presence of isopropyl-L-thio-D-galactopyranoside ( IPTG). The Armored RNA was precipitated and purified by polyethylene glycol ( PEG) and sephacryl S-200 chromatography. The stability of Armored RNA was evaluated by treatment with DNase I and RNase A and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) and gel agarose electrophoresis. The specificity , sensitivity , inter- and intra-day precision , and the dynamic range of the assay were experimentally determined. The AR was stable in presence of ribonuclease , and the assay had a dynamic detection range from 101 to 105 copies of AR. The coefficient of variation ( CV) was 4.8 % for intra-assay and 5.8 % for inter-assay precision. Clinical specificity and sensitivity of the assay were assessed at 100 % and 96.66 % , respectively. The linear regression analysis confirmed a high correlation between the in-house and the commercial assay , Real Star HIV-1-qRTPCR , respectively ( R2 = 0.888). The AR standard is non-infectious and highly resistant in the presence of ribonuclease. The TaqMan assay developed is able to quantify HIV<pathogen> viral load based on a novel conserved region of HIV-1 pol gene which has minimal sequence inconsistency.
