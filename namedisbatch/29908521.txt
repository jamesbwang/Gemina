  Community-acquired pneumonia<disease> ( CAP) causes a major burden to the health care system among children under-5 years worldwide. Information on respiratory viruses in non-severe CAP cases is scarce. To estimate the frequency of respiratory viruses among non-severe CAP cases. Prospective study conducted in Salvador , Brazil. Out of 820 children aged 2-59 months with non-severe CAP diagnosed by pediatricians ( respiratory complaints and radiographic pulmonary infiltrate/consolidation) , recruited in a clinical trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01200706) , nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were obtained from 774 ( 94.4 %) patients and tested for 16 respiratory viruses by PCRs. Viruses were detected in 708 ( 91.5 %; 95 % CI: 89.3-93.3) cases , out of which 491 ( 69.4 %; 95 % CI: 65.9-72.7) harbored multiple viruses. Rhinovirus<pathogen> ( 46.1 %; 95 % CI: 42.6-49.6) , adenovirus<pathogen> ( 38.4 %; 95 % CI: 35.0-41.8) , and enterovirus<pathogen> ( 26.5 %; 95 % CI: 23.5-29.7) were the most commonly found viruses. The most frequent combination comprised rhinovirus<pathogen> plus adenovirus<pathogen>. No difference was found in the frequency of RSVA ( 16.1 % vs. 14.6 %; P = 0.6) , RSVB ( 10.9 % vs. 13.2 %; P = 0.4) influenza<disease> ( Flu) A ( 6.3 % vs. 5.1 %; P = 0.5) , FluB ( 4.5 % vs. 1.8 %; P = 0.09) , parainfluenza virus ( PIV) 1 ( 5.1 % vs. 2.8 %; P = 0.2) , or PIV4 ( 7.7 % vs. 4.1 %; P = 0.08) , when children with multiple or sole virus detection were compared. Conversely , rhinovirus<pathogen> , adenovirus<pathogen> , enterovirus<pathogen> , bocavirus<pathogen> , PIV2 , PIV3 , metapneumovirus<pathogen> , coronavirus<pathogen> OC43 , NL63<pathogen> , 229E<pathogen> were significantly more frequent among cases with multiple virus detection. Respiratory viruses were detected in over 90 % of the cases , out of which 70 % had multiple viruses. Several viruses are more commonly found in multiple virus detection whereas other viruses are similarly found in sole and in multiple virus detection.
