  A new molecular assay ( Viral CNS Flow Chip kit , Master Diagn√≥stica , Spain) has been developed for the detection of eight viruses causing acute<disease> meningitis<disease> and encephalitis<disease> , i.e. herpes<disease> simplex<disease> viruses 1-2 , varicella zoster<disease> virus , human<pathogen> enterovirus<pathogen> , human parechovirus , Toscana virus , human cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus. The new assay is a multiplex one-step RT-PCR followed by automatic flow-through hybridization , colorimetric detection and image analysis. The limit of detection was 50 copies/reaction , and 10 copies/reaction for human<pathogen> enterovirus<pathogen> and the other seven viruses , respectively. The analytical validation was performed with nucleic acids extracted from 268 cerebrospinal fluid samples and the results were compared with routine molecular assays. An excellent coefficient of agreement was observed between V-CNS and routine assays ( kappa index: 0.948 ( 95 % CI: 0.928-0.968)). The overall sensitivity and specificity was 95.9 % ( 95 % CI: 91.2-98.3 %) and 99.9 % ( 95 % CI: 99.6-100 %) , respectively. Viral CNS Flow Chip kit is an efficient multiplex platform for the detection of the main viruses involved in acute<disease> meningitis<disease> and encephalitis<disease>. The inclusion of a TOSV genome target may improve the laboratory diagnosis of viral neurological infections in endemic areas.
