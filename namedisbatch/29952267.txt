  Hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV) infection remains a global health problem. As `` cure '' for chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> is of current priority , hepatitis<disease> B<disease> immunoglobulin ( HBIG) has been utilized for several decades to provide post-exposure prophylaxis. In recent years , a number of monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs) targeting HBV have been developed and demonstrated with high affinity , specificity , and neutralizing potency. HBV neutralizing antibodies may play potentially significant role in the search for an HBV cure. In this review , we will summarize the recently progress in developing HBV-neutralizing antibodies , describe their characteristics and potential clinical applications. HBV neutralizing antibodies could be a promising alternative in the prevention and treatment of HBV infection. More importantly , global collaboration and coordinated approaches are thus needed to facilitate the development of novel therapies for HBV<pathogen> infection.
