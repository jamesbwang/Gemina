  Rocio virus ( ROCV) was the causative agent of an unprecedented outbreak of encephalitis<disease> during the 1970s in the Vale do Ribeira , Sao Paulo State , in the Southeast region of Brazil. Surprisingly , no further cases of ROCV infection were identified after this outbreak; however , serological surveys have suggested the circulation of ROCV among humans and animals in different regions of Brazil. Cross-protective immunity among flaviviruses is well documented; consequently , immunity induced by infections with other flaviviruses endemic to Brazil could potentially be responsible for the lack of ROCV infections. Herein , we evaluated the cross-protection mediated by other flaviviruses against ROCV infection using an experimental C57BL/6 mouse model. Cross-protection against ROCV infection was observed when animals had prior exposure to Ilheus<pathogen> virus<pathogen> or Saint Louis<disease> encephalitis<disease> virus<pathogen> , suggesting that cross-reactive anti-flavivirus antibodies may limit ROCV disease outbreaks.
