  Middle<pathogen> East<pathogen> Respiratory<disease> Syndrome<disease> Coronavirus<pathogen> ( MERS-CoV) is an evolving global health crisis. Despite recent efforts , there are numerous notable gaps in the understanding of MERS-CoV seasonal diversity. We aimed at investigating the global seasonal occurrence of Middle<pathogen> East<pathogen> Respiratory<disease> Syndrome<disease> coronavirus<pathogen> ( MERS-CoV) outbreaks. We obtained the data on the prevalence and occurrence of Middle<pathogen> East<pathogen> Respiratory<disease> Syndrome<disease> Coronavirus<pathogen> ( MERS-CoV) infection from the World Health Organization ( WHO) for all the MERS<pathogen> cases reported from the various countries and their allied ministries. We also recorded the research documents published in various global scientific journals on the seasonal occurrence of MERS-CoV infection during the period 2012-2017. Worldwide 2048 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported from June 2012 to the Dec 2017. 1680 ( 82.03 %) cases were from the Saudi Arabia and 368 ( 17.96 %) cases were reported from the other countries of the world. The maximum number of cases reported in June was 474 ( 23.14 %). 287 ( 14.01 %) cases were reported from Saudi Arabia and remaining 187 ( 9.13 %) cases were reported from all over the world. The number of cases reported from April to June was 396 ( 19.33 %) while the cases encountered from October to December were 231 ( 11.27 %). The highest global seasonal occurrence of Middle<pathogen> East<pathogen> Respiratory<disease> Syndrome<disease> coronavirus-MERS-CoV outbreak cases were found in the month of June , while the lowest was found in the month of January during the period of 2012 to 2017. The pattern of MERS-CoV infections has been observed to have seasonal variations. It is suggested that the health officials should highlight the seasonal occurrence of MERS-CoV outbreak and take better preventive measures to minimize the disease burden nationally and globally.
