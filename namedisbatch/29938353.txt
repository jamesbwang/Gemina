  Doxycycline is an antibiotic that , in addition to the classic antibacterial use , is also prescribed to fight parasitic<disease> diseases<disease> , like heartworm disease in dogs. Despite the concern that the overuse of this antibiotic may decrease susceptibility of clinically important bacteria , the consequences of the prolonged doxycycline therapy in heartworm-infected dogs have never been studied before. We have analyzed the impact of this therapy on Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and Enterococcus<pathogen> antimicrobial resistance. In this study , 17 heartworm-infected dogs ( 10 that had completed the doxycycline treatment and 7 dogs that had not yet begun) were included. Twenty-four isolates of Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> were obtained from two locations of each dog. After treatment , 73.3 % of isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic but only 22.2 % of isolates before treatment. Most of doxycycline resistant isolates were obtained from dogs that have received treatment. Erythromycin resistance or intermediate susceptibility was detected in 45.6 % of isolates , most of them from dogs after treatment. For Enterococci , 48 isolates were obtained from fecal samples ( 25 before treatment and 23 after treatment). Before treatment , 32 % of isolates were resistant at least to one antibiotic while after , this data increase up to 65 %. Comparing isolates before and after treatment , a clear increase in resistance to doxycycline ( 12 % against 21.74 %) and erythromycin ( 20 % against 39.13 %) was observed. Although the present work is a preliminary research , the results encourages the development of further studies to determinate the effect of prolonged doxycycline therapy on antimicrobial resistance.
