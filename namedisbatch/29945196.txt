  Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> is an opportunistic pathogen associated with nosocomial infections and disease complications. In the lungs of cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF) individuals , biofilm growth plays a crucial role in the persistence and antibiotic resistance of P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen>. Some strains , adapted to the CF lung microenvironment , show distinguishable phenotypes linked to biofilm production when compared to other strains. Using a novel image analysis quantification approach with crystal violet-stained biofilms , we compared the biofilm formation of four different P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> isolates in 24-well plates: PAO1 , the reference strain , LESB58 from CF patients ' lungs and PPF-1 and Urg-7 , two environmental isolates from dental unit waterlines. We also observed the formation of biofilm-like structures ( BLSs) floating in the medium and investigated growth inhibition of the attached biofilm and BLS with Mg2 + or Zn2 +. Urg-7 produced the most attached biofilms , but not the most BLSs. Attached biofilms had different responses to cations than BLSs did , but the effect of the cations was similar for all strains. These results demonstrate some diversity of biofilm formation in P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> and indicate that chemical inhibition of attached biofilm formation for a specific strain or isolate can not be predicative of a result on other P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> strains or on BLSs.
