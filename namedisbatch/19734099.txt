  Tuberculosis<disease> is the deadliest infectious<disease> disease<disease> worldwide. Although the BCG vaccine is widely used , it does not efficiently protect against pulmonary tuberculosis<disease> and an improved tuberculosis<disease> vaccine is therefore urgently needed. Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> uses different ESX/Type VII secretion ( T7S) systems to transport proteins important for virulence and host immune responses. We recently reported that secretion of T7S substrates belonging to the mycobacteria-specific Pro-Glu ( PE) and Pro-Pro-Glu ( PPE) proteins of the PGRS ( polymorphic GC-rich sequences) and MPTR ( major polymorphic tandem repeat) subfamilies required both a functional ESX-5 system and a functional PPE38/71 protein for secretion. Inactivation of ppe38/71 and the resulting loss of PE_PGRS/ PPE-MPTR secretion were linked to increased virulence of M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> strains. Here , we show that a predicted total of 89 PE_PGRS/ PPE-MPTR surface proteins are not exported by certain animal-adapted strains of the M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> complex including M.<pathogen> bovis<pathogen>. This Î”ppe38/71-associated secretion defect therefore also occurs in the M. bovis-derived tuberculosis<disease> vaccine BCG and could be partially restored by introduction of the M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> ppe38-locus. Epitope mapping of the PPE-MPTR protein PPE10 , further allowed us to monitor T-cell responses in splenocytes from BCG/M. tuberculosis<disease> immunized mice , confirming the dependence of PPE10-specific immune-induction on ESX-5/ PPE38-mediated secretion. Restoration of PE_PGRS/ PPE-MPTR secretion in recombinant BCG neither altered global antigenic presentation or activation of innate immune cells , nor protective efficacy in two different mouse vaccination-infection models. This unexpected finding stimulates a reassessment of the immunomodulatory properties of PE_PGRS/ PPE-MPTR proteins , some of which are contained in vaccine formulations currently in clinical evaluation.
