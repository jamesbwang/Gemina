  Selecting appropriate tools providing reliable quantitative measures of individual populations in biofilms is critical as we now recognize their true polymicrobial and heterogeneous nature. Here , plate count , quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( q-PCR) and peptide nucleic acid probe-fluorescence in situ hybridization ( PNA-FISH) were employed to quantitate cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> multispecies biofilms. Growth of Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> , Inquilinus<pathogen> limosus<pathogen> and Dolosigranulum<pathogen> pigrum<pathogen> was assessed in dual- and triple-species consortia under oxygen and antibiotic stress. Quantification methods , that were previously optimized and validated in planktonic consortia , were not always in agreement when applied in multispecies biofilms. Discrepancies in culture and molecular outcomes were observed , particularly for triple-species consortia and antibiotic-stressed biofilms. Some differences were observed , such as the higher bacterial counts obtained by q-PCR and/or PNA-FISH ( â‰¤ 4 log
