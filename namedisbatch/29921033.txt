  Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) vertical transmission may lead to microcephaly and other congenital anomalies. In March and April 2016 , the first outbreak of ZIKV occurred in Argentina. The objective was to describe the surveillance of newborns with microcephaly and other selected brain anomalies in Argentina , and evaluation different etiologies. Participants were enrolled between April 2016 and March 2017. newborns from the National Network of Congenital Abnormalities of Argentina ( RENAC) with head circumference lower than the 3rd percentile according to gestational age and sex , or selected brain anomalies. Blood and urine samples from cases and their mothers were tested for ZIKV by real-time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) , antigen-specific Immunoglobulin M ( MAC-ELISA) and plaque-reduction neutralization test ( PRNT A total of 104 cases were reported , with a prevalence of 6.9 per 10,000 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 5.7-8.4) , a significant increase when compared with the data prior to 2016 , Prevalence Rate Ratio 1.7 ( 95 % CI 1.2-2.3). In five cases positive serology for ZIKV ( IgM and IgG by PRNT) was detected. The five cases presented microcephaly with craniofacial disproportion. We detected four cases of CMV infection , three cases of congenital toxoplasmosis<disease> , two cases of herpes<disease> simplex<disease> infection , and one case of congenital syphilis<disease> The prevalence of microcephaly was significantly higher when compared with the previous period. The system had the capacity to detect five cases with congenital ZIKV syndrome<disease> in a country with limited viral circulation.
