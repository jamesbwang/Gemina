  HBV and HDV are major public health problems with millions affected globally and Pakistan accounts for a significant proportion of the global Hepatitis<disease> burden. This cross sectional study was designed to assess the general epidemiological and virological features of HBV and HDV<pathogen> in the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhawa ( KP) provinces of Pakistan. A total of 1890 HBV<pathogen> patients from March 2016 to May 2017 were recruited in the study and the presence of HDV<pathogen> was retrospectively evaluated in all participants. Most participants were young adults ( from 21 to 30 years). Genotyping was based on PCR amplification using primers specific for HBV<pathogen> genotypes A-F , and HDV<pathogen>. 405 nucleotide fragments of HDV<pathogen> were sequenced. MEGA was used for phylogenetic analysis. Overall prevalence of HBV was 14.08 % ( 266/1890). Higher prevalence was observed in males ( 66.85 %) as compared to females ( 33.15 %). Co-infection of HDV<pathogen> was found in 39 ( 14.66 %) patients. HBV<pathogen> genotype-D was prevalent in dual infections followed by HDV/A ( p < 0.05). While HDV<pathogen> genotype 1 was predominant in all HBV<pathogen> positive samples. Compared to Punjab , coinfection was higher in KP ( 14.3 % versus15 .2 %; p < 0.05). The prevalence of HBV and HDV<pathogen> is high in Pakistan. The description of HBV and HDV<pathogen> genotypes circulating in East and North-West Pakistan can contribute to a better understanding of their relevance in regional epidemics. These infections are highly endemic in the KP , where their control is confounded by its vast territorial dimension with small , hard-to-reach municipalities and diverse ethnic populations.
