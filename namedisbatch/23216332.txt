  Hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) is an enveloped DNA virus belongs to Hepadnaviridea family. HBV infection is a serious global health problem , with 2 billion people infected worldwide , and 350 million suffering from chronic HBV infection. The aim of this study was to determine the serological pattern and molecular characterization of HBV diversity in asymptomatic blood donors in Iran alongside with the mutation status of HBV in relation to blood safety. One hundred and sixty six samples from asymptomatic blood donors who were positive for hepatitis<disease> B<disease> surface antigen during 2012 to 2014 were selected. The serological and molecular markers were analyzed by screening HBsAb , HBcAb , HBeAg and HBeAb and HBV-DNA. For detection of HBV genotypes and possible mutations , HBV polymerase and pre core/core regions were sequenced. In term of serologic markers of HBV , 100 % of asymptomatic blood donors were HBsAg positive and 97.6 % , 92.2 % , 5.4 % and 2.4 % of them were HBcAb , HBeAb , HBeAg and HBsAb positive respectively in asymptomatic blood donors. The maximum of samples viral load was 4.41 Ã— 10 This study showed that from 166 samples most of them were in a chronic phase of HBV infection and just 5.4 % of asymptomatic blood donors were in the acute phase or acute chronic phase of HBV infection. The major risk factor for HBV<pathogen> infection was a familial history of HBV.
