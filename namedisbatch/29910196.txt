  In this pilot study , volatile molecules produced by cultures of Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> were evaluated to determine whether they could be used to discriminate between uninfected and M. tuberculosis-infected macaques. Thirty seven of the culture biomarkers were detectable in macaque breath and were shown to discriminate between uninfected and infected animals with an area under the curve ( AUC) of 87 %. An AUC of 98 % was achieved when using the top 38 discriminatory molecules detectable in breath. We report two newly discovered volatile biomarkers , not previously associated with M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> , that were selected in both our in vitro and in vivo discriminatory biomarker suites: 4- ( 1,1-dimethylpropyl) phenol and 4-ethyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethylheptane. Additionally , we report the detection of heptanal , a previously-identified M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> breath biomarker in humans , as an in vitro culture biomarker that was detected in every macaque breath sample analyzed , though not part of the in vivo discriminatory suite. This study suggests that molecules from the headspace of M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> culture show potential to translate as breath biomarkers for macaques infected with the same strain.
