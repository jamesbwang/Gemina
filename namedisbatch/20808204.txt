  People with HIV<pathogen> infection with latent tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) infection ( LTBI) are at a 10-fold greater risk of developing active disease. Interferon gamma release assays and tuberculin skin testing have approximately 65 % to 70 % specificity for diagnosing LTBI in HIV-infected patients. LTBI can be successfully treated with isoniazid preventive therapy and early antiretroviral therapy ( ART). Rapid molecular diagnostics have approximately 88 % sensitivity and 98 % specificity for identifying active TB. ART should be started early in patients with TB. A number of ART regimens are recommended in co-treatment that minimize the risk of drug-drug interactions. Although progress has been made , better diagnostics and TB regimens with lower risks of drug-drug interactions and shorter treatment durations are still needed.
