  The purpose of this article is to provide an update on recent developments in fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT) in the last year. Although FMT is an accepted treatment for recurrent Clostridium<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> infection ( CDI) , recently it is also gaining acceptance for the treatment of refractory CDI. FMT is showing promise in ulcerative colitis<disease> and is experimental in many other conditions. The optimal practical aspects to enhance the success of FMT are still being established. The implication of current research is that the indications of FMT may be extended to other conditions in the future.
