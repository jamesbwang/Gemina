  Lipases are an economic important group of biocatalysts that can be produced by some fungal under solid-state fermentation. Orange wastes are source of lipases and potential substrates for lipases production. This work assessed 19 fugal strains cultivated in Citrus sinensis<pathogen> cv. Hamlin orange wastes ( peel , frit and core) for production of lipases in order to generate compounds with antioxidant , antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties. Fifteen of those fungi<pathogen> grew and produced lipases , mainly the Aspergillus<pathogen> brasiliensis<pathogen> ( National Institute of Quality Control ( INCQS) 40036)/ frit system , which showed 99.58 U/g total lipase. The substrate with the highest production of lipase was frit with 26.67 and 78.91 U/g of total lipases produced on average by the 15 microorganisms. Aspergillus<pathogen> niger 01/frit ( 33.53 U/g) and Aspergillus<pathogen> niger ( INCQS 40015)/ frit ( 34.76 U/g) systems showed the highest specificity values in all the herein tested synthetic substrates with 4 , 12 and 16 carbons. Analysis of the fatty acid profile of hydrolysis products obtained in the most prominent systems applied to corn and sunflower oils showed: palmitic acid , linoleic acid , oleic acid , and stearic acid. These acids showed antioxidant capacity of up to 58 % DPPH ( 2,2-diphenyl-1-pierylhydrazyl) radical reduction and antibacterial activity against Escherichia<pathogen> coli , Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> , Pseudomonas<pathogen> aureginosa , Salmonella<disease> Enteritidis<pathogen> and Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , as well as cytotoxicity to SCC9 cells ( squamous cancer cells).
