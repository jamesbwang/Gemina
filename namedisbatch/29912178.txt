  The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is one of the best developed model systems of infection and innate immunity. While most work has focused on systemic<disease> infections<disease> , there has been a recent increase of interest in the mechanisms of gut immunocompetence to pathogens , which require methods to orally infect flies. Here we present a protocol to orally expose individual flies to an opportunistic bacterial pathogen ( Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> and a natural bacterial pathogen of D. melanogaster ( Pseudomonas<pathogen> entomophila). The goal of this protocol is to provide a robust method to expose male and female flies to these pathogens. We provide representative results showing survival phenotypes , microbe loads , and bacterial shedding , which is relevant for the study of heterogeneity in pathogen transmission. Finally , we confirm that Dcy mutants ( lacking the protective peritrophic matrix in the gut epithelium) and Relish mutants ( lacking a functional immune deficiency ( IMD) pathway) , show increased susceptibility to bacterial oral infection. This protocol , therefore , describes a robust method to infect flies using the oral route of infection , which can be extended to the study of a variety genetic and environmental sources of variation in gut infection outcomes and bacterial transmission.
