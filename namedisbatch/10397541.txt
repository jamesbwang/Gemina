  Adherence to antiretroviral therapy ( ART) is paramount to successful long-term suppression of human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>). For poorly adherent patients with HIV<pathogen> , barriers to remaining adherent may be overcome by the implementation of targeted interventions delivered via mobile devices. This systematic review is focused specifically on mobile phone technologies to deliver adherence interventions in HIV/acquired immunodeficiency<disease> syndrome<disease> ( AIDS) populations. This review ( PROSPERO #CRD42017065131) systematically extracted data from published literature from five databases on mobile phone interventions to improve adherence to ART for HIV<pathogen>. The reported studies had been conducted between 2007 and 2017. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane method ranking each criterion as low , high , or unclear risk of bias. Of the 835 articles returned , we identified 26 randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) , retrospective and prospective cohort trials , or mixed method studies with a comparison group that fit criteria for inclusion. No standard measure of adherence was consistent throughout the examined studies , and assessments by self-report , pill counting , and medication event monitoring system ( MEMS) were utilized. The studies reported mixed results , with 17 reporting significant improvements to adherence , 3 reporting improvements without supplying The mixed nature of the results exemplifies the need for more comprehensive approaches and larger scale trials to confirm results observed in limited cohort sizes. To better retain satisfactory adherence within the HIV<pathogen> population , and especially in low-resource settings , we recommend that future interventions incorporate multiple strategies: mobile-based reminders , social support structures , and personalized content.
