  Four new species , Troglodytella gracilis<pathogen> , T. virunga , T. dolium , and Gorilloflasca longior were described from the mountain<disease> gorillas in Rwanda. The three Troglodytella species share a retractable adoral ciliary zone , four non-retractable ciliary arches , two broad skeletal plates , a skeletal rod plate , numerous longitudinal cortical grooves , and four contractile vacuoles. The anterior ciliary arch is the longest of the four arches , extending transversely on the left body surface. T. gracilis<pathogen> and T. virunga are characterized by an elongated body , a tail flap , and a wedge-shaped macronucleus. T. virunga can be distinguished from T. gracilis<pathogen> by a trifurcate dorsal lobe , three right lobes , and two ventral spines. T. dolium has a barrel-shaped body and a rod-shaped or boomerang-shaped macronucleus. The buccal infraciliature of the three Troglodytella is composed of an adoral polybrachykinety , a perivestibular polybrachykinety , and paralabial kineties. G. longior has a long flask-shaped body , a vestibulum , a frontal lobe , a posterior cavity , an ellipsoidal or peanut-shaped macronucleus , a contractile vacuole , non-retractable adoral and vestibular ciliary zones in buccal area , a cavity ciliary zone , and two longitudinal dorsal ciliary zones. The infraciliature of G. longior is the same as that of G. africana.
