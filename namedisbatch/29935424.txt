  Human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) , notably type 16 , is a risk factor for up to 75 % of oropharyngeal<disease> squamous cell carcinomas ( SCC). It has been demonstrated that small non-coding RNAs known as microRNAs play a vital role in the cellular transformation process. In this study , we used an LNA array to further investigate the impact of HPV16 on the expression of microRNAs in oropharyngeal<disease> ( tonsillar) cancer. A number of miRNAs were found to be deregulated , with miR-496 showing a four-fold decrease. Over-expression of the high risk E6 oncoprotein down-regulated miR-496 , impacting upon the post-transcriptional control of the transcription factor E2F2. These HPV<pathogen> specific miRNAs were integrated with the HPV16 interactome to identify possible mechanistic pathways. These analyses provide insights into novel molecular interactions between HPV16 and miRNAs in oropharyngeal<disease> cancers.
