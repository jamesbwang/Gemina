  The 2014-2016 Ebola<disease> virus ( EBOV<pathogen>) disease outbreak affected over 29000 people and left behind the biggest cohort ( over 17000 individuals) of Ebola<disease> survivors in history. Although the persistence of EBOV<pathogen> in body fluids of survivors was reported before the recent outbreak , new evidence revealed that the virus can be detected up to 18 months in the semen , which represents the biggest risk of Ebola<disease> resurgence in affected communities. In this study , we review the knowledge on the Ebola<disease> flare-ups that occurred after the peak of the 2014-2016 Ebola<disease> epidemic in West Africa.
