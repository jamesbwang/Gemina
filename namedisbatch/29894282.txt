  The aim of this study was to characterize the fluoroquinolone ( FQ) resistance mechanism of Salmonella<disease> enterica<pathogen> serovar<pathogen> Typhi<disease> and Paratyphi<pathogen> A<pathogen> in Bangladesh. Salmonella<disease> Typhi<disease> isolates were classified into sequence type ( ST) 1 , ST2 , and ST2209 and Salmonella<disease> Paratyphi<pathogen> A isolates were classified into ST85 and ST129. The most common STs of the FQ-nonsusceptible strain were ST1 ( 44.4 %) and ST129 ( 66.6 %). Thirty-nine percent of Salmonella<pathogen> Typhi isolates were multidrug resistant , and these were all ST1 , which is the type prevalent in the Indian subcontinent. Although plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes were not detected in any of the tested strains , single and double mutations were identified in the quinolone resistance-determining region ( QRDR). The most common QRDR mutation was GyrA_Ser83Phe ( 66.7 % for Salmonella<pathogen> Typhi and 100 % for Salmonella<disease> Paratyphi<pathogen> A<pathogen>). Treatment with an efflux pump inhibitor resulted in susceptibility of the strains to levofloxacin. All isolates demonstrated 100 % susceptibility to ceftriaxone , azithromycin , and carbapenem. Our results suggest that mutations in gyrase A and enhancement of efflux pump activity are responsible for the resistance to FQs; in particular , the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump may be an important resistance factor for levofloxacin. To control the spread of FQ-nonsusceptible Salmonella<disease> Typhi<disease> , intensive surveillance in endemic areas , including Bangladesh , and effective infection control are necessary.
