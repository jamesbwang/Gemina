  Prognostic impact of p16 expression in patients with oropharyngeal<disease> squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC) undergoing surgery is not fully examined. The aim of this study was to clarify these issues. Sixty-four OSCC subjects were analyzed. Immuno-histochemical staining of p16 , a surrogate marker for human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) , was performed histopathologically. Data were retrospectively analyzed according to p16 positivity and factors linked to prognosis were also analyzed. No significant difference was observed in the prognosis between the p16-positive group ( n = 28) and the p16-negative group ( n = 36). In patients undergoing post-operative radiation , the p16-positive group ( n = 18) had a significantly better prognosis than the p16-negative group ( n = 6). On multivariate analysis , transoral surgery was a significant predictor of overall survival ( p = 0.0173). Prognostic impact of p16 can be emphasized in a subgroup of OSCC patients undergoing surgery. Surgery with sufficient surgical margin may be chosen as the first treatment for HPV-negative OSCC in some cases.
