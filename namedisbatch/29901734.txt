  Wolbachia<pathogen> is a genus of endosymbiotic bacteria that infects 66 % of all insect species. Its major impact on insects is in reproduction: sterility , production of one sex , and/or parthenogenesis. Another effect was discovered when the disease-transmitting mosquito , Aedes<pathogen> aegypti Linnaeus ( Diptera: Culicidae) , was infected with Wolbachia isolated from Drosophila: infected female mosquitoes became less capable of transmitting diseases such as dengue<disease> fever<disease> and chikungunya<pathogen>. This has led to releases of Ae. aegypti carrying Wolbachia<pathogen> in an attempt to control disease. An open question is whether there are natural Wolbachia infections of this mosquito. We assayed DNA from 2,663 Ae. aegypti from 27 countries on six continents , 230 from laboratory strains , and 72 Aedes<pathogen> mascarensis MacGregor ( Diptera: Culicidae) for presence of Wolbachia DNA. Within the limits of our polymerase chain reaction-based assay , we found no evidence of Wolbachia , suggesting that natural infections of this endosymbiont are unlikely to occur throughout the worldwide distribution of Ae. aegypti.
