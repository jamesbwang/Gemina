  This study aims at characterizing the diversity and temporal changes of species richness and composition of fungi<pathogen> in an ecotone of a forest<disease> border and a meadow in the Taunus mountain<disease> range in Germany. All macroscopically visible , epigeous fungi<pathogen> and vascular plants were sampled monthly over three years , together with climatic variables like humidity and temperature that influence fungal diversity and composition as shown by previous studies. In this mosaic landscape , a total of 855 fungal species were collected and identified based on morphological features , the majority of which belonged to
