  Ornithine<disease> transcarbamylases ( OTCs) are conserved enzymes involved in arginine biosynthesis in microbes and the urea cycle in mammals. Recent bioinformatics analyses identified two unique OTC variants , N-succinyl-l-ornithine transcarbamylase from Bacteroides<pathogen> fragilis<pathogen> ( BfSOTC) and N-acetyl-l-ornithine transcarbamylase from Xanthomonas<pathogen> campestris<pathogen> ( XcAOTC). These two variants diverged from other OTCs during evolution despite sharing the common tertiary and quaternary structures , with the exception that the substrate recognition motifs are topologically knotted. The OTC family therefore offers a unique opportunity for investigating the importance of protein knots in biological functions and folding stabilities. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange-coupled mass spectrometry , we compared the native dynamics of BfSOTC and XcAOTC with respect to the unknotted ornithine<disease> transcarbamylase from Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( EcOTC). Our results suggest that , in addition to substrate specificity , the knotted structures in XcAOTC and BfSOTC may play an important role in stabilizing the folding dynamics , particularly around the knotted structural elements.
