  Leptospirosis<disease> is an important global public health problem. Favourable environmental factors are influencing the survival of leptospires in soil , which is an important link in the transmission cycle. The present study was designed to understand the correlation between various soil nutrients and presence of Leptospira<pathogen> in soil samples of different regions of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The study revealed a significant positive relationship between presence of Leptospira<pathogen> and concentration of iron , manganese and copper in soil. Presence of iron , manganese and copper in the soil may influence the survival and transmission of
