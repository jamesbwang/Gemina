  Endophthalmitis<disease> is a serious complication of intraocular procedures: knowledge of its causative organisms and outcomes may guide prevention and treatment. To determine the outcomes and spectrum of causative organisms in acute post-procedural endophthalmitis<disease> A retrospective observational case series performed at a tertiary referral hospital during the period 1 July 2012 to 31 July 2017. Two hundred and forty-eight patients diagnosed with acute ( â‰¤ 6 weeks post-inciting event) endophthalmitis<disease> Chart review of microbiological and clinical data. The main outcome measure was odds of any improvement in visual acuity ( 3 months versus presentation). Secondary outcomes included causative organism , likelihood of vitrectomy and likelihood of evisceration. One hundred and ninty cases were post-cataract surgery or post-intravitreal injection ( 49 and 141 , respectively). Causative organisms were identified in 45 % of post-cataract surgery and 54 % of post-injection cases ( OR = 0.69; P = 0.61). Streptococcus<pathogen> epidermidis<pathogen> was the most frequent causative organism. Streptococcus<pathogen> species accounted for 32 % of post-surgical and 7 % of culture-positive post-injection cases ( OR = 6.63; P = 0.02). At 3 months , 81 % of post-surgical and 84 % of post-injection cases had improved BCVA over presentation ( OR 0.59; P = 0.61). S.<pathogen> epidermidis<pathogen> is the most common causative organism. In contrast to other studies , we did not find evidence for an increased odds of Streptococcus<pathogen> spp. endophthalmitis<disease> following intravitreal injection. This may in turn reflect guideline-driven changes in practice.
