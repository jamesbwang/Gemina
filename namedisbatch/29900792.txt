  Brazil has a large variety of wild animal species , but limited data are available on the occurrence of Brucella<pathogen> abortus<pathogen> and Leptospira<pathogen> spp. antibodies in these animals. Sera from 141 captive mammals belonging to 11 different species from the Northern and Northeastern regions of Brazil were screened. Antibodies against B.<pathogen> abortus<pathogen> and Leptospira<pathogen> spp. ( 24 live serovars) were investigated using the Rose Bengal plate and microscopic agglutination tests , respectively. Associations between the age , gender , and place of captivity were analyzed using the Pearson chi-square or the Fisher exact test. None of the animals were antibody positive for B.<pathogen> abortus<pathogen>. Among the animals tested , 11 ( 7.8 %) were seropositive for Leptospira<pathogen> spp.. These included one red brocket deer ( Mazama americana<pathogen>) , two tufted capuchin ( Sapajus apella) , seven agoutis ( Dasyprocta aguti) , and one lowland paca ( Cuniculus paca). No association was observed between sex , age , and the occurrence of Leptospira<pathogen> spp. antibodies ( P > 0.05). However , an association was observed according to the place of captivity ( P = 0.046). From these 11 positive animals , six ( 54.5 %) reacted to the serovars from the Icterohaemorraghiae serogroup<pathogen> , which is mainly responsible for the clinical cases of human leptospirosis<disease> in Brazil. To our knowledge , this is the first report of Leptospira<pathogen> spp. antibodies in M. americana<pathogen> and C. paca.
