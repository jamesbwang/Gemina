  The activation of the cell-mediated immune responses by Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> can promote atherogenesis. The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of latent tuberculosis<disease> infection ( LTBI) among patients with coronary artery stenosis ( CAS) and to explore the association between LTBI and development of CAS. We conducted a case-control study which included 183 patients ' who underwent percutaneous coronary angiography ( 121 patients with CAS and 62 patients without as a control group). For all the study population , clinical evaluation , tuberculin skin test ( TST) , imaging studies ( including chest radiography and echocardiography) , laboratory investigations , and electrocardiography were carried out. Only for the patients with positive TST , QuantiFERON-TB Gold test was performed. Predictors of CAS were identified using univariate analyses ( Yates ' corrected Chi-square test or Fischer 's exact test) followed by multivariate analysis ( binary logistic regression). Among 29.5 % of the study population , LTBI was detected , and among patients with CAS , 56.2 % of patients had advanced CAS. After multivariate analysis , it was found that metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MS) ( odds ratio ( OR) 3.6 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.5-22.6 , P = 0.022) and LTBI ( OR 2.5 , 95 % CI 1.2-17.3 , P = 0.018) were the predictors of CAS among the study population , while only diabetes mellitus ( DM) ( OR 1.9 , 95 % CI 1.1-11.7 , P = 0.031) was the predictor of advanced CAS. LTBI is associated with the development of CAS. In addition , MS is associated with CAS , while its related disorder , DM , is associated with advanced CAS.
