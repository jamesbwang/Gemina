  Murine cytomegalovirus ( MCMV) has been reported from house mice ( Mus<pathogen> musculus<pathogen> worldwide , but only recently from Eastern<disease> house mice ( M m. musculus<pathogen>) , of particular interest because they form a semi-permeable species barrier in Europe with Western house mice , M m. domesticus. Here we report genome sequences of EastMCMV ( from Eastern<disease> mice) , and set these in the context of MCMV genomes from genus Mus<pathogen> hosts. We show EastMCMV and WestMCMV are genetically distinct. Phylogeny splitting analyses show a genome wide ( 94 %) pattern consistent with no West-East introgression , the major exception ( 3.8 %) being a genome-terminal region of duplicated genes involved in host immune system evasion. As expected from its function , this is a region of maintenance of ancestral polymorphism: The lack of clear splitting signal can not be interpreted as evidence of introgression. The EastMCMV genome sequences reported here can therefore serve as a well-described resource for exploration of murid MCMV diversity.
