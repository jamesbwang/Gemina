  We describe an extremely rare case of mediastinitis<disease> superinfected by emerging Achromobacter<pathogen> xylosoxidans<pathogen> After mitral and aortic valves replacement , the patient first developed a Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> mediastinitis<disease> , and five days after starting adapted antibiotic therapy , superficial pus analysis revealed the presence of Achromobacter<pathogen> xylosoxidans<pathogen> This superinfection was considered superficial and focus was made on Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> mediastinitis<disease>. Three weeks later , no more Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> was found in pus samples and the sepsis<disease> seemed under control. Unfortunately , blood cultures were again positive for Achromobacter<pathogen> xylosoxidans<pathogen> three weeks later and the patient died from septic
