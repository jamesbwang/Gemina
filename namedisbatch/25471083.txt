  Malaria<disease> is a major infectious<disease> disease<disease> in the world. In 2015 , approximately 212 million people were infected and 429,000 people were killed by this disease. Plasmodium<pathogen> falciparum<pathogen> , which causes falciparum<disease> malaria<disease> , is becoming resistant to artemisinin ( ART) in Southeast Asia; therefore , new anti-malarial drugs are urgently needed. Some excellent anti-malarial drugs , such as quinine or ART , were originally obtained from natural plants. Hence , the authors screened a natural product library comprising traditional Chinese medicines ( TCMs) to identify compounds/extracts with anti-malarial effects. The authors performed three assays: a malaria<disease> growth inhibition assay ( GIA) , a cytotoxicity assay , and a malaria<disease> stage-specific GIA. The malaria<disease> GIA revealed the anti-malarial ability and half-maximal inhibitory concentrations ( IC Four natural compounds ( berberine chloride , coptisine chloride , palmatine chloride , and dehydrocorydaline nitrate) showed strong anti-malarial effects ( IC The authors identified four compounds ( berberine chloride , coptisine chloride , palmatine chloride , and dehydrocorydaline nitrate) and two extracts ( Phellodendri cortex and Coptidis rhizoma) with anti-malarial activity , neither of which had previously been described.
