  The emergence of new avian influenza<disease> virus<pathogen> ( AIV) strains able to infect humans represents a serious threat to global human health. In addition to surveillance and vaccine development , antiviral therapy remains crucial for AIV control; however , the increase in drug-resistant AIV strains underscores the need for novel approaches to anti-influenza chemotherapy. We have previously shown that the thiazolide anti-infective nitazoxanide ( NTZ) inhibits influenza<disease> A/PuertoRico/8/ 1934 ( H1N1<pathogen>) virus<pathogen> replication , and this effect was associated with inhibition of viral hemagglutinin ( HA) maturation. Herein we investigated the activity of the second-generation thiazolide haloxanide ( HLN) against H5N9<pathogen> , H7N1<pathogen> and H1N1<pathogen> AIV infection in vitro , and explored the mechanism of the antiviral action. Using the A/chicken/Italy/ 9097/1997 ( H5N9<pathogen>) AIV as a model , we show that HLN and its precursor p-haloxanide are more effective than NTZ against AIV , with IC
