  GDSL-type esterase/lipase ( GELP) is mainly characterized by a conserved GDSL domain at N terminus , and is widely found in all living species , both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. GELP gene family consists of a wide range of members playing important roles in plant physiological processes , such as development , stress responses , and functional divergences. In our study , 597 GELP genes were identified from six Rosaceae genomes ( i.e. , Fragaria vesca , Prunus persica<pathogen> , Prunus avium<disease> , Prunus mume , Pyrus bretschneideri , and Malus domestica) by a comprehensive analysis. All GELP genes were further divided into ten subfamilies based on phylogenetic tree analysis. Subfamily D and subfamily E are the two largest subfamilies. Microcollinearity analysis suggested that WGD/segmental events contribute to the expansion of the GELP gene family in M. domestica and P. bretschneideri compared to F. vesca , P. persica<pathogen> , P. avium<disease> , and P. mume. Some PbGELPs were expressed during the fruit development of P. bretschneideri and pollen tubes , indicating their activity in these tissues. The expression divergence of PbGELP duplication gene pairs suggests that many mutations were allowed during evolution , although the structure of GELP genes was highly conserved. The current study results provided the feasibility to understand the expansion and evolution patterns of GELP in Rosaceae genomes , and highlight the function during P. bretschneideri fruits and pollen tubes development.
