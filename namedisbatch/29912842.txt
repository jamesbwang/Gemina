  Mycoplasma<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia<disease> and may cause life-threatening disease in children. We identified 30 ( 0.3 %) confirmed M.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> cases by clinical and laboratory criteria in 11,526 PICU admissions. Outcomes were comparable to patients admitted with other infections ( n = 3,005 , p > 0.1). Our findings indicate that empiric antimicrobial coverage for M.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> infection in PICU is rarely needed.
