  We found earlier that ectopic expression of the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G ( A3G) in Vero cells inhibits measles<pathogen> ( MV<pathogen>) , respiratory<disease> syncytial<disease> and mumps<pathogen> virus<pathogen> , while the mechanism of inhibition remained unclear. A microarray analysis revealed that in A3G transduced Vero cells several cellular transcripts were differentially expressed suggesting that A3G regulates the expression of host factors. One of the best up-regulated host cell factors , REDD1 ( regulated in development and DNA damage response-1 , also called DDIT4) , reduced MV<pathogen> replication âˆ¼ 10 fold upon over-expression in Vero cells. REDD1 is an endogenous inhibitor of mTORC1 ( mammalian target of rapamycin complex-1) , the central regulator of cellular metabolism. Interestingly , rapamycin reduced the MV<pathogen> replication similarly as REDD1 over-expression , while the combination of both did not lead to further inhibition suggesting that the same pathway is affected. REDD1 silencing in A3G expressing Vero cells abolished the inhibitory effect of A3G. In addition , silencing of A3G led to reduced REDD1 expression confirming that its expression is regulated by A3G. In primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL) , A3G and REDD1 expression were found to be stimulated by PHA ( phytohemagglutinin) and interleukin-2. SiRNA mediated depletion of A3G in PHA-stimulated PBL reduced REDD1 expression and increased viral titers , which corroborates our findings in Vero cells. Silencing of REDD1 also increased viral titers confirming the antiviral role of REDD1. Finally , pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin in PHA-stimulated PBL reduced viral replication to a level as found in unstimulated lymphocytes , indicating that mTORC1 activity supports MV<pathogen> replication as proviral host factor.
