  Following extirpation from Ontario , Canada , in the early 1900s , Eastern<disease> Wild Turkeys ( EWTs; Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) were successfully reintroduced to the province in 1984. Despite the subsequent establishment of robust populations and biannual hunting seasons , data on the circulation of potential pathogens in these birds are lacking. Similarly , the interface between EWTs and poultry is poorly understood and includes possible bidirectional pathogen transmission via direct or indirect contact. Mycoplasma<pathogen> and Eimeria spp. are potential pathogens in Galliformes , and our objective was to determine their prevalence and distribution in Ontario EWTs. During the 2015 spring hunting season ( April and May) , oropharyngeal<disease> swabs from 147 hunter-harvested and five opportunistically collected EWTs from southern Ontario were cultured for Mycoplasma<pathogen> spp.. The intestinal or cloacal contents of 107 of these birds and an additional 24 opportunistically and biologist-collected EWTs were analyzed for Eimeria spp. using PCR or fecal flotation. At least one Mycoplasma<pathogen> spp. was isolated from 98.7 % ( 150/152) of EWTs , with six species identified. Mycoplasma<pathogen> gallopavonis was identified most commonly in 96.7 % ( 147/152) , followed by Mycoplasma<pathogen> gallinaceum in 23.7 % ( 36/152). Potential poultry pathogens ( Mycoplasma<pathogen> meleagridis , Mycoplasma<pathogen> iowae , and Mycoplasma<pathogen> synoviae) were isolated from swabs of five ( 3.3 %) EWTs. Coinfections with up to three Mycoplasma<pathogen> spp. were detected in 36.8 % ( 56/152) of EWTs. Most EWTs tested positive for Eimeria spp. oocysts ( 75.6 %; 99/131). A subset of positive samples ( n = 16) were characterized by PCR , which detected the following species: Eimeria meleagrimitis ( 93.8 %) , Eimeria adenoeides ( 93.8 %) , Eimeria gallopavonis ( 56.3 %) , and Eimeria meleagridis ( 12.5 %). The majority ( 93.8 %) of these samples were positive for more than one Eimeria spp.. We showed that numerous , mostly nonpathogenic Mycoplasma<pathogen> and Eimeria spp. circulate in EWTs across southern Ontario , and this helped to establish baseline information for comparison with future surveillance and monitoring.
