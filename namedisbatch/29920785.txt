  To identify the epidemiology and antifungal susceptibilities of Candida spp. among blood culture isolates to identify the epidemiology and antifungal susceptibilities of Candida spp. among blood culture isolates in Sweden. The study was a retrospective , observational nationwide laboratory-based surveillance for fungaemia and fungal meningitis<disease> and was conducted from September 2015 to August 2016. In total , 488 Candida blood culture isolates were obtained from 471 patients ( 58 % males). Compared to our previous study , the incidence of candidaemia has increased from 4.2/ 100 000 ( 2005-2006) to 4.7/ 100 000 population/year ( 2015-2016). The three most common Candida<pathogen> spp. isolated from blood cultures were Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> ( 54.7 %) , Candida<pathogen> glabrata<pathogen> ( 19.7 %) and species in the Candida<pathogen> parapsilosis<pathogen> complex ( 9.4 %). Candida resistance to fluconazole was 2 % in C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> and between 0 % and 100 % , in non-albicans species other than C.<pathogen> glabrata<pathogen> and C. krusei. Resistance to voriconazole was rare , except for C.<pathogen> glabrata<pathogen> , C. krusei and C.<pathogen> tropicalis<pathogen>. Resistance to anidulafungin was 3.8 % while no Candida<pathogen> isolate was resistant to amphotericin B. We report an overall increase in candidaemia but a minor decrease of C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> while C.<pathogen> glabrata<pathogen> and C.<pathogen> parapsilosis<pathogen> remain constant over this 10-year period.
