  Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> as an intracellular pathogen causes tuberculosis<disease> ( TB). Due to the long time required for treatment , hepatotoxicity of drugs and also emergence of multidrug-resistant ( MDR) and extremely drug resistant ( XDR) strains , TB is currently a major public health problem. Some medicinal plants possess remarkable activity against Mycobacterium<disease>. Among them , Lamiaceae family are of pharmaceutical interest because of their potential antimicrobial properties. The aim of the study was to evaluate the in vitro activities of Satureja rechingeri , Satureja khuzestanica and Zataria multiflora against MDR M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> and two non-tuberculous mycobacteria ( NTM). The recent patents on plant compositions ( US7641919 B2 , US7887860 B2 , US 8865231 B2 , US 9345659 B2 , WO 2014158797 A1 and WO 2014158877 A1) helped in selecting the anti-mycobacterial drugs. The essential oils were prepared by the standard method. The confirmed strains were obtained from the microbial collection of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Minimum inhibitory concentrations ( MICs) of essential oils of plants against mycobacterial strains were determined using standard broth microdilution method. MDR M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> was completely inhibited by Z. multiflora at 78μg/ml concentration. S. rechingeri and S. khuzestanica also showed same anti-mycobacterial activity against MDR M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> with MICs of 156 μg/ml. The MICs of the essential oils against M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> H37Rv<pathogen> , M.<pathogen> kansasii<pathogen> and M.<pathogen> fortuitum<pathogen> were in the range from 39 to 156 μg/ml. The studied medicinal plants showed notable effects against mycobacterial strains. Our results indicated that utilization of Lamiaceae family can be helpful for treatment of mycobacterial infections.
