  During pregnancy fetus can be exposed to a variety of chemicals which may induce abortion<disease> and malformations. Due to the amounts of new substances coming into the market every year , a high demand for a rapid , reliable , and cost-effective method to detect potential toxicity is necessary. Different species have been used as animal models for teratogen screening , most of them sharing similar development processes with humans. However , the application of embryology knowledge to teratology is hampered by the complexity of the reproduction processes.The present chapter outlines the essential development periods in different models , and highlights the similarities and differences between species , advantages and disadvantages of each group , and specific sensitivities for teratogenic tests. These models can be organized into the following categories: ( 1) invertebrate species such Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> and Drosophila melanogaster , which have become ideal for screening simple mechanisms in the early periods of reproductive cycle , allowing for rapid results and minor ethical concerns; ( 2) vertebrate nonmammalian species such Xenopus laevis and Danio<pathogen> rerio<pathogen> , important models to assess teratogenic potential in later development with fewer ethical requirements; and ( 3) the mammalian species Mus<pathogen> musculus<pathogen> , Rattus<pathogen> norvegicus<pathogen> , and Oryctolagus cuniculus , phylogenetically more close to humans , essential to assess complex specialized processes , that occur later in development.Rules for development toxicology tests require the use of mammalian species. However , ethical concerns and costs limit their use in large-scale screening. By contrast , invertebrate and vertebrate nonmammalian species are increasing as alternative animal models , as these organisms combine less ethical requirements , low costs and culture conditions compatible with large-scale screening. In contrast to the in vitro techniques , their main advantage is to allow for high-throughput screening in a whole-animal context , not dependent on the prior identification of a target. In this chapter , the biological development of the animals most used in teratogenic tests is adressed with the aims of maximizing human translation , reducing the number of animals used , and the time to market for new drugs.
