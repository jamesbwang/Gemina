  The aim study was to explore the distribution of Salmonella<disease> Enteritidis<pathogen> ( S.<pathogen> enteritidis<pathogen>) in internal organs and variation of cecum microbiota in newly hatched chicken after oral challenge during a 21-day period. The quantities of S enteritidis DNA in different internal organs ( heart , liver , spleen , stomach , pancreas , small intestine , blood and cecum contents) were determined by real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( FQ-PCR). The result showed that all of the above-mentioned samples were positive at 12 h post inoculation ( PI) after oral challenge. The highest copy numbers of S.<pathogen> enteritidis<pathogen> in all tissue were heart and liver , with about 2 Ã— 10
