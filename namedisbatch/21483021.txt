  To investigate the prevalence of chronic comorbidities and the use of comedications in people living with HIV<pathogen> ( PLWH) and on antiretrovirals in Japan , by using a hospital claims database. Observational , retrospective , cross-sectional study. A hospital claims database of Japanese hospitals that have advanced medical treatment capabilities ( ie , advanced treatment hospitals , general hospitals , acute care hospitals) , which include those providing acute and chronic care ( excluding nursing homes or hospices). A total of 1445 PLWH aged â‰¥ 18 years and with a prescription record of antiretrovirals between January 2010 and December 2015 were identified from the database. The number and types of chronic comorbidities , as well as the number and types of comedications , in different age groups of the PLWH. The median ( range) age of patients was 45 ( 18-90) years , and 90.4 % were men. Of the 1445 patients , 972 ( 67.3 %) had at least one chronic comorbidity. Common chronic comorbidities included lipid disorders ( 31.6 %) , diabetes ( 26.8 %) , hypertension ( 18.2 %) and hepatitis<disease> B/C coinfection ( 18.2 %). Patients in the older age groups had greater numbers of chronic comorbidities. The most common chronic comorbidities in the older age groups were hypertension , diabetes and lipid disorders. The majority of patients used at least one comedication , and those in the older age groups used greater numbers of comedications. The most common therapeutic category of comedication included antacids , antiflatulents and antiulcerants ( 31.7 %). Of 151 malignancies reported in 117 patients , 84 were AIDS-defining cancers and 67 were non-AIDS-defining cancers. Chronic comorbidities and comedications were common among PLWH in Japan taking antiretrovirals; particularly among older patients , who more frequently used comedications. This suggests the need for giving special attention to the appropriate management of this patient population.
