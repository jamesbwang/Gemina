  The flavivirus<pathogen> Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZV) became an international emergency within two years of its outbreak in the Americas. Dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( DENV<pathogen>) , which is also a flavivirus<pathogen> , causes significant clinical harm in equatorial regions. A common feature amongst flaviviruses like ZV and DENV<pathogen> is an icosahedral shell of exactly 180 copies of the envelope ( E) and membrane ( M) proteins anchored in a lipid membrane , which engulfs the viral RNA and capsid proteins. Host recognition by both ZV and DENV<pathogen> is linked to the presence of phosphatidylserine ( PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE) lipids in the viral lipidome. Glycosylation of Asn residues on the Zika<disease> E protein may be linked to ZV induced neuropathies. We carry out coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations of the E3M3 hexamer embedded in the ZV and DENV<pathogen> lipidomes , and we show that the proteins have a significantly different lipid footprint in the viral lipidome. PE lipids in DENV<pathogen> and PS lipids in ZV enrich near the protein hexamer. We attribute the difference to a higher number of cationic amino acids in the ZV M protein. We also show that the three glycosylation sites on ZV , but not on DENV<pathogen> , are conformationally variant. Our data shed new light on the lipid interactions , and thus the host recognition mechanisms of the two viruses , which may be molecular determinants of the neuropathies caused by the ZV.
