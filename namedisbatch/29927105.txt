  Coxiella<pathogen> burnetii<pathogen> is a highly infectious obligate intracellular bacterium<pathogen> and the etiological agent of the zoonosis Query ( Q) fever<disease> This Gram-negative gamma-proteobacterium has adapted to replicate within a specialized compartment in mammalian phagocytic cells , known as the Coxiella-containing vacuole ( CCV). Knowledge of critical characteristics of the CCV microenvironment ( e.g. , luminal pH) , analysis of the C.<pathogen> burnetii<pathogen> genome sequence , and strategic metabolic profiling have provided the basis for determining the physicochemical and nutritional conditions necessary to support axenic replication of C.<pathogen> burnetii<pathogen>. In this unit , the media currently utilized for axenic culture of C.<pathogen> burnetii<pathogen> are described , with emphasis on application. To aid in experimental reproducibility and interpretation of results , considerations and limitations are discussed. Lastly , expected results for C.<pathogen> burnetii<pathogen> axenic growth under control conditions are provided as a reference. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
