  Since the first widespread use of depleted uranium in military in the 1991 Gulf War , the so-called `` Gulf War Syndrome<disease> '' has been a topic of ongoing debate. However , a low number of reliable scientific papers demonstrating the extent of possible contamination as well as its connection to the health status of residents and deployed veterans has been published.
