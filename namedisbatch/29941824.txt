  For the first time , we aimed to estimate the burden of serious fungal infections or diseases ( SFD) and highlight national epidemiological features in Serbia. Data on population and underlining conditions were extracted from the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia , World Bank , the Institute of Public Health of Serbia , the World Health Organization , National reference laboratory for medical mycology , the national registries of Serbian professional societies , and relevant publications. The population structure/inhabitants in 2016 ( not including the autonomous region Kosovo & Metohija) was 7,058,322; with 6,041,743 adults ( 85.6 %). The populations at risk ( total cases per year) were: HIV<pathogen> infected 2441; acute myeloid leukemia<disease> 212; stem cell transplantation 151; solid organ transplants 59; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 250,302; adult asthmatics 311,806; adult cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> 65; pulmonary tuberculosis<disease> 898; lung cancer 7260; intensive care unit admissions 19,821; and renal support 520. Annual fungal<disease> disease<disease> cases estimated are: candidemia 518; invasive aspergillosis 619;
