  Stress can impair T cell-mediated immunity. To determine if infants with high stress responses had deficits in T-cell mediated immunity , we examined the association of pain-induced cortisol responsiveness with thymic function and vaccine responses in infants. This study was performed among 306 ( male = 153 and female = 153) participants of a randomized , controlled trial examining the effect of neonatal vitamin A supplementation on immune function in Bangladesh ( NCT01583972). Salivary cortisol was measured before and 20 min after a needle stick ( vaccination) at 6 weeks of age. The thymic index ( TI) was determined by ultrasonography at 1 , 6 , 10 and 15 weeks. T-cell receptor excision circle and blood T-cell concentrations were measured at 6 and 15 weeks. Responses to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG) , tetanus<disease> toxoid , hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> and oral poliovirus<pathogen> vaccination were assayed at 6 and 15 weeks. Cortisol responsiveness was negatively associated with TI at all ages ( p < .01) in boys only , was negatively associated with naïve helper T-cell concentrations in both sexes at both 6 ( p = .0035) and 15 weeks ( p = .0083) , and was negatively associated with the delayed-type hypersensitivity<disease> ( DTH) skin test response to BCG vaccination at 15 weeks ( p = .034) in both sexes. Infants with a higher cortisol response to pain have differences in the T-cell compartment and a lower DTH response to vaccination. Sex differences in the immune system were seen as early as 6 weeks of age in these healthy infants.
