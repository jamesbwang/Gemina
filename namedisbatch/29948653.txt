  Urea cycle disorders ( UCDs) are inherited metabolic diseases that lead to hyperammonemia. Neurodevelopmental outcomes of patients with UCDs depend on the maximum ammonia<pathogen> concentration ( MAC) in the blood during onset. MAC ≥ 360 μM is a marker of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. We investigated the neurodevelopmental outcomes and MAC at onset for 177 patients with UCDs in Japan ( median age , 8 years and 2 months; range , 10 days-72 years) , including 57 patients with male ornithine<disease> transcarbamylase ( OTCD) , 59 patients with female OTCD , 23 patients with carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 deficiency ( CPSD) , 28 patients with arginosuccinate synthetase deficiency , 9 patients with arginosuccinate lyase deficiency ( ALD) , and 1 patient with arginase 1 deficiency. Neurodevelopmental outcomes of patients with CPSD and ALD were poor because most had neonatal onset with blood MAC ≥ 300 μM at onset. Although OTCD , particularly female late-onset OTCD , has good neurodevelopmental outcomes among those with UCDs , it is not necessarily a mild disease with good long-term outcomes. Patients with severe UCDs and MAC ≥ 300 μM at onset should undergo liver transplantation ( LT). Moreover , this study suggested that if the onset of UCD began during the neonatal period , then even UCD patients with MAC < 300 μM at onset should undergo LT to protect the brain.
