  In recent years , the number of Lyme<disease> disease<disease> or borreliosis cases in Eurasia has been dramatically increasing. This tick-borne disease is caused by Borrelia<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> sensu lato , which includes B.<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> sensu stricto , the main species found in North<pathogen> America , and B.<pathogen> afzelii<pathogen> and B.<pathogen> garinii<pathogen> , which are primarily responsible for the disease in Eurasia. Currently , research on Lyme<disease> disease<disease> has focused mainly on B.<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> while B.<pathogen> afzelii<pathogen> and B.<pathogen> garinii<pathogen> , which cause disease with distinctly different symptoms , are less studied. The purpose of this study is to evaluate B.<pathogen> afzelii<pathogen> BO23 and B.<pathogen> garinii<pathogen> CIP 103362 as model organisms to study Eurasian Lyme<disease> disease<disease> To begin our analyses , we sequenced , annotated the chromosomes of both species and compared them to B.<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> strain B31. We also assayed shuttle vector , pBSV2 , for transformation efficacy and demonstrated that these strains can be cultured on solid media. In addition , we characterized how physicochemical parameters ( e.g. , oxygen , osmolarity , oxidative stress) affect both growth and motility of the bacteria. Finally , we describe each strain 's antibiotic susceptibility and accessed their ability to infect mice. In conclusion , B.<pathogen> afzelii<pathogen> BO23 was more practical for in vitro and in vivo studies than B.<pathogen> garinii<pathogen> CIP 103362.
