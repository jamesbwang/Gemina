  Influenza<disease> virus<pathogen> ( IV) infections cause severe respiratory illnesses that can be complicated by bacterial super-infections. Previously , we identified the cellular Raf-MEK-ERK cascade as a promising antiviral target. Inhibitors of MEK , such as CI-1040 , showed potent antiviral activity. However , it remained unclear if this inhibitor and its active form , ATR-002 , might sensitize host cells to either IV or secondary bacterial infections. To address these questions , we studied the anti-pathogen activity of ATR-002 in comparison to CI-1040 , particularly , its impact on Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>) , which is a major cause of IV super-infections. We analysed IV and S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> titres in vitro during super-infection in the presence and absence of the drugs and characterized the direct impact of ATR-002 on bacterial growth and phenotypic changes. Importantly , neither CI-1040 nor ATR-002 treatment led to increased bacterial titres during super-infection , indicating that the drug does not sensitize cells for bacterial infection. In contrast , we rather observed reduced bacterial titres in presence of ATR-002. Surprisingly , ATR-002 also led to reduced bacterial growth in suspension cultures , reduced stress- and antibiotic tolerance without resistance induction. Our data identified for the first time that a particular MEK-inhibitor metabolite exhibits direct antibacterial activity , which is likely due to interference with the bacterial PknB kinase/Stp phosphatase signalling system.
