  Dobrava-Belgrade<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( DOBV) is one of the emerging pathogens which have been reported during the last decades in Europe and have attracted the attention of researchers. The course of infection among humans may have a varied course- from the completely asymptomatic to the more severe forms , such as haemorrhagic fever<disease> with renal<disease> syndrome<disease> ( HFRS). DOBV is hosted and carried by rodents like Apodemus<pathogen> flavicollis<pathogen> or A.<pathogen> agrarius<pathogen> , which occur commonly in Europe. To-date , orthohantaviruses have been reported in Poland , both in humans and animals , but detailed country-scale studies have not yet been carried out. The aim of the study was molecular characterization of a strain which was found in A.<pathogen> flavicollis<pathogen> in south-eastern Poland. The phylogenetic analysis of the first Dobrava-Belgrade<pathogen> virus<pathogen> found in A.<pathogen> flavicollis<pathogen> in the subcarpathian region of south-eastern Poland , presented in this study , was performed after virus proliferation in cell culture and sequencing of specific PCR products. Based on genetic sequences of fragments of three segments ( S , M and L) , the isolated virus was assigned to the Dobrava genotype , taking into consideration the most current classification of the DOBV species. The Dobrava-Belgrade<pathogen> virus<pathogen> strain isolated from A.<pathogen> flavicollis<pathogen> in the subcarpathian region of south-eastern Poland , has been molecularly characterized and assigned to Dobrava genotype , thereby the occurrence of that genotype in Poland has been confirmed by molecular techniques.
