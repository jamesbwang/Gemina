  The Ebola<disease> virus ( EBOV<pathogen>) matrix protein VP40 drives budding of virions and encodes 2 overlapping late domain motifs at amino acid positions 7-13 ( PTAPPEY). However , these motifs are not absolutely essential for replication in cell culture , and recently a potential third late domain motif ( YPx ( 6) I) was proposed at amino acid positions 18-26 of VP40. To analyze the importance of this motif in viral budding , we used a transcription and replication-competent virus-like particle system. Using this system , we show that this motif does not contribute to EBOV<pathogen> budding or particle propagation.
