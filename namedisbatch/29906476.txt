  The hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) is a globally prevalent infectious pathogen. As many as 80 % of people infected with HCV<pathogen> do not control the virus and develop a chronic<disease> infection<disease>. Response to interferon ( IFN) therapy is widely variable in chronic HCV<pathogen> infected patients , suggesting that HCV<pathogen> has evolved mechanisms to suppress and evade innate immunity responsible for its control and elimination. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 ( ADAR1) is a relevant factor in the regulation of the innate immune response. The loss of ADAR1 RNA-editing activity and the resulting loss of inosine bases in RNA are critical in producing aberrant RLR-mediated innate immune response , mediated by RNA sensors MDA5 and RIG-I. Here , we describe ADAR1 role as a regulator of innate and antiviral immune function in HCV<pathogen> infection , both in vitro and in patients. Polymorphisms within ADAR1 gene were found significantly associated to poor clinical outcome to HCV<pathogen> therapy and advanced liver fibrosis<disease> in a cohort of HCV<pathogen> and HIV-1 coinfected patients. Moreover , ADAR1 knockdown in primary macrophages and Huh7 hepatoma cells enhanced IFN and IFN stimulated gene expression and increased HCV<pathogen> replication in vitro. Overall , our results demonstrate that ADAR1 regulates innate immune signaling and is an important contributor to the outcome of the HCV<pathogen> virus-host interaction. ADAR1 is a potential target to boost antiviral immune response in HCV<pathogen> infection.
