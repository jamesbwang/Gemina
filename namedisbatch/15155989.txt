  Transfusion-transmitted leishmaniasis<disease> has been a concern in regions endemic for the disease. Whether immediate or delayed , the risks posed by this mode of transmission call for careful assessment. The purpose of this study was to detect Leishmania<pathogen> infection in blood donors living in an endemic area and to investigate progression to the disease in these individuals. Immunofluorescent antibody test , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , leishmaniasis<disease> rapid test , and the polymerase chain reaction were applied to 430 donors in an initial evaluation. Of those donors with at least one positive test , 50 were reevaluated four years later by the same methods , as were 25 controls who had been negative on the same tests. In the first evaluation , Leishmania<pathogen> infection was detected in 41.4 % ( 95 % CI: 36.7-46.1) of donors ( n = 430). None of the 75 reevaluated individuals had developed the disease , but retesting revealed positivity in at least one test in 36.0 % ( 95 % CI: 25.1-46.9) of donors. Of the 50 initially testing positive , 50 % remained so on retesting. Of the 25 initially negative controls , two tested positive in the subsequent evaluation. The severity of the parasitosis and the risk of transfusion transmission warrant investigation of the potential inclusion of methods for Leishmania<pathogen> detection into blood banks for effective screening of infected donors.
