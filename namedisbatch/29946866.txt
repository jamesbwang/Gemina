  Research is critical for developing HIV<pathogen> and tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) programming for U.S. African-born communities , and depends on successful recruitment of African-born people. From January 2014 to June 2016 , we recruited African-born people for HIV<pathogen> and TB research in King County , Washington. We compared the characteristics of study participants and the underlying populations of interest , and assessed recruitment strategies. Target enrollment for the HIV<pathogen> study was 167 participants; 51 participants ( 31 %) were enrolled. Target enrollment for the TB study was 218 participants; 38 ( 17 %) were successfully recruited. Of 249 prior TB patients we attempted to contact by phone , we reached 72 ( 33 %). Multiple recruitment strategies were employed with variable impact. Study participants differed from the underlying populations in terms of gender , country of origin and language. Inequities in research participation and in meaningful opportunities for such participation may exacerbate existing health disparities.
