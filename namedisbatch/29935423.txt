  Arboviruses such as Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV , Flaviviridae; Flavivirus<pathogen>) must replicate in both mammalian and insect hosts possessing strong immune defenses. Accordingly , transmission between and replication within hosts involves genetic bottlenecks , during which viral population size and genetic diversity may be significantly reduced. To help quantify these bottlenecks and their effects , we constructed 4 `` barcoded '' ZIKV populations that theoretically contain thousands of barcodes each. After identifying the most diverse barcoded virus , we passaged this virus 3 times in 2 mammalian and mosquito cell lines and characterized the population using deep sequencing of the barcoded region of the genome. C6/36 maintain higher barcode diversity , even after 3 passages , than Vero. Additionally , field-caught mosquitoes exposed to the virus to assess bottlenecks in a natural host. A progressive reduction in barcode diversity occurred throughout systemic<disease> infection<disease> of these mosquitoes. Differences in bottlenecks during systemic spread were observed between different populations of Aedes<pathogen> aegypti.
