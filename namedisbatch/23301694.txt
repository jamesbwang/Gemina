  Cholera<disease> continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and is now endemic in Haiti since first being introduced in 2010. Cholera<disease> and HIV<pathogen> have significant geographic overlap globally , but little is known about the clinical features and risk of cholera<disease> among HIV-infected people and their households. We assessed HIV-affected households originally recruited for a randomized controlled trial of food supplements. We assessed for correlation between household and individual factors and reported history of cholera<disease> since 2010 using univariable and multivariable analyses. There were 352 HIV-infected household members , 32 with reported history of medically attended cholera<disease> , and 1968 other household members , 55 with reported history of medically attended cholera<disease> Among HIV-infected individuals in this study , no variables correlated with reported history of cholera<disease> in univariable analyses. Among all household members , known HIV<pathogen> infection ( adjusted odds ratio ( AOR) , 3.75; 95 % CI , 2.43-5.79; Known HIV<pathogen> infection , source of household income , time required to fetch water , and severe household food insecurity were independently associated with reported history of medically attended cholera<disease> in HIV-affected households in rural Haiti. Further research is required to better understand the interactions between HIV<pathogen> and
