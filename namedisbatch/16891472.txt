  Despite increasing understanding of the pathobiology of acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) , outcomes remain dismal particularly for patients over the age of 60 years , a population enriched for therapy-related AML ( tAML) and secondary AML ( sAML). For decades , the standard of care for AML has been the combination of cytarabine and daunorubicin , typically delivered in combination as `` 7 + 3 '' induction. In 2017 , a liposomal-encapsulated combination of daunorubicin and cytarabine ( CPX-351 , Vyxeos) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) for use in the treatment of newly diagnosed tAML or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes ( AML-MRCs). CPX-351 was designed to deliver a fixed 5:1 molar ratio of cytarabine and daunorubicin , respectively , based on the hypothesis that ratiometric dosing may be more effective than the delivery of either drug at their maximum tolerated dose. In a Phase III trial of older patients with sAML aged 60-75 years , CPX-351 was compared to `` 7 + 3 '' and was associated with a higher overall survival , event-free survival , and higher rates of complete remission ( CR) and CR with incomplete hematologic recovery ( CRi). These data were the basis for the approval of this new drug for use in the treatment of AML , but questions remain regarding how to best administer this agent<pathogen> across AML subgroups. Future directions include evaluating dose intensification with CPX-351 , combining this agent<pathogen> with targeted therapies , and better understanding the mechanism of improved responses in tAML and AML-MRC , two entities that are historically less responsive to cytotoxic agents. In summary , CPX-351 offers an exciting new change to the landscape of AML therapy.
