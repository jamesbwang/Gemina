  It has been shown that microRNAs ( miRNAs) play key roles in variety of biological processes associated with human<disease> diseases<disease>. In Consideration of the cost and complexity of biological experiments , computational methods for predicting potential associations between miRNAs and diseases would be an effective complement. This paper presents a novel model of Inductive Matrix Completion for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction ( IMCMDA). The integrated miRNA similarity and disease similarity are calculated based on miRNA functional similarity , disease semantic similarity and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity. The main idea is to complete the missing miRNA-disease association based on the known associations and the integrated miRNA similarity and disease similarity. IMCMDA achieves AUC of 0.8034 based on leave-one-out-cross-validation and improved previous models. In addition , IMCMDA was applied to five common human<disease> diseases<disease> in three types<pathogen> of case studies. In the first type , respectively , 42 , 44 , 45 out of top 50 predicted miRNAs of Colon Neoplasms , Kidney Neoplasms , Lymphoma were confirmed by experimental reports. In the second type of case study for new diseases without any known miRNAs , we chose Breast Neoplasms as the test example by hiding the association information between the miRNAs and Breast Neoplasms. As a result , 50 out of top 50 predicted Breast Neoplasms-related miRNAs are verified. In the third type of case study , IMCMDA was tested on HMDD V1 .0 to assess the robustness of IMCMDA , 49 out of top 50 predicted Esophageal Neoplasms-related miRNAs are verified.
