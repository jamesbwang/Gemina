  Being able to track bacterial pathogens is essential for epidemiological purposes as well as monitoring in-house production facilities. Common bacterial pathogens , such as Salmonella serovars , are already been well defined , and their detection methods are very advanced. However , this will not be the case for emergent bacterial pathogens , as was the case for Cronobacter<pathogen>. The clinical significance of the organism is due to its association with rare sporadic infections in adults , and severe life-threatening outbreaks of necrotizing enterocolitis<disease> and meningitis<disease> in newborn babies. The main recognized route of infection being through the consumption of contaminated reconstituted powdered infant formula. Key to the advances in being able to track this organism during formula production and outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units has been the use of DNA sequence-based methods , and most recently those which profile whole-genome sequences. This chapter considers how the latest DNA sequence-based methods in genotyping Cronobacter<pathogen> serve as a model for analyzing emergent bacterial pathogens in the future. The methods considered will initially highlight the limitations of phenotyping , then advance from the DNA probe-based methods for serotyping through to DNA sequence-based methods , especially multilocus sequence typing which is supported by an open access database. Finally the development of typing methods based on whole-genomes sequences , CRISPR-cas array profiling and SNP analysis , will be covered. The overall perspective is that emergent pathogens need to be investigated with the most advanced methods in order for robust and reliable control measures to be adopted.
