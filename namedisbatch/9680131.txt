  The complement system bridges innate and adaptive immunity against microbial infections , with viral<disease> infection<disease> being a major trigger. Activation of the classical , alternative , and lectin pathways have been reported in chronic hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection and/or cryoglobulinemia. HCV<pathogen> infection leads to dysregulation of complement-mediated immune responses. Clinical and experimental evidence support involvement of complement in intra- and extrahepatic manifestations of HCV<pathogen> infection , such as liver fibrosis<disease> and type II cryoglobulinemia. In this review , we summarize studies that have investigated the interplay between HCV<pathogen> and the complement system to establish chronic<disease> infection<disease> and autoimmunity , as well as the association between HCV<pathogen> pathogenesis and abnormal complement profiles. Several unanswered questions are highlighted which suggest additional informative lines of investigation.
