  The global burden of disease caused by respiratory<pathogen> syncytial<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( RSV<pathogen>) is increasingly recognised , not only in infants , but also in older adults ( aged â‰¥ 65 years). Advances in knowledge of the structural biology of the RSV<pathogen> surface fusion glycoprotein have revolutionised RSV<pathogen> vaccine development by providing a new target for preventive interventions. The RSV<pathogen> vaccine landscape has rapidly expanded to include 19 vaccine candidates and monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs) in clinical trials , reflecting the urgency of reducing this global health problem and hence the prioritisation of RSV<pathogen> vaccine development. The candidates include mAbs and vaccines using four approaches: ( 1) particle-based , ( 2) live-attenuated or chimeric , ( 3) subunit , ( 4) vector-based. Late-phase RSV<pathogen> vaccine trial failures highlight gaps in knowledge regarding immunological protection and provide lessons for future development. In this Review , we highlight promising new approaches for RSV<pathogen> vaccine design and provide a comprehensive overview of RSV<pathogen> vaccine candidates and mAbs in clinical development to prevent one of the most common and severe infectious<disease> diseases<disease> in young children and older adults worldwide.
