  In meta-population models for infectious<disease> diseases<disease> , the basic reproduction number ( Formula: see text) can be as much as 70 % larger in the case of preferential mixing than that in homogeneous mixing ( J.W. Glasser , Z. Feng , S.B. Omer , P.J. Smith , and L.E. Rodewald , The effect of heterogeneity in uptake of the measles<pathogen> , mumps<disease> , and rubella<pathogen> vaccine on the potential for outbreaks of measles<pathogen>: A modelling study , Lancet ID 16 ( 2016) , pp. 599-605. doi: 10.1016/ S1473-3099 ( 16) 00004-9). This suggests that realistic mixing can be an important factor to consider in order for the models to provide a reliable assessment of intervention strategies. The influence of mixing is more significant when the population is highly heterogeneous. In this paper , another quantity , the final epidemic size ( ( Formula: see text)) of an outbreak , is considered to examine the influence of mixing and population heterogeneity. Final size relation is derived for a meta-population model accounting for a general mixing. The results show that ( Formula: see text) can be influenced by the pattern of mixing in a significant way. Another interesting finding is that , heterogeneity in various sub-population characteristics may have the opposite effect on ( Formula: see text) and ( Formula: see text).
