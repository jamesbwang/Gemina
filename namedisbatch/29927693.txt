  When the meningococcus B vaccine was introduced into Italy in 2017 , it was recommended for newborns based on national epidemiological data indicating that they were at greater risk. However , the vaccination service of the local health authority of L'Aquila had already been receiving spontaneous parental requests to provide vaccination for children in lower-risk age groups from the beginning of 2016. We therefore decided to use a self-administered questionnaire in order to investigate the parents ' socio-demographic data; their children 's history of other recommended vaccinations ( against measles<pathogen> , mumps<disease> and rubella<pathogen> , varicella , meningococcus C and , for females , human papilloma virus); the information sources concerning meningococcal vaccination; and the timing of its administration. The questionnaire was completed by 565 parents , and the results showed that the requests mainly came from the parents of children aged 5-11 years. The children whose mothers had received a high school education and were > 35 years old were more likely to have received the first dose after the age of one year and to have perceived pain at the inoculation site , and less likely to have experienced mild general reactions. The requests were mainly trigged by the recommendations of healthcare professionals , and the overloading of the vaccination service led to delays in the administration of the doses after the first. The delays ( reported by 74.07 % of the parents) were mainly due to organisational problems in the service itself , which led 61.52 % of the doses being more appropriately administered by staff working as private physicians inside public health facilities , albeit at extra cost. These findings indicate that organisational factors and excessive demand had a considerable impact on both the efficacy of the immunisation and its appropriateness.
