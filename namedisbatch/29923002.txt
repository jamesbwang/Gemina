  Antiviral efficiency of oxidized dextrans ( OD) with different molecular weights and oxidation degree ( OD40min , OD70min , OD40max , and OD70 max) was studied in vitro and in vivo. Dextrans OD40max and OD70max prevented the development of the cytopathic effect of influenza<disease> A<pathogen> ( H1N1<pathogen>) pdm09 virus in more than 50 % MDCK cells vs. control ( no OD). Four intranasal doses of OD40min , OD40max , and OD70min and one intranasal dose of OD70max before infection of BALB/c mice with A ( H1N1<pathogen>) pdm09 influenza<disease> virus<pathogen> significantly reduced mortality and prolonged life span in comparison with controls receiving saline. These and our previous data attest to clear-cut preventive effect of OD in influenza<disease> infection.
