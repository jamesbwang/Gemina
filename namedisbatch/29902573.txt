  Several biogeographic hypotheses have been proposed to explain connections between Amazonian and Atlantic forest<disease> biotas. These hypotheses are related to the timing of the connections and their geographic patterns. We performed a phylogeographic investigation of Tyrant-manakins ( Aves: Pipridae , Neopelma/Tyranneutes) which include species inhabiting the Amazon and Atlantic forests , as well as gallery forests of the Cerrado. Using DNA sequence data , we determined phylogenetic relationships , temporal and geographic patterns of diversification , and recent intraspecific population genetic patterns , relative to the history of these biomes. We found Neopelma to be a paraphyletic genus , as N. chrysolophum is sister to Neopelma + Tyranneutes , with an estimated divergence of approximately 18 Myrs BP , within the oldest estimated divergence times of other Amazonian and Atlantic forest<disease> avian taxa. Subsequent divergences in the group occurred from Mid Miocene to Early Pliocene and involved mainly the Amazonian species , with an expansion into and subsequent speciation in the Cerrado gallery forests by N. pallescens<pathogen>. We found additional structure within N. chrysocephalum and N. sulphureiventer. Analysis of recent population dynamics in N. chrysocephalum , N. sulphureiventer , and N. pallescens<pathogen> revealed recent demographic fluctuations and restrictions to gene flow related to environmental changes since the last glacial cycle. No genetic structure was detected across the Amazon River in N. pallescens<pathogen>. The tyrant-manakins represent an old historical connection between the Amazon and Atlantic Forest.
