  Social capital is a well-established predictor of several behavioral health outcomes. However , we know less about the relationship with prevention , transmission , and treatment of HIV/AIDS outcomes in the United States ( US). In 2017 , we conducted a scoping review of empirical studies investigating the relationships between social capital and HIV/AIDS in the US by searching PubMed , Embase , PsycINFO , Web of Science , and Sociological Abstracts with no restriction on publication date , for articles in English language. Sample search terms included: HIV<pathogen> infections OR HIV<pathogen> OR AIDS OR acquired immunodeficiency<disease> syndrome<disease> OR human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> We identified 1581 unique manuscripts and reviewed 13 based on eligibility criteria. The earliest eligible study was published in 2003. More than half ( n = 7/13) focused on HIV<pathogen> or AIDS diagnosis , then prescribing ART and/or adherence ( n = 5/13) , then linkage and or engagement in HIV<pathogen> care ( n = 4/13). Fifty eight percent ( 58 %) documented a protective association between at least one social capital measure and an HIV/AIDS outcome. Seven studies used validated social capital scales , however there was substantial variation in conceptual/operational definitions and measures used. Most studies were based on samples from the Northeast. Three studies directly focused on or stratified analyses among subgroups or key populations. Studies were cross-sectional , so causal inference is unknown. Our review suggests that social capital may be an important determinant of HIV/AIDS prevention , transmission , and treatment outcomes. We recommend future research assess these associations using qualitative and mixed-methods approaches , longitudinally , examine differences across subgroups and geographic region , include a wider range of social capital constructs , and examine indicators beyond HIV<pathogen> diagnosis , as well as how mechanisms like stigma link social capital to HIV/AIDS.
