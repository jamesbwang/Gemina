  Cryptosporidiosis is a parasitic zoonosis implicated in severe diarrhoea<disease> in pets and humans. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and genotypes of Cryptosporidium spp. in household dogs and in-contact children , and the risk factors associated with infection in children in Sharkia Province , Egypt. Fecal samples of 100 children ( 2-12 years old) and 50 dogs ( 3 months-1 year old) were randomly collected from both rural ( children: n = 85 , dogs: n = 40) and urban ( children: n = 15 , dogs: n = 10) households. Initial parasite detection was done by light microscopy , while , genotyping was based on molecular diagnostic assays. The overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. infection in children was 35 % using microscopy and 14 % using nested polymerase chain reaction ( PCR). In dogs , it was 34 % using microscopy and 24 % using nested PCR. Cryptosporidium spp. from children were identified as distinct genotypes , with the predominance of human genotype I ( Cryptosporidium hominis<pathogen>) over the zoonotic genotype II ( Cryptosporidium parvum<pathogen>). Moreover , only zoonotic genotype II ( C.<pathogen> parvum<pathogen>) was identified in dog samples. The significant risk factors associated with the prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection in children were the presence of diarrheal episodes during time of survey , improper disposal of garbage , and dog feces and contact with other livestock ( p â‰¤ 0.05). This study concluded that the existence of C.<pathogen> parvum<pathogen> in children and dogs residing the same households confirm the zoonotic transmission and its public health significance. Also , the study recommended the necessity of hygienic disposal of dog feces and preventing direct contact of dogs with other livestock.
