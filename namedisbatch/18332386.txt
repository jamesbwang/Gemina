  Endemic mycoses represent a growing public health challenge in North<pathogen> America. We describe the epidemiology of 1,392 microbiology laboratory-confirmed cases of blastomycosis , histoplasmosis , and coccidioidomycosis<disease> in Ontario during 1990-2015. Blastomycosis was the most common infection ( 1,092 cases; incidence of 0.41 cases/100 ,000 population) , followed by histoplasmosis ( 211 cases) and coccidioidomycosis<disease> ( 89 cases). Incidence of blastomycosis increased from 1995 to 2001 and has remained elevated , especially in the northwest region , incorporating several localized hotspots where disease incidence ( 10.9 cases/100 ,000 population) is 12.6 times greater than in any other region of the province. This retrospective study substantially increases the number of known endemic fungal infections reported in Canada , confirms Ontario as an important region of endemicity for blastomycosis and histoplasmosis , and provides an epidemiologic baseline for future disease surveillance. Clinicians should include blastomycosis and histoplasmosis in the differential diagnosis of antibiotic-refractory pneumonia<disease> in patients traveling to or residing in Ontario.
