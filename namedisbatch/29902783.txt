  The infection of blue whiting Micromesistius poutassou from the western Mediterranean Sea , off the eastern coast of Spain , with larvae of Anisakis<pathogen> spp. was studied. Between April 2016 and April 2017 , 140 fish were analyzed. Total epidemiological data showed that the prevalence of Anisakis<pathogen> spp. was 29.3 % and the mean intensity 1.8. Of the 74 larvae collected , 61 % were type I and the remaining 39 % , type II. Of the former , 91 % were molecularly identified as Anisakis<pathogen> pegreffii ( P = 19.3 %; MI = 1.4) , 2.2 % as Anisakis<pathogen> simplex<pathogen> s.s. ( P = 0.7 %; MI = 1.0) , while the rest ( 6.7 %) showed a recombinant genotype between the two ( P = 2.1 %; MI = 1.0). All the type II larvae analyzed were molecularly identified as Anisakis<pathogen> physeteris ( P = 10.0 %; MI = 2.1). Three fish ( 2.1 %) were found to have larvae in the muscle , while two were found with 1 larva of A. pegreffii and one with two larvae ( 1 A.<pathogen> simplex<disease> s.s. and 1 A. pegreffii). Statistical analysis showed that the prevalence of Anisakis<pathogen> spp. in blue whiting was higher in spring than in autumn ( P < 0.001) , probably due to the greater size ( and age) of the fish and related to factors as diet shift , accumulation with age and higher food intake. Analysis of the data suggested that blue whiting were first infected with Anisakis<pathogen> type I ( mean age 2.3 years) and later with Anisakis type II ( mean age 2.7 years) , probably due to the diet changing with age , with the incorporation of the paratenic/intermediate host species of these parasites. In any case , the public health authorities must continue to emphasize the need for suitable thermal treatment ( freezing or cooking) of the fish prior to consumption.
