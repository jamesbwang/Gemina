  During its life cycle , Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) , an arthropod-borne flavivirus<pathogen> that is associated with Guillain-Barr√© syndrome<disease> and causes microencephaly in fetuses and newborn children , encodes a critical and indispensable helicase domain that has 5 '- triphosphatase activity and performs ATP hydrolysis to generate energy and thus , sustains unwinding of double-stranded RNA during ZIKV genome replication. Of these processes , ATP hydrolysis represents the most basic event; however , its dynamic mechanisms remain largely unknown , impeding the further understanding of the function of ZIKV helicase and the ongoing anti-ZIKV drug design. In this work , we determined the crystal structure of ZIKV helicase in complex with ADP-AlF
