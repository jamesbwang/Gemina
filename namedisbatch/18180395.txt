  Vitamin D deficiency is a prevalent condition in Iran and previous studies have shown that a low level of serum vitamin D is related to low ankle-brachial index ( ABI). In the present study , the relationship of the serum level of vitamin D with ABI , as an index for atherosclerosis of peripheral arteries , was evaluated. In this cross-sectional study , data on 91 patients with metabolic syndrome<disease> ( Mets) from the Isfahan<pathogen> Cohort Study ( ICS) were analyzed in order to evaluate the association between serum 25 ( OH) vitamin D level and ABI. The participants were divided into two groups; group A with desirable serum vitamin D level and group B with abnormal serum vitamin D level. ABI was measured and compared between these groups. A crude and adjusted model showed no association between vitamin D level and ABI in patients with MetS. It can be concluded that serum vitamin D level could not affect ABI in patients with MetS.
