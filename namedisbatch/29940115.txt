  Clinically , leukemia<disease> patients often suffer from the limited efficacy of chemotherapy and high risks of infection by invasive fungal pathogens. Herein , a novel therapeutic strategy was developed in which a small molecule can simultaneously treat leukemia<disease> and invasive fungal infections ( IFIs). Novel Janus kinase 2 ( JAK2) and histone deacetylase ( HDAC) dual inhibitors were identified to possess potent anti-proliferative activity toward hematological cell lines and excellent synergistic effects with fluconazole to treat resistant Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> infections. In particular , compound 20a , a highly active and selective JAK2/HDAC6 dual inhibitor , showed excellent in vivo antitumor efficacy in several acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) models and synergized with fluconazole for the treatment of resistant C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> infections. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of JAK2/HDAC dual inhibitors in treating AML and IFIs and provides an efficient strategy for multitargeting drug discovery.
