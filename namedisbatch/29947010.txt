  To estimate the impact of viral hepatitis<disease> B<disease> status on outcomes of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. We searched Pubmed and Embase for original articles that evaluated the impact of hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection on outcomes of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The present study was conducted to generate odd ratios ( ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) for pre-identified prognostic factors , overall survival , and recurrence. From 438 studies , we identified eight articles that compared outcomes between hepatitis<disease> B<disease> virus-infected patients and the others. In terms of clinicopathological characteristics , patients in the hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> group significantly demonstrated single nodular tumor ( OR 0.7; 95 % CI 0.5-0.9; p = 0.01) , infrequent lymph node metastasis ( OR 0.5; 95 % CI 0.3-0.6; p < 0.01) , and infrequent perineural infiltration ( OR 0.3; 95 % CI 0.2-0.8; p < 0.01). No significant between-group differences were found in tumor diameter , vascular invasion , and tumor differentiation. Previous or temporary infection ( seropositivity for hepatitis<disease> B<disease> core antibody) revealed no significant impact on clinicopathological characteristics. For survival outcomes , meta-analysis demonstrated that hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> group had significantly better overall survival , recurrence rate , and median survival ( p < 0.01). Our results suggest that hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection is a powerful predictor of favorable survival outcomes for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and significantly affects clinicopathological characteristics. Viral hepatitis<disease> B<disease> status needs to be taken into account and then establish therapeutic approaches.
