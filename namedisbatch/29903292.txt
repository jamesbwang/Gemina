  To develop a Cronobacter<pathogen> spieces identification PCR method based on RNA polymerase beta subunit ( rpo B) gene and identify species of Cronobacter<pathogen> isolated from different sources. A total of 7 primer pairs based on the rpo B were design , and 9 standard strains were set as reference strains to identify species of261 strains isolated from infant formula foods , cereal based foods and clinical diarrhea<disease> cases in 2012-2014 in China. The molecular weight of 9 standard strains were as same as expect , 179 of 216 Cronobacter<pathogen> isolates were C.<pathogen> sakazakii<pathogen> , 56 were C. malonaticus , 13 were C. universalis , 11 were C. dublinensis , 2 were C. turicensis<pathogen> , accounted for 68. 58 % , 21. 46 % , 4. 98 % , 4. 21 % and 0. 77 % of the total isolates , respectively. The Cronobacter<pathogen> species identification PCR system is specific , convenient , sensitive. This system can provide technical support for Cronobacter<pathogen> risk surveillance and control in China.
