  While infectious<disease> agents<disease> have typical host preferences , the noninvasive enteric bacterium<pathogen> Vibrio<pathogen> cholerae<disease> is remarkable for its ability to survive in many environments , yet cause diarrheal disease ( cholera<disease> only in humans. One key V.<pathogen> cholerae<disease> virulence factor is its neuraminidase ( VcN) , which releases host intestinal epithelial sialic acids as a nutrition source and simultaneously remodels intestinal polysialylated gangliosides into monosialoganglioside GM1. GM1 is the optimal binding target for the B subunit of a second virulence factor , the AB5 cholera<disease> toxin ( Ctx). This coordinated process delivers the CtxA subunit into host epithelia , triggering fluid loss via cAMP-mediated activation of anion secretion and inhibition of electroneutral NaCl absorption. We hypothesized that human-specific and human-universal evolutionary loss of the sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid ( Neu5Gc) and the consequent excess of N-acetylneuraminic acid ( Neu5Ac) contributes to specificity at one or more steps in pathogenesis. Indeed , VcN was less efficient in releasing Neu5Gc than Neu5Ac. We show enhanced binding of Ctx to sections of small intestine and isolated polysialogangliosides from human-like Neu5Gc-deficient Cmah-/- mice compared to wild-type , suggesting that Neu5Gc impeded generation of the GM1 target. Human epithelial cells artificially expressing Neu5Gc were also less susceptible to Ctx binding and CtxA intoxication following VcN treatment. Finally , we found increased fluid secretion into loops of Cmah-/- mouse small intestine injected with Ctx , indicating an additional direct effect on ion transport. Thus , V.<pathogen> cholerae<disease> evolved into a human-specific pathogen partly by adapting to the human evolutionary loss of Neu5Gc , optimizing multiple steps in cholera<disease> pathogenesis.
