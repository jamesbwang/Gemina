  Progression of hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection ( HBV<pathogen>) might be affected by host genetic factors. The present study was undertaken to study the role of glutathione S-transferases ( GST)- M1 and T1 gene polymorphisms in different stages of HBV<pathogen> infection: HBV inactive carrier , chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> and cirrhosis , and cryptogenic cirrhosis. The study population comprised of 170 subjects; 120 cases ( HBV inactive carrier , The GSTM1 null genotype was seen more commonly in hepatitis<disease> B<disease> cirrhosis ( The patients with GSTM1 null genotype are at risk of progression of liver disease as the frequency of GSTM1 null genotype was found to be significantly higher in chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> , hepatitis<disease> B<disease> cirrhosis and cryptogenic cirrhosis as compared with controls.
