  Infections during Immunosuppression Abstract. Immunomodulating and immunosuppressive therapies are being used more and more frequently. Depending on the mechanism of action and the underlying disease , there is an increased risk of infection with these therapies. In everyday clinical practice , the individual risk of infection depends on a large number of patients , and environmental as well as pathogen-specific factors. Elderly and multimorbid patients are at particular risk of infection. Classical bacterial infections with possible atypical manifestation , hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> , herpes<disease> viruses , mycobacteria and other granulomatous infections are prevalent. Typical clinical signs of infections may be missing and laboratory chemical parameters may fail as diagnostic tools. Systematic screening for latent or chronic<disease> infections<disease> prior to initiation and close monitoring of patients during immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapy are necessary to reduce morbidity and mortality.
