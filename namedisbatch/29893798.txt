  Clostridium<pathogen> difficile-associated diarrhea<disease> ( CDAD) is common during hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation ( HSCT) and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We evaluated fidaxomicin for prevention of CDAD in HSCT patients. In this double-blind study , subjects undergoing HSCT with fluoroquinolone prophylaxis stratified by transplant type ( autologous/allogeneic) were randomized to once-daily oral fidaxomicin 200 mg or matching placebo. Dosing began within 2 days of starting conditioning or fluoroquinolone prophylaxis and continued until 7 days after neutrophil engraftment or completion of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis/clinically indicated antimicrobials for up to 40 days. The primary endpoint was CDAD incidence through 30 days after study medication. The primary endpoint analysis counted confirmed CDAD , receipt of CDAD-effective medications ( for any indication) , and missing CDAD assessment ( for any reason , including death) as failures; this composite analysis is referred to as `` prophylaxis failure '' to distinguish from the pre-specified sensitivity analysis , which counted only confirmed CDAD ( by toxin immunoassay or nucleic acid amplification test) as failure. Of 611 subjects enrolled , 600 were treated and analyzed. Prophylaxis failure was similar in fidaxomicin and placebo recipients ( 28.6 % vs 30.8 %; difference 2.2 % ( -5.1 , 9.5) , p = 0.278). However , most failures were due to non-CDAD events. Confirmed CDAD was lower in fidaxomicin vs placebo recipients ( 4.3 % vs 10.7 %; difference 6.4 % ( 2.2 , 10.6) , p = 0.0014). Drug-related adverse events occurred in 15.0 % of fidaxomicin recipients and 20.0 % of placebo recipients. While no difference was demonstrated between arms in the primary analysis , results of the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that fidaxomicin significantly reduced the incidence of CDAD in HSCT recipients.
