  The most commonly used culture medium for the in vitro isolation of Leishmania<pathogen> spp. from canine biological samples is biphasic Novy-MacNeal-Nicolle ( NNN) medium<pathogen> , whose solid phase is prepared using rabbit blood. Leishmania<pathogen> infantum parasites from natural infections are highly sensitive and demanding for growth in axenic conditions when firstly obtained from the dog 's body. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether NNN medium ( NNN-test) prepared with chicken blood ( NNN-C) , ox blood ( NNN-O) , horse blood ( NNN-H) or sheep blood ( NNN-S) was viable for the isolation of parasites from naturally infected dogs , in an endemic area for visceral leishmaniasis<disease> caused by L. infantum. Spleen aspirates from six dogs previously diagnosed as infected by parasitological methods were simultaneously inoculated in each NNN-test medium , including the conventional medium prepared with rabbit blood ( NNN-R) , and the cultures were examined for three weeks under optic microscopy. Spleen samples were also analyzed for parasite loads by quantitative PCR ( qPCR). Cultures from three of the six dogs ( 50 %) were positive in at least one of the NNN-test media: one sample presented the highest spleen parasite load by qPCR ( 1.19 Ã— 10
