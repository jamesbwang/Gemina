  The liver plays a key role in the metabolism of proteins. Liver dysfunction affects many organs because it communicates with the spleen and all digestive organs through the portal vein. Additionally , the kidney is an organ that is closely related to the liver and is involved in liver diseases. Glomerulonephritis<disease> is an important extrahepatic manifestation of chronic hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) infection. Nucleos ( t) ide analog ( NA) therapy effectively suppresses HBV replication by inhibiting HBV polymerase , thus decreasing the levels of serum HBV-DNA and delaying the progression of cirrhosis. Although NA therapy is recommended for all patients with chronic HBV<pathogen> infection , regardless of the level of renal dysfunction , there is limited information on NA use in patients with chronic kidney disease. In addition , in patients with end-stage liver cirrhosis , hepatorenal syndrome<disease> can be fatal. Hence , we should take into account the stage of impaired renal function in patients with cirrhosis. The aims of this article are to review the epidemiology , clinical presentation , treatment , and prevention of HBV-associated nephropathy.
