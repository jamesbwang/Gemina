  A two-stage approach to total knee arthroplasty ( TKA) using an antibiotic-impregnated articulating cement spacer is an option for an infected arthritic knee. Vancomycin combined with broad-spectrum antibiotics can be used to make an antibiotic-impregnated articulating cement spacer. Causative organisms are sometimes not confirmed before surgery. Joint infections of multidrug-resistant organisms are increasing. Therefore , routine combinations of antibiotics may not be effective. We present a case of a patient who developed vancomycin-resistant Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> infection in an arthritic knee. A 71-year-old man was initially diagnosed with pyogenic<disease> arthritis<disease> caused by Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> He underwent arthroscopic debridement elsewhere. However , the infection persisted. He was referred to our hospital , and we performed a two-stage TKA using a vancomycin-based antibiotic-impregnated articulating cement spacer. Vancomycin-resistant P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> was identified after surgery. Intravenous colistin was added. However , this failed , either because vancomycin was not effective against P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> , or because insufficient systemic colistin due to colistin-induced acute kidney injury. Therefore , debridement was repeated , and colistin-loaded cement spacer was inserted. The spacer delivered high concentrations of colistin to the infected joint with decreased systemic effects. Thus , less systemic colistin was used. The infection was controlled without recurrent acute kidney injury. One year after surgery , conversion to TKA was successfully performed. A two-stage approach to TKA using a colistin-loaded articulating cement spacer can be used for an arthritic knee infected by vancomycin-resistant P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen>. Furthermore , local administration of colistin using a cement spacer can reduce the systemic side effects of colistin.
