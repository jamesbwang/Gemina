  To describe the aerobic conjunctival bacterial flora of 3 especies of free-living and under human care sea turtles and determine its antimicrobial susceptibility in vitro. Thirty-six sea turtles ( 72 eyes) , juveniles and adults , 7 free-living Chelonia mydas and 8 Chelonia mydas , 4 Caretta caretta , 11 Eretmochelys imbricata<disease> , and 6 Lepidochelys olivacea<pathogen> under human care , were evaluated. Conjunctival cultures were collected for identification of aerobic bacteria and antimicrobial susceptibility testing for ciprofloxacin , chloramphenicol , gentamicin , neomycin , oxacillin , polymyxin B , tetracycline , and tobramycin using antibiotic disks. Bacterial strains showing no sensitivity to 4 or more antimicrobials were considered multiresistant to this panel. Bacterial growth was observed in 12/14 ( 85.71 %) samples in the free-living sea turtles , and there was growth in 100 % ( 58/58) of the samples from captive animals. There were 94 strains isolated and 15 species identified. There was a predominance of Gram-positive bacteria in free-living Chelonia mydas , most of which were Bacillus<pathogen> and Staphylococcus<pathogen>. The most commonly isolated Gram-negative species were enterobacteria for free-living and under human care animals. The strains were predominantly sensitive to ciprofloxacin and tobramycin , and less sensitive to oxacillin or polymyxin B. Ten multiresistant strains were isolated. Yeast were identified in 13.89 % ( 10/72) of the samples. These results , showing differences in the conjunctival bacterial flora of free-living and captive animals , may be helpful for diagnosis and treatment of ocular disorders in sea turtles.
