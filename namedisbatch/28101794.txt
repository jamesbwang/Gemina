  To examine the clinical pattern of foot-related complications in type 2 diabetes patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted among indoor , adult type 2 diabetes patients with risk factors for diabetic foot complications. The diabetic neuropathy symptom score ( DNSS) , Doppler scanning , ankle brachial pressure index ( ABPI) assessment , neuropathy assessment , neuropathic disability score ( NDS) , biothesiometry evaluation , and bacteriological examination was performed. Diabetic foot risk stratification was done using the NICE risk stratification system. Foot ulcer<disease> severity was assessed with the Lipsky severity grading system. Ninety-one patients ( mean age 59 years; male 65.9 %) were included , of which 20 ( 22 %) had a history of ulcer<disease> and 40 ( 44 %) were smokers. Seventy-seven ( 83.5 %) patients had a neuropathy symptom score between 4 and 9. Biothesiometry vibration perception threshold ( VPT) was `` severe '' in 55 ( 60.4 %) patients. Doppler assessment showed triphasic flow in 53 patients ( 58.2 %). Out of 52 patients ( 57.1 %) with neuropathy , 30 ( 57.7 %) had a severe problem. Diabetic foot ulcer<disease> , cellulitis<disease> , and callus were present in 44 ( 48.3 %) , 29 ( 31.5 %) , and 11 ( 12.4 %) patients , respectively. Foot ulcers<disease> were present on 21 ( 38 %) metatarsal heads , 11 ( 20 %) toes , 10 ( 18 %) heels , 08 ( 15 %) ankles , and 05 ( 09 %) lateral foot borders. Of the 55 patients who underwent culture examination , 30 ( 33.3 %) showed the presence of Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> As per NICE risk stratification , 55 patients ( 60 %) were at `` very high risk. '' A foot ulcer<disease> is the commonest complication in diabetic patients followed by cellulitis<disease> Standardized simple noninvasive testing methods should be used to identify patients at risk for the diabetic foot. Multidisciplinary diabetic foot care could be useful to prevent diabetes-related amputation of the lower extremities.
