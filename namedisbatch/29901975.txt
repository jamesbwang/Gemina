  Tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) is still a threat to public health; in 2014 caused 1.5 million deaths worldwide; in hospitals where the prevalence of TB is low , it is appropriate to evaluate the effectiveness of tests to diagnose it. We reviewed reports of airway clinical specimens sent for studies of tuberculosis<disease> to the microbiology laboratory from Tec Salud System private hospitals ( 400 beds) in the metropolitan area of Monterrey , NL , from May 2012 to December 2015. In conjunction with Ziehl-Neelsen ( ZN) stain , and solid Lowenstein-Jensen medium ( LJ) , our laboratory resources also include fluorescent LED microscopy ( Carl Zeiss Microscopy Products) , MGIT 320 ( Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube liquid culture detection system , Becton Dickinson) , and recently incorporated a real-time PCR system the Xpert MTB/RIF test ( Cepheid , Sunnyvale , CA). In 731 respiratory specimens from 510 patients , M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> was isolated from 78 samples belonging to 50 patients on LJ and MGIT LJ 42 ( 84 %) and MGIT 49 , ( 98 %) of the samples. From 41 patients identified , 26 ( 63.4 %) were positive to fluorescein , and 25 ( 60.9 %) with Ziehl-Neelsen stain. Real time PCR ( Xpert TB) was positive in 13 out of 17 patient-airway samples ( 76.4 %). Usefulness of liquid culture ( MGIT) and solid culture ( LJ) is shown; the first can significantly cut incubation times.
