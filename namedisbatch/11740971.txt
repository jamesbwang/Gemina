  The April 2015 Nepal earthquake resulted in more than 8,700 deaths and 22,000 casualties including damage to health facilities. The impact of this situation on chronic conditions such as human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome<disease> ( HIV/AIDS) may become a long-lasting public health threat. Therefore , the objectives of this study were i) to assess the association of antiretroviral therapy ( ART) adherence with mental health problems , and social behaviors , ii) to examine factors affecting treatment failure , and iii) to investigate changes in ART adherence and post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) among people living with HIV<pathogen> 6 and 12 months after the disaster. Study was conducted 6 months after the earthquake in 2015 with a sample size of 305 earthquake victims with HIV<pathogen> and followed after 12 months of the earthquake. A logistic regression analysis was used to examine relationships , while a paired t-test analysis was conducted to assess changes in adherence to ART and PTSD level at 6 months and 12 months after earthquake. In the earthquake , 5.2 % of the participants lost their family member. Approximately 44 % of participants had earthquake-PTSD symptoms and 50 % experienced HIV<pathogen> stigma. PTSD and HIV<pathogen> status disclosure were significantly associated with adherence to ART , while HIV<pathogen> stigma and religion were associated with treatment failure. PTSD and adherence levels to ART were significantly improved over the 6-month period. Awareness programs for general public to eliminate HIV<pathogen> stigma; promote psychosocial counseling to earthquake victims living with HIV<pathogen> in order to reduce PTSD will contribute to maintaining optimal ART adherence and to prevent treatment failure.
