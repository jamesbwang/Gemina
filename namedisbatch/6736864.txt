  The currently unsurpassed diversity of photoreceptors found in the eyes of stomatopods , or mantis shrimps<disease> , is achieved through a variety of opsin-based visual pigments and optical filters. However , the presence of extraocular photoreceptors in these crustaceans is undescribed. Opsins have been found in extraocular tissues across animal taxa , but their functions are often unknown. Here , we show that the mantis shrimp<disease> Neogonodactylus oerstedii has functional cerebral photoreceptors , which expands the suite of mechanisms by which mantis shrimp<disease> sense light. Illumination of extraocular photoreceptors elicits behaviors akin to common arthropod escape responses , which persist in blinded individuals. The anterior central nervous system , which is illuminated when a mantis shrimp<disease> 's cephalothorax protrudes from its burrow to search for predators , prey , or mates , appears to be photosensitive and to feature two types<pathogen> of opsin-based , potentially histaminergic photoreceptors. A pigmented ventral eye that may be capable of color discrimination extends from the cerebral ganglion , or brain , against the transparent outer carapace , and exhibits a rapid electrical response when illuminated. Additionally , opsins and histamine are expressed in several locations of the eyestalks and cerebral ganglion , where any photoresponses could contribute to shelter-seeking behaviors and other functions.
