  Together with Treponema<pathogen> pallidum<pathogen> ssp. pertenue<pathogen> , Haemophilus ducreyi<pathogen> is a major cause of exudative cutaneous ulcers<disease> ( CU) in children. For H. ducreyi , both class I and class II strains , asymptomatic colonization , and environmental reservoirs have been found in endemic regions , but the epidemiology of this infection is unknown. Based on published whole genome sequences of H. ducreyi<pathogen> CU strains , a single locus typing system was developed and applied to H. ducreyi<pathogen> positive CU samples obtained prior to , one , and two years after the initiation of a mass drug administration campaign to eliminate CU on Lihir Island in Papua New Guinea. DNA from the CU samples was amplified with class I and class II dsrA-specific primers and sequenced; the samples were classified into dsrA types , which were geospatially mapped. Selection pressure analysis was performed on the dsrA sequences. Thirty-seven samples contained class I sequences , 27 contained class II sequences , and 13 contained both. There were 5 class I and 4 class II types circulating on the island<disease>; three types accounted for ~ 87 % of the strains. The composition and geospatial distribution of the types varied little over time and there was no evidence of selection pressure. Multiple strains of H. ducreyi<pathogen> cause CU on an endemic island<disease> and co-infections are common. In contrast recent findings with T. p. pertenue<pathogen> , strain composition is not affected by antibiotic pressure , consistent with environmental reservoirs of H. ducreyi<pathogen>. Such reservoirs must be addressed to achieve elimination of H.
