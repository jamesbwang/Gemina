  The impact of restrictive feeding programs on Salmonella<pathogen> and Campylobacter<pathogen> colonization and persistence after challenge was investigated for broiler breeder pullets housed in an experimental rearing facility. Pullet-chicks were placed on litter in 3 feeding program rooms and each room contained 2 replicate pens. The feeding programs were: ( 1) Skip-a-day in trough feeders ( SAD); ( 2) Every-day in trough feeders ( EDT); ( 3) Every-day on the pen litter ( EDL). On d 1 , an additional group of hatchmate chicks were housed in a separate room and gavaged with Salmonella<disease> Typhimurium<pathogen> , to later serve as seeder chicks. After seeders were confirmed Salmonella-positive at wk 4 , at wk 5 seeders were placed into each feeding program pen to commingle with 135 penmates. At 7 , 9 , 11 , 17 , 18 , and 20 wk the litter surface in each pen was sampled using intermittently stepped-on drag-swabs. At 8 , 12 , 16 , and 20 wk of age the ceca were sampled from 10 penmates/pen and 2 pooled spleen samples/pen were collected. SAD litter remained Salmonella-positive through 20 wk of age while EDL and EDT pens had no detectible litter Salmonella<pathogen> recovery by 18 and 20 wk. EDL fed pens had no direct ( < 102 cfu/mL) litter Salmonella<pathogen> recovery during the entirety of the experiment. Salmonella<pathogen> prevalence for ceca from SAD pullets was significantly ( P < 0.05) higher at 8 wk ( 70 %) compared to EDT ( 40 %) and EDL ( 30 %). At wk 12 , SAD pullets for both on and off-feed sampling days had significantly higher Salmonella<pathogen> recovery ( 40 %) , compared to EDT and EDL ( both at 5 % recovery). By 16 and 20 wk , only the SAD pullets on the on-feed day ( 48 h without feed) had recovery of Salmonella at 20 %. Salmonella<pathogen> recovery in pooled spleen samples did not appear associated with feeding treatments ( 22 % positive). The remaining pullets challenged with Campylobacter<pathogen> at 21 wk produced similar trends as was seen for Salmonella<pathogen> SAD program pullets had significantly higher Campylobacter<pathogen> from ceca ( 80 to 100 %) compared to pullets on EDL ( 30 to 60 %) or EDT ( 40 to 95 %). These results suggest that using a Skip-a-Day feeding program for broiler breeder pullets contributes to persistently higher Salmonella and Campylobacter<pathogen> ceca colonization and litter prevalence.
