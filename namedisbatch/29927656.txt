  Schools have long been critical partners for public health authorities in achieving widespread vaccination. In the mid-20th century , however , public schools also served as sites of large-scale experiments on novel vaccines. Through examining the experimental diphtheria<disease> , polio<disease> , and measles<pathogen> vaccine trials , I explored the implications of using schools in this manner , as well as the continuities and discontinuities among the three cases. Common to all of them was that the use of schools brought decision-making into the public sphere , subjecting parents to social pressures and the influences of school officials and community members. However , the effects of using schools varied as well , as their social and institutional significance interacted differently with the narratives surrounding each disease , the public 's changing perception of medicine and science , and society 's changing values. These insights show not only the power of public institutions to influence opinions and perceptions , but also the subtle forces that one 's authority figures , peers , and community members may bring to a seemingly private decision-making process. These considerations are relevant to health interventions today , such as the complex debate over community consent in global health research.
