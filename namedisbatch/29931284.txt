  Respiratory<pathogen> syncytial<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( RSV<pathogen>) is a leading cause of acute lower respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> ( ALRTI) in young children , but data on surveillance case definition performance in estimating burdens have been limited. We enrolled children aged < 5 years hospitalized for ALRTI ( or neonatal<disease> sepsis<disease> in young infants) through active prospective surveillance at 5 sentinel hospitals in South Africa and collected nasopharyngeal aspirates from them for RSV<pathogen> molecular diagnostic testing between 2009 and 2014. Clinical data were used to characterize RSV<pathogen> disease and retrospectively evaluate the performance of respiratory illness case definitions ( including the World Health Organization definition for severe<disease> acute<disease> respiratory<disease> infection<disease> ( SARI)) in identifying hospitalized children with laboratory-confirmed RSV<pathogen> according to age group ( < 3 , 3-5 , 6-11 , 12-23 , and 24-59 months). Of 9969 hospitalized children , 2723 ( 27 %) tested positive for RSV<pathogen>. Signs and symptoms in RSV-positive children varied according to age; fever<disease> was less likely to occur in children aged < 3 months ( 57 %; odds ratio ( OR) , 0.8 ( 95 % CI , 0.7-0.9)) but more likely in those aged â‰¥ 12 months ( 82 %; OR , 1.7-1.9) than RSV-negative children. The sensitivity ( range , 55 % -81 %) and specificity ( range , 27 % -54 %) of the SARI case definition to identify hospitalized RSV-positive children varied according to age; the lowest sensitivity was for infants aged < 6 months. Using SARI as the case definition would have missed 36 % of RSV-positive children aged < 5 years and 49 % of those aged < 3 months; removing the fever<disease> requirement from the definition recovered most missed cases. Including fever<disease> in the SARI case definition lowers the sensitivity for RSV<pathogen> case detection among young children hospitalized with an ALRTI and likely underestimates its burden.
