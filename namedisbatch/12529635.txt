  Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> can endure long periods of environmental stress by altering their development to execute a quiescent state called `` dauer ''. Previous work has implicated LKB1- the causative gene in the autosomal dominant , cancer pre-disposing disease called Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome<disease> ( PJS) , and its downstream target AMPK , in the establishment of germline stem cell ( GSC) quiescence during the dauer stage. Loss of function mutations in both LKB1/par -4 and AMPK/aak ( 0) result in untimely GSC proliferation during the onset of the dauer stage , although the molecular mechanism through which these factors regulate quiescence remains unclear. Curiously , the hyperplasia<disease> observed in par-4 mutants is more severe than AMPK-compromised dauer larvae , suggesting that par-4 has alternative downstream targets in addition to AMPK to regulate germline quiescence. We conducted three genome-wide RNAi screens to identify potential downstream targets of the protein kinases PAR-4 and AMPK that mediate dauer-dependent GSC quiescence. First , we screened to identify genes that phenocopy the par-4-dependent hyperplasia<disease> when compromised by RNAi. Two additional RNAi screens were performed to identify genes that suppressed the germline hyperplasia<disease> in par-4 and aak ( 0) dauer larvae , respectively. Interestingly , a subset of the candidates we identified are involved in the regulation of cell polarity and cytoskeletal function downstream of par-4 , in an AMPK-independent manner. Moreover , we show that par-4 temporally regulates actin cytoskeletal organization within the dauer germ line at the rachis-adjacent membrane , in an AMPK-independent manner. Our data suggest that the regulation of the cytoskeleton and cell polarity may contribute significantly to the tumour suppressor function of LKB1/par -4.
