  The protective role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi<pathogen> ( AMF) against the phytopathogen Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis ( Cmm) was examined in tomato plants. Seven different AMF isolates were used to determine which ones were able to induce effectively resistance against Cmm. Stems of seven-week tomato plants were infected with Cmm , then a disease severity index ( DSI) was determined during the next three weeks. In addition to different responses to mycorrhizal inoculation , three levels of responses to the bacterial<disease> disease<disease> were recognized in treatments. Plants inoculated with Rhizophagus irregularis<pathogen> ( Ri) showed both the highest colonization and the highest induced resistance to Cmm while the effect of Funneliformis mosseae , Gigaspora margarita and Claroideoglomus claroideum on mycorrhizal colonization and on the induced resistance were intermediate and high , respectively. Subsequently , Ri was chosen to inoculate ethylene-insensitive tomato mutant line Never ripe ( Nr) and its background ( Pearson) to investigate the possible role of ethylene ( ET) in the mycorrhiza-induced resistance ( MIR). The results showed that Ri could induce systemic resistance against Cmm in the Pearson background , whereas ET-insensitivity in Nr plants impaired MIR. These results suggest that ET is required for Ri-induced resistance against Cmm. To our knowledge , this is the first study to examine the effect of different AMF isolates on the response of tomato plants to Cmm and involvement of ET in MIR against Cmm.
