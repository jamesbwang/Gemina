  Geriatric syndromes<disease> , multimorbidity , and disability are prevalent among ageing population. However , no study empirically examined their additive or synergistic effect on healthcare use. The present study aims to estimate overlapping prevalence of geriatric syndromes<disease> , multimorbidity , and disability; and to examine associations of these three conditions with healthcare use. A cross-sectional study was conducted in community-dwelling older adults aged 60 and above in 12 Hong Kong districts. Pearson 's chi-squared test for trend was performed to examine prevalence of geriatric syndromes<disease> , multimorbidity , and disability across three age groups ( 60-69 , 70-79 , and â‰¥ 80). Multiple logistic regression was conducted to explore associations of these three conditions with three types<pathogen> of healthcare use ( hospital admission , general outpatient clinic and specialist outpatient clinic attendance) respectively. Among 2618 participants , 75.3 , 41.8 , and 22.5 % had geriatric syndromes<disease> , multimorbidity , and disability respectively , and 10.4 % had all the three conditions. Prevalence of the three conditions and their coexistence significantly increased with age ( p for trend < .001). Each condition was independently associated with at least two out of three types<pathogen> of healthcare use. Interestingly , the associations of multimorbidity and disability with specialist outpatient clinic attendance were weakened at older age , while the associations of geriatric syndromes<disease> with hospital admission and specialist outpatient clinic attendance were strengthened. Furthermore , the odds of all the three types<pathogen> of healthcare use increased with the number of conditions present ( p for trend < .001). Our findings support that the three conditions overlap and increase healthcare use. Early identification , prevention and intervention targeting older adults living with multiple healthcare needs are necessary.
