  Phylogeography places population genetics in an explicitly spatial context , and in doing so attempts to reconstruct the historical and contemporary evolutionary processes acting across a species range through space and time. Here we present the phylogeographical structure of Daphnia magna<pathogen> as determined for full mitochondrial genomes from samples of 60 populations throughout much of the species known range , including Europe , the Middle<pathogen> East , and Asia. Contrary to previous analyses , the present analysis of the mitochondrial genome reveals coarse-grained ( continental scale) evidence for spatial structure , and in particular a deep split between Western Eurasia and East Asian D. magna<pathogen> lineages. In contrast to previous analyses with nuclear genetic markers , our mitogenomic analysis reveals much less structure within lineages. We quantify divergence between species using the full mitochondrial genome sequence of a closely related species , D. similis<pathogen>. The distribution of European and Middle Eastern<disease> genetic diversity is consistent with a rapid demographic expansion following the end of the most recent ice age about 10,000 years before present. By estimating species wide distributions of d
