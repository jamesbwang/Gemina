  Murepavadin ( POL7080) represents the first member of a novel class of outer membrane protein-targeting antibiotics. Murepavadin acts by binding to LPS transport protein D and is being developed for the treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated<disease> pneumonia<disease> caused by Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of murepavadin against XDR P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen>. A total of 785 clinical isolates of XDR P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> were collected in 2016-17 through the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program from 34 medical centres in 21 European nations ( n = 353) and 75 medical centres in North<pathogen> America ( n = 432). Isolates were categorized as XDR when susceptible ( CLSI) to ≤ 2 of the following antimicrobial classes: antipseudomonal cephalosporins , carbapenems , broad-spectrum penicillin/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations , fluoroquinolones<disease> , aminoglycosides and polymyxins. Susceptibility testing was performed by the reference broth microdilution method and EUCAST and CLSI interpretative criteria were applied. Murepavadin ( MIC50/90 , 0.12/ 0.25 mg/L) inhibited 96.7 % of isolates at ≤ 0.5 mg/L and was 8-fold more active than colistin ( MIC50/90 , 1/2 mg/L). Only seven isolates ( 0.9 %) exhibited murepavadin MIC values > 4 mg/L. Colistin ( MIC50/90 , 1/2 mg/L; 93.6 % susceptible) was the most active comparator , followed by ceftolozane/tazobactam ( MIC50/90 , 2/ > 32 mg/L; 70.6 % susceptible) and tobramycin ( MIC50/90 , 8/ > 8 mg/L; 47.5 % susceptible). Murepavadin remained active against isolates that were non-susceptible to colistin ( n = 50; MIC50/90 , 0.25/ 0.25 mg/L) , ceftolozane/tazobactam ( n = 231; MIC50/90 , 0.12/ 0.25 mg/L) and/or tobramycin ( n = 412; MIC50/90 , 0.12/ 0.25 mg/L). Murepavadin exhibited potent activity against a large collection of clinical XDR P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> isolates from Europe and North<pathogen> America , including isolates that were non-susceptible to colistin , ceftolozane/tazobactam and/or tobramycin.
