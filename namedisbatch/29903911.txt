  The World Health Organization ( WHO) has reported a world-wide surge in cases of cholera<disease> caused by the intestinal pathogen Vibrio<pathogen> cholerae<pathogen> , and , combined , such surges have claimed several million lives , mostly in early childhood. Elevated cAMP production in intestinal epithelial cells challenged with cholera<disease> toxin ( CTX) results in diarrhea<disease> due to chloride transport by a cAMP-activated channel , the cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR). However , the identity of the main cAMP-producing proteins that regulate CFTR in the intestine and may be relevant for secretory diarrhea<disease> is unclear. Here , using RNA-Seq to identify the predominant AC isoform in mouse and human cells and extensive biochemical analyses for further characterization , we found that the cAMP-generating enzyme adenylate cyclase 6 ( AC6) physically and functionally associates with CFTR at the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells. We generated epithelium-specific AC6 knockout ( KO) mice and demonstrated that CFTR-dependent fluid secretion is nearly abolished in AC6-KO mice upon CTX challenge in ligated ileal loops. Furthermore , loss of AC6 function dramatically impaired CTX-induced CFTR activation in human and mouse intestinal spheroids. Our finding that the CFTR-AC6 protein complex is the key mediator of CTX-associated diarrhea<disease> may facilitate development of antidiarrheal agents to manage cholera<disease> symptoms and improve outcomes.
