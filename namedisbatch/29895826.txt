  Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> is a leading cause of mortality worldwide and establishes a long-lived latent infection in a substantial proportion of the human population. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that some individuals are resistant to latent M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> infection despite long-term and intense exposure , and we term these individuals ` resisters '. In this Review , we discuss the epidemiological and genetic data that support the existence of resisters and propose criteria to optimally define and characterize the resister phenotype. We review recent insights into the immune mechanisms of M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> clearance , including responses mediated by macrophages , T cells and B cells. Understanding the cellular mechanisms that underlie resistance to M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> infection may reveal immune correlates of protection that could be utilized for improved diagnostics , vaccine development and novel host-directed therapeutic strategies.
