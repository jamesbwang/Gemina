  Clostridium<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> is an important cause of nosocomial diarrhea<disease> in the western world. Toxins ( A , B , and binary toxins) generated by C difficile bacteria damage intestinal epithelial cells. Hallmarks of host response to C.<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> infection ( CDI) include upregulation of inflammatory mediators and tissue infiltration by immune cells. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF) is an inflammatory cytokine that is known to enhance the host immune response to infectious pathogens. Additionally , MIF can adversely impact host survival to numerous infections. The role of MIF in the pathogenesis of CDI remains poorly understood. Here , we show that patients with CDI had significantly higher circulating MIF compared to patients who had diarrhea<disease> but tested negative for C.<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> ( non-CDI controls). Similarly , in a mouse model , C.<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> challenge significantly increased levels of plasma and tissue MIF. Antibody-mediated depletion of MIF decreased C. difficile-induced inflammatory responses , clinical disease , and mortality. Together , these results uncover a potential role for MIF in exacerbating CDI and suggest that use of anti-MIF antibodies may represent a therapeutic strategy to curb host inflammatory responses and improve disease outcomes in CDI.
