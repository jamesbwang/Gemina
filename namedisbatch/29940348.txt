  Comprehensive epidemiological surveys for Lyme<disease> disease<disease> have not been conducted for the Bactrian camel in China. In this study , a total of 138 blood specimens collected from Bactrian camels from Zhangye City in Gansu Province and Yili and Aksu in Xinjiang Province , China , were examined for the presence of Borrelia<pathogen> spp.. Species-specificity nested PCR based on the 5S-23S rRNA , OspA , flaB and 16S rRNA genes revealed that the total positive rate of Borrelia<pathogen> spp. was 3.6 % ( 5/138 , 95 % CI = 0.2-17.9). These results were confirmed by sequence analysis of the positive PCR products or positive colonies. This is the first report of Borrelia<pathogen> pathogens in camels in China. Two Borrelia<pathogen> species that cause Lyme<disease> disease<disease> and one that causes relapsing fever<disease> were identified in the camel blood samples by sequencing. The findings of this study indicate that the Bactrian camel may serve as a potential natural host of Lyme<disease> disease<disease> and/or relapsing fever<disease> in China.
