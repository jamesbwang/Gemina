  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) has been reported to have a negative effect on bone mineral density ( BMD) in Asian populations. Whether such an association exists in Western populations is less clear. This cross-sectional analysis of data from NHANES III , a United States national health survey conducted from 1988 to 1994 , included 6089 participants aged 40-75 years , selected after excluding people with hepatitis<disease> virus<pathogen> serology , elevated alcohol consumption , decreased renal function , or steroid use , and pregnant females. The main outcome , BMD at the femoral neck , was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The primary exposure , NAFLD , was defined as moderate or severe hepatic steatosis diagnosed using abdominal ultrasonography. After controlling for gender and menopausal status , race/ethnicity , age and body mass index , NAFLD was not significantly associated with BMD ( beta coefficient: -0.006 , 95 % CI: -0.016 , 0.003). A secondary analysis categorized participants with NAFLD according to their serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) levels into high and normal ALT NAFLD groups , and compared these with the non-NAFLD group. NAFLD with higher levels of ALT was associated with lower levels of BMD ( beta coefficient: -0.023 , 95 % CI: -0.044 , -0.002). This study showed a relationship between NAFLD with high ALT and lower BMD in the general U.S. population.
