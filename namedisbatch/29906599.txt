  To evaluate the ability of the BioFire FilmArray Blood Culture Identification ( BCID) panel to rapidly detect pathogens producing late-onset ventilator-associated<disease> pneumonia<disease> ( VAP) , a severe infection often produced by Gram-negative bacteria. These microorganisms are frequently multidrug resistant and typically require broad-spectrum empiric treatment. In the context of an international multicentre clinical trial ( MagicBullet) , respiratory samples were collected at the time of suspicion of VAP from 165 patients in 32 participating hospitals in Spain , Greece and Italy. Microorganisms were identified using the BCID panel and compared with results obtained by conventional microbiologic techniques. Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> , Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii and Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> were the most commonly identified species , representing 54.7 % ( 70/128) of microorganisms. The BCID panel showed high global specificity ( 98.1 %; 95 % confidence interval , 96-100) and negative predictive values ( 96.6 %) and a global sensitivity and positive predictive value of 78.6 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 70-88) and 87.3 % , respectively , for these microorganisms. Importantly , the BCID panel provided results in only 1 hour directly from respiratory samples with minimal sample processing times. The BCID panel may have clinical utility in rapidly ruling out microorganisms causing VAP , specifically multidrug-resistant Gram-negative species. This could facilitate the optimization of empiric treatment.
