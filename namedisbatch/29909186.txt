  HIV-associated motor neuron disease ( MND) , or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS)- like syndrome<disease> associated with HIV<pathogen> infection , is a rare manifestation of HIV<pathogen> infection. HIV-associated MND has only been identified in few cases to date. We analysed two Brazilian patients with HIV<pathogen> infection who developed MND. The diagnosis of HIV<pathogen> infection was concomitant with diagnosis of MND in one patient and it occurred eight years before the MND symptoms in another patient. The manifestation of MND in our patients with HIV<pathogen> infection was similar to classic ALS. The antiretroviral therapy improves their HIV<pathogen> infection. However , slow progression of MND occurred in the two patients despite their antiretroviral therapy or HIV<pathogen> viral load ( undetectable). We revised the international literature ( PubMed database) of the patients reported with MND and HIV<pathogen> infection.
