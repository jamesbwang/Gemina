  Use of highly active antiretroviral therapy has led to marked reductions in the incidence of HIV-associated opportunistic infections but has had comparatively less impact on the incidence of some pulmonary diseases. This study was done to determine the pulmonary conditions leading to hospital admissions in people living with HIV/AIDS at two central hospitals in Zimbabwe and the pulmonary rehabilitation intervention received. A total of 92 participants were recruited of which 60 ( 65.2 %) were females. The mean age of the participants was 41.3 years ( SD = 9.1). The most common pulmonary condition leading to hospital admission was tuberculosis<disease> in 53 ( 57.6 %). About 52 ( 56.6 %) of the participants suffered from pulmonary complications in the last 6 months , 48 ( 92.3 %) were admitted and 26 ( 50.0 %) of the participants received physiotherapy treatment during their admission. None of the participants indicated that they once attended an outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation clinic. Respiratory complication is one of the leading causes of morbidity associated with HIV<pathogen> but no pulmonary rehabilitation services are being offered to these patients. There is need for introduction of pulmonary rehabilitation programs for people living with HIV/AIDS in the current setting.
