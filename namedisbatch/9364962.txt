  Leishmaniasis<disease> is an emerging disease in Thailand with an unknown incidence or prevalence. Although the number of properly characterized and clinically confirmed cases is about 20 , it is suspected that this low number masks a potentially high prevalence , with clinical disease typically manifesting itself against an immunocompromised background , but with a substantial number of subclinical or cured cases of infection. To date leishmaniasis<disease> in Thailand has been mainly ascribed to two taxa within the recently erected subgenus Mundinia Shaw , Camargo & Teixeira , 2016 , Leishmania ( Mundinia) martiniquensis Desbois , Pratlong & Dedet , 2014 and a species that has not been formally described prior to this study. A case of simple cutaneous leishmaniasis<disease> was diagnosed in a patient from Nan Province , Thailand. Molecular analysis of parasites derived from a biopsy sample revealed this to be a new species of Leishmania Ross , 1908 , which has been named as Leishmania ( Mundinia) orientalis<pathogen> Bates & Jariyapan n. sp.. A formal description is provided , and this new taxon supercedes some isolates from the invalid taxon `` Leishmania<pathogen> siamensis ''. A summary of all known cases of leishmaniasis<disease> with a corrected species identification is provided. Three species of parasites are now known to cause leishmaniasis<disease> is Thailand , L. martiniquensis and L. orientalis<pathogen> n. sp. in the subgenus Mundinia , which contains the type-species Leishmania enriettii Muniz & Medina , 1948 , and a single case of Leishmania<pathogen> infantum Nicolle , 1908. This study now enables epidemiological and other investigations into the biology of these unusual parasites to be conducted. It is recommended that the use of the taxonomically invalid name `` L. siamensis '' should be discontinued.
