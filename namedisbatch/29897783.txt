  Poultry are the main reservoir for thermophilic Campylobacter<pathogen> spp. , which is the most common causative agent of human bacterial gastroenteritis<disease> The epidemiology of Campylobacter<pathogen> in poultry , particularly in turkeys , is not completely understood. This study aimed at identifying potential sources and transmission routes of thermophilic Campylobacter<pathogen> spp. in commercial turkey farms. C.<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen> and C coli isolates from breeders ( n = 29 , 20 C.<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen> and 9 C.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>) and their progeny ( n = 51 , 18 C.<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen> and 33 C.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>) reared in two different farms for three sequential production cycles were analysed by multilocus sequence typing ( MLST). Strains ( n = 88 , 42 C.<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen> and 46 C.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>) isolated from environmental ( i.e. anteroom and in-house overshoes) , water ( i.e. drinkers and water line) , and pest ( i.e. flies , Alphitobius diaperinus , and mice) sources were also examined. MLST of C.<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen> and C.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolates resulted in 13 and 12 different sequence types ( STs) belonging to six and one previously-described clonal complexes ( CCs) , respectively. Three novel STs were identified. Genetic similarities were detected between isolates from fattening turkeys and the considered environmental , water , and pest sources , and with the breeders to a lesser extent. Source attribution analysis estimated that environmental and water sources accounted for most ( ∼ 75 %) of fattening turkey isolates and were therefore identified as the most likely sources of flock colonization , followed by pests ( ∼ 20 %) and breeders ( ∼ 5 %). These sources may thus be targeted by control measures to mitigate the risk of Campylobacter<pathogen> colonization in commercial turkeys. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS High occurrence of C.<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen> and C.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> in commercial turkey flocks. High genetic diversity of C.<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen> and C.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> in commercial turkey flocks. Horizontal transmission responsible for Campylobacter<pathogen> colonization of commercial turkey flocks. Environmental and water sources involved in Campylobacter<pathogen> colonization of commercial turkey flocks. Strategies for prevention and control of Campylobacter<pathogen> colonization of commercial turkey flocks are needed.
