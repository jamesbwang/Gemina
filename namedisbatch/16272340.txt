  Immune responses are a double-edged sword. Effective and appropriate immune responses capable of controlling viral<disease> infection<disease> while also largely preserving tissue integrity , are critical for host survival. Too strong immune responses might result in immune pathology , while too weak immune responses might cause viral persistence. Physiologic ageing is accompanied with a decline in the normal functioning of the immune system , which is termed as `` immunosenescence ''. We show that aged mice ( 16-19 months old) are more resistant to influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( IAV<pathogen>) infection than the young mice. Strong immune responses in the young mice after IAV<pathogen> infection result in faster clearance of virus , but also cause severe lung injury and higher mortality rate. While in the aged mice , the delayed and milder immune responses contribute to reduced pulmonary damage , and are still capable to clear the infection even with a slower kinetics , displaying a more resistant phenotype during IAV<pathogen> infection. Hence , our work demonstrates that moderate immune responses as a decline with ageing in the aged mice balance the immune pathology and viral clearance , might be beneficial for the host during certain circumstances. Our results provide important insight to our basic knowledge of immunosenescence and immune defenses to invading pathogens. Further , our results indicate that age factors should be considered when investigating the vaccination and therapeutic strategies for severe IAV<pathogen> infection.
