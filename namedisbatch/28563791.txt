  Mauritania is one of the African countries with ongoing malaria<disease> transmission where data on insecticide resistance of local malaria<disease> vectors are limited despite an increasing use of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets ( LLINs) as the main intervention for vector control. This study presents an evaluation of the level of insecticide resistance of Anopheles<pathogen> arabiensis in Nouakchott. Anopheles<pathogen> gambiae<pathogen> ( s.l.) larvae<pathogen> were collected in breeding sites during the rainy season ( August-September) in 2015 and 2016 from two selected sites in Nouakchott and reared until emergence. Adult anopheline mosquitoes were tested against malathion ( 5 %) , bendiocarb ( 0.1 %) , permethrin ( 0.75 %) and deltamethrin ( 0.05 %) using standard World Health Organization ( WHO) insecticide-impregnated papers. PCR assays were used for the identification of An. gambiae<pathogen> ( s.l.) sibling species as well as knockdown resistance ( kdr). The mean knockdown times 50 % ( KDT The study showed high levels of pyrethroid resistance in An. arabiensis populations in Nouakchott and presence of both West<disease> and East African kdr alleles in the resistant phenotype. These results highlight a need for routine monitoring of susceptibility of malaria<disease> vector populations to insecticides used in public health programs.
