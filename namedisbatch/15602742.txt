  To determine the distribution of important mutations of the `` a '' determinant region in the HBV genome among patients in different clinical phases of HBV infection. Variations in Hepatitis<disease> B<disease> infection not only change the outcome of the disease but also the symptoms from which the chronic HBV patients are suffering. We have meticulously selected a total of 40 chronic HBV patients from four different subclasses of chronic HBV<pathogen> clinical phases including immune tolerant ( IT) , immune active ( IA) , inactive carrier ( IC) and hepatitis<disease> B<disease> e antigen ( HBeAg)- negative ( ENEG); 10 samples per each phase. Mutations of the `` a '' determinant region were identified using PCR-Direct sequencing method. 17 amino-acid substitutions at 12 positions inside the `` a '' determinant were identified in all forty samples; 3 mutations in the IT group , 6 mutations in the IA phase , 3 mutations in the IC patients and 5 mutations in the ENEG phase. Different substitutions were observed in all four clinical phases. The IA phase was the most variant group with the highest number of amino-acid substitutions. These results did not reveal a strong pattern to distinguish different clinical phases of Chronic HBV<pathogen> infection , but there are some obvious differences regarding the number and position of mutations between these four clinical phases.
