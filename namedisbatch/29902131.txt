  In contrast to broad range expansion through translocations , many mountain<disease> goat ( Oreamnos americanus) populations have shown signs of decline. Recent documentation of pneumonia<disease> in mountain<disease> goats highlights their susceptibility to bacterial pathogens typically associated with bighorn sheep ( Ovis canadensis<pathogen>) epizootics. Respiratory pathogen communities of mountain<disease> goats are poorly characterized yet have important implications for management and conservation of both species. We characterized resident pathogen communities across a range of mountain<disease> goat populations as an initial step to inform management efforts. Between 2010 and 2017 , we sampled 98 individuals within three regions of the Greater Yellowstone Area ( GYA) , with a smaller sampling effort in southeast Alaska , USA. Within the GYA , we detected Mycoplasma<pathogen> ovipneumoniae in two regions and we found at least two Pasteurellaceae species in animals from all regions. Mannheimia<pathogen> haemolytica<pathogen> was the only pathogen that we detected in southeast Alaska. Given the difficult sampling conditions , limited sample size , and imperfect detection , our failure to detect specific pathogens should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless , respiratory pathogens within the GYA may be an important , yet underappreciated , cause of mountain<disease> goat mortality. Moreover , because of the strong niche overlap of bighorn sheep and mountain<disease> goats , interspecific transmission is an important concern for managers restoring or introducing mountain<disease> ungulates within sympatric ranges.
