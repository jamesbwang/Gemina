  German data regarding the burden of complications from chronic hepatitis<disease> C<disease> ( CHC) virus<pathogen> infection are limited. To address this issue , this study evaluates the clinical and economic burden of hepatic and extrahepatic complications ( EHCs) associated with CHC in Germany. This retrospective , cross-sectional study used claims data from the Betriebskrankenkasse German sickness fund ( 2007-2014) to assess the risks and medical costs of hepatic complications and EHCs , including conditions that are prevalent and behavioral factors associated with CHC. Prevalence , incidence , and risks were calculated for 1:1 matched patients with and without CHC ( n = 3994). All-cause cost , medical costs related to hepatic and EHCs , as well as CHC-related and non-CHC-related pharmacy costs ( adjusted to the 2016 Euro rate) , were calculated and compared between 1:5 matched patients with ( n = 8425) and without CHC ( n = 42,125). Patients with CHC had a 3-fold higher risk for any EHC ( OR = 3.0; P < 0.05) and higher EHC-related medical costs ( adjusted difference , $ 1606; P < 0.01) compared with patients without CHC. Total costs ( $ 10,108 vs. $ 5430) , hepatic complication-related medical costs ( $ 1425 vs. $ 556) , EHC-related costs ( $ 3547 vs. $ 1921) , CHC-related pharmacy costs ( $ 577 vs. $ 116) , and non-CHC-related pharmacy costs ( $ 3719 vs. $ 1479) were all significantly greater for patients with CHC compared with patients without CHC. EHC-related medical costs were a major contributor to the higher all-cause medical ( 84.4 %) and total ( 44.3 %) cost differences between patients with CHC and the matched sample of patients without CHC. CHC is associated with substantial clinical and economic burden in Germany , largely due to hepatic complications and EHCs. Abbvie Inc..
