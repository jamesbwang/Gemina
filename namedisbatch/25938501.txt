  Community health screenings in KwaZulu-Natal Province , South Africa. To study the synergism between diabetes mellitus ( DM) and human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) infection in increasing the risk of tuberculosis<disease> ( TB). In this cross-sectional study , we analyzed data from two community health projects , one at congregate settings , and one at household settings ( n = 7708) , in a rural resource-limited region where integrated communicable and non-communicable disease screening services were offered. Odds ratios ( ORs) for demographic factors , socio-economic factors , DM status , and HIV<pathogen> positivity were calculated using multivariate analysis , and the statistical interaction between HIV<pathogen> and DM was tested. The primary outcome was the presence of TB symptoms. Among 7708 individuals , age > 65 years ( OR 1.72 , 95 % CI 1.47-2.02) , HIV<pathogen> infection ( OR 1.66 , 95 % CI 1.40-1.97) and DM ( OR 1.36 , 95 % CI 1.11-1.67) were independently associated with increased odds of TB symptoms. Receiving monthly grants ( OR 0.78 , 95 % CI 0.66-0.91) , access to a toilet ( OR 0.54 , 95 % CI 0.35-0.83) , and access to solar or electric energy ( OR 0.86 , 95 % CI 0.77-0.97) reduced the odds. There was evidence of significant interaction between DM and HIV<pathogen> on the multiplicative scale. DM and HIV<pathogen> synergistically increased the odds of TB symptoms according to these retrospective data. Future studies should prospectively evaluate synergism between HIV<pathogen> and DM in increasing the risk of active TB.
