  To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of tetracycline vs. high-dose amoxicillin in bismuth-based quadruple therapy for Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori ( H pylori) eradication. This randomized , open-label clinical trial included 228 patients with H.pylori infection and duodenal ulcer<disease> without a history of H.pylori treatment. Patients were randomly divided into two groups. The amoxicillin group received metronidazole 500 mg , bismuth subcitrate 240 mg , and amoxicillin 1000 mg , all three times a day , plus omeprazole 20 mg twice a day , for 14 days. The tetracycline group received metronidazole 500 mg three times a day; bismuth subcitrate240mg and tetracycline HCl 500 mg , both four times a day; and omeprazole 20 mg twice a day , for 14 days. Evaluation for compliance and drug-relatedadverse effects were evaluated at the end of two weeks. Eight weeks after the end of treatment , the rate of H.pylori eradication was assessed by the C13urease breath test. There were no significant demographic differences between the two groups. Eradication rate was higher with the amoxicillin-containing regimen than the tetracycline-containing regimen: 105/110 ( 95.51 %; 95 % confidence interval , 91.5 % -99.3 %) vs. 88/105 ( 83.8 %; 95 % CI , 76.7 % -90.8 %) by per-protocol analysis ( p = 0.005) and 92.9 % ( 95 % CI , 88.1 % -97.6 %) vs. 76.5 % ( 95 % CI , 68.7 % -84.2 %) by intention-to-treat analysis ( ITT , p = 0.001). Adverse effects were significant higher in the tetracycline groupthan in the amoxicillin group ( 65.2 % vs. 43.4 %; p = 0.001). Bismuth-based quadruple therapy including high-dose amoxicillin and metronidazole achieved an acceptable rate of H.pylori infection eradication with good tolerance in patients with duodenal ulcer<disease>. This regimen can overcome treatment resistance in areas with high prevalence of metronidazole and clarithromycin resistance. The Thai Clinical Trial Registry ( TCTR) 20170623004.
