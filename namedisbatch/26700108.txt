  Improved understanding of pathogen survival in the stream environment is needed to enhance existing predictive models of stream pathogen populations. Further , the increasing use of thermal springs for bathing necessitates additional studies focused on not only typical streams but also thermal spring conditions , where water temperature is relatively higher than typical streams. This study was conducted to assess the survival of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 and Salmonella<disease> Typhimurium<pathogen> in stream water under free floating and particle-attached conditions at a range of temperature. A series of microcosm studies were conducted to determine pathogen decay rates. In bench-scale experiments , water circulation and sediment resuspension mimicked natural stream and thermal spring conditions , with continuous air flow providing aeration , constant mixing and turbulent conditions , and improved water circulation. Data on E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 and Salmonella<pathogen> survival were subsequently used to determine first-order decay equations for calculating the rate constant and decimal reduction time for the modeled experimental conditions. Results showed that at 40 째C , the survival of particle attached E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 was longer than that of particle attached Salmonella<pathogen> Under free floating condition , Salmonella survived longer than E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7. At 50 째C , survival of particle attached E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 and Salmonella was longer than that of free floating E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and Salmonella. At 60 째C , survival of particle attached Salmonella was longer than that of free floating Salmonella<pathogen> Similarly at 60 째C , the survival of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 under particle attached condition was longer than that of the free floating condition. The findings of this study suggest that the survival of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 differs than the survival of Salmonella<pathogen> in stream water and thermal spring conditions , and the assumption used in previous studies to estimate survival of bacteria in stream environment could result in over/underestimation if the impact of particle attachment on pathogen survival is not accounted for.
