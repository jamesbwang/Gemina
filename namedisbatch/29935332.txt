  The draft genome sequences of two Enterobacter<pathogen> aerogenes strains ( HN503E2II and PN108E5IIB) isolated from two Cameroonian abattoirs are reported. Bacterial genomic DNA of the two isolates was sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform. Generated reads were de novo assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench and SPAdes. The assembled contigs were annotated , and antibiotic resistance genes , virulence factors and plasmids were identified. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that both strains were similar , with genomes of 4878638bp and 4794257bp , encoding several resistance genes associated with resistance to Î²-lactams , fluoroquinolones<disease> , aminoglycosides , fosfomycin , phenicols , sulphonamides , trimethoprim , macrolides and tetracycline. In silico analysis also revealed chromosomal integration of one plasmid in the genome of PN108E5IIB. The genome sequences reported here will provide useful information for a better understanding of the genetic structure of E. aerogenes<pathogen> in Africa.
