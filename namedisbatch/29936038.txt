  Plasmodium<pathogen> vivax<pathogen> resistance to chloroquine ( CQ) was first reported over 60 years ago. Here we analyzed sequence variations in the multidrug resistance 1 gene ( Pvmdr1) , a putative molecular marker for P.<pathogen> vivax<disease> CQ resistance , in field isolates collected from three sites in Thailand during 2013-2016. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms previously implicated in reduced CQ sensitivity were found. These genetic variations encode amino acids in the two nucleotide-binding domains as well as the transmembrane domains of the protein. The high level of genetic diversity of Pvmdr1 provides insights into the evolutionary history of this gene. Specifically , there was little evidence of positive selection at amino acid F1076L in global isolates to be promoted as a possible marker for CQ resistance. Population genetic analysis clearly divided the parasites into eastern and western populations , which is consistent with their geographical separation by the central malaria-free area of Thailand. With CQ-primaquine remaining as the frontline treatment for vivax<disease> malaria<disease> in all regions of Thailand , such a population subdivision could be shaped and affected by the current drugs for P.<pathogen> falciparum<disease> since mixed P. falciparum/P. vivax<disease> infections often occur in this region.
