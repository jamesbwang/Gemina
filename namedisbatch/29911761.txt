  Increasing antibiotic resistance in the community results in greater use of empiric broad spectrum antibiotics for patients at hospital admission. As a measure of antibiotic stewardship it is important to identify a patient population that can receive narrow spectrum antibiotics. To evaluate resistance patterns of Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> bloodstream infection ( BSI) from strictly community-acquired infection and the impact of recent antibiotic use on this resistance. This single center , historical cohort study of adult patients with E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> BSI was conducted from January 2007 to December 2011. Patients had no exposure to any healthcare facility and no chronic catheters or chronic ulcers<disease>. Data on antibiotic use during the previous 90 days was collected and relation to resistance patterns was assessed. Of the total number of patients , 267 BSI cases met the entry criteria; 153 patients ( 57 %) had bacteria sensitive to all antibiotics. Among 189 patients with no antibiotic exposure , 61 % of isolates ( 116) were pan-sensitive. Resistance to any antibiotic appeared in 114 patients and 12 were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL) producers. Quinolone use was the main driver of resistance to any antibiotic and to ESBL resistance patterns. In a multivariate analysis , older age ( odds ratio 1.1) and quinolone use ( odds ratio 7) were independently correlated to ESBL. At admission , stratification by patient characteristics and recent antibiotic use can help personalize primary empirical therapy.
