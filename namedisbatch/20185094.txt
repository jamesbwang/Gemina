  The viral load ( VL) in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy ( ART) is the best predictor of treatment outcome. The anticipated benefits of VL monitoring depend on the actual uptake of VL test results for clinical decisions. The objective of this study was to assess the uptake and utilization of VL test results for clinical decisions on HIV<pathogen> treatment in Cameroon , from 2013 to 2017. This was a retrospective cohort analysis of data from files of patients receiving ART at Buea , Limbe , Bamenda and Bafoussam regional hospital HIV<pathogen> treatment centers. A simple random pick of six file blocks was performed in each shelf that corresponded to a year of initiation , and the contents of all selected files were reviewed and the information needed for the study entered a structured questionnaire. The data collected was recorded in Epi Info ( version 7.1.5.2) , and analyzed using SATA ( version 12.1; StataCorp LP). Eight hundred and thirty files were reviewed. The mean duration on ART was 39.4 ± 12 months. Viral load testing uptake was 24.33 % and only one VL test had been done by all patients. Approximately 65 % of the patients did the first VL after more than 24 months on ART. The median turnaround ( TAT) time for VL testing was 6 days ( Interquartile range ( IQR) 3-7days). Among 201 patients who did a VL test , 94.55 % had VL suppression ( ≤ 1000copies/mm3). Approximately 54 % of the patients with virologic failure were switched to a second-line regimen. The uptake of viral load testing is low in North West , South West and West<disease> Regions of Cameroon. The current TAT for VL testing is plausible. The rate of switch to second line regimen is low. It is time to strengthen the scale up of VL testing and improve the rate of switch to second-line regimen in Cameroon.
