  Streptococcus<pathogen> infantarius<pathogen> subsp. infantarius<pathogen> ( Sii) , a member of the Streptococcus<pathogen> bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex ( SBSEC) , predominates as dairy-adapted and non-adapted variants in fermented dairy products ( FDP) in East and West Africa. Epidemiologic data suggest an association with colorectal cancer for most SBSEC members , including Sii from Kenyan patients. Phylogenetic relationships of East African human ( EAH) isolates to those of dairy and pathogenic origin were analysed to better estimate potential health implications via FDP consumption. The MLST-derived population structure was also evaluated to provide host , disease , geography and dairy adaptation associations for 157 SBSEC isolates , including 83 novel Sii/SBSEC isolates of which 40 originated from Kenyan colonoscopy patients. Clonal complex ( CC) 90 was delineated as potential pathogenic CC for Sii. Single EAH , West<disease> African dairy ( WAD) , food and animal Sii isolates clustered within CC-90 , suggesting a potential link to pathogenic traits for CC-90. The majority of EAH and WAD Sii were clustered in a shared clade distinct from CC-90 and East African dairy ( EAD) isolates. This indicates shared ancestry for the EAH and WAD clade and limitations to translate disease associations of EAH and CC-90 to EAD Sii , which could support the separation of pathogenic , pathobiont/commensal and food lineages.
