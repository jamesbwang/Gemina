  Three cases of the avian influenza<disease> A<pathogen> ( H9N2<pathogen>) virus<pathogen> have been documented in Changsha , which is a large city that has nine districts and a population of 7.04 million in central South China. Among these patients , one was a girl and two were boys. The ages of the patients were 9 months , 2 years , and 15 years. Two cases of H9N2<pathogen> were detected in September , 2015 and one was detected in 2017. Two patients were children who had not reached the age for kindergarten and one was a student. These three cases were all mild and were detected in a sentinel hospital of the Chinese Influenza<disease> Surveillance System. We describe the clinical and epidemiological features of the youngest patient with H9N2<pathogen> in 2017 and the surveillance results of the H9N2<pathogen> virus in live poultry markets in Changsha. From January 2014 to December 2017 , 4212 samples were collected in live poultry markets in Changsha , among which 25.81 % ( 1087/4212) were H9N2-positive. Public health concerns should be addressed for emerging H9N2<pathogen> virus infection , and more strategies should be performed before this virus mutates to be more transmissible and highly pathogenic.
