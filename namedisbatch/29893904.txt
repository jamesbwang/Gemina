  Lyme<disease> borreliosis is caused by certain genospecies of the Borrelia<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> sensu lato complex , which are transmitted by hard ticks of the genus Ixodes<pathogen> The most common clinical manifestation is erythema migrans , an expanding skin redness that usually develops at the site of a tick bite and eventually resolves even without antibiotic treatment. The infecting pathogens can spread to other tissues and organs , resulting in manifestations that can involve the nervous system , joints , heart and skin. Fatal outcome is extremely rare and is due to severe heart involvement; fetal involvement is not reliably ascertained. Laboratory support-mainly by serology-is essential for diagnosis , except in the case of typical erythema migrans. Treatment is usually with antibiotics for 2 to 4 weeks; most patients recover uneventfully. There is no convincing evidence for antibiotic treatment longer than 4 weeks and there is no reliable evidence for survival of borreliae in adequately treated patients. European Lyme<disease> borreliosis is a frequent disease with increasing incidence. However , numerous scientifically questionable ideas on its clinical presentation , diagnosis and treatment may confuse physicians and lay people. Since diagnosis of Lyme<disease> borreliosis should be based on appropriate clinical signs , solid knowledge of clinical manifestations is essential.
