  Limited efficacy of current antivirals and antiviral-resistant mutations impairs anti-influenza treatment. Here , we evaluate the in vitro and in vivo antiviral effect of three defective interfering genes ( DIG-3) of influenza<disease> virus<pathogen>. Viral replication is significantly reduced in cell lines transfected with DIG-3. Mice treated with DIG-3 encoded by jetPEI-vector , as prophylaxis and therapeutics against A ( H7N7<pathogen>) virus<pathogen> , respectively , have significantly better survivals ( 80 % and 50 %) than control mice ( 0 %). We further develop a dual-functional peptide TAT-P1 , which delivers DIG-3 with high efficiency and concomitantly exerts antiviral activity by preventing endosomal acidification. TAT-P1/ DIG-3 is more effective than jetPEI/DIG -3 in treating A ( H7N7<pathogen>) or A ( H1N1<pathogen>) pdm09-infected mice and shows potent prophylactic protection on A ( H7N7<pathogen>) or A ( H1N1<pathogen>) pdm09-infected mice. The addition of P1 peptide , which prevents endosomal acidification , can enhance the protection of TAT-P1/ DIG-3 on A ( H1N1<pathogen>) pdm09-infected mice. Dual-functional TAT-P1 with DIG-3 can effectively protect or treat mice infected by avian and seasonal
