  Pulmonary hypertension ( PH) has been observed in up to 75 % of infants with moderate to severe<disease> respiratory<disease> syncytial<disease> virus<pathogen> ( RSV<pathogen>) bronchiolitis<disease> and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in infants with congenital heart disease. The purpose of this study was to establish a mouse model of PH secondary to RSV<pathogen> bronchiolitis<disease> that mimics the disease etiology as it occurs in infants. Neonatal mice were infected with RSV<pathogen> at 5 days of age , and then re-infected 4 weeks later. Serum free medium was administered to age-matched mice as control. Echocardiography and right ventricular systolic pressure ( RVSP) measurement via right jugular vein catheterization were conducted 5 and 6 days after the second infection , respectively. Peripheral capillary oxygen saturation ( SpO2) monitoring did not indicate hypoxia at 2-4 days post-RSV infection , before reinfection , and at 2-7 days after reinfection. RSV<pathogen> infected mice had a significantly higher RVSP than the controls. Pulsed wave Doppler recording of the pulmonary blood flow by echocardiogram demonstrated significantly shortened pulmonary artery acceleration time ( PAAT) and decreased PAAT/ejection time ratio in RSV<pathogen> infected mice. Morphometry showed that RSV<pathogen> infected mice exhibited a significantly higher pulmonary artery medial wall thickness and had an increased number of muscularized pulmonary arteries compared to the control. These findings , confirmed by RVSP measurements , demonstrate the development of PH in the lungs of mice infected with RSV<pathogen> as neonates. This animal model can be used to study the pathogenesis of PH secondary to RSV<pathogen> bronchiolitis<disease> , and to assess the effect of treatment interventions.
