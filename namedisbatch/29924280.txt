  Urinary<disease> infections<disease> are caused mainly by Escherichia<pathogen> coli ( E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>); indiscriminate use of antibiotics has caused an increase in infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL)- producing strains. Aiming to determine the sensitivity to fosfomycin , a study was conducted in ESBL-producing E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strains isolated from urine cultures at a hospital in Peru. Two hundred and sixty-six ( 266) strains of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> were collected , which were determined by conventional methods to be ESBL- producing. Sensitivity to fosfomycin was determined through minimum inhibitory concentration with the agar dilution method and the diffusion disc method. One hundred and ninety-two ( 192) ( 72.2 %) strains of ESBL-producing E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strains sensitive to Fosfomycin were found. It , therefore , follows that fosfomycin exhibits antimicrobial activity against ESBL-producing E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strains and that it could be considered a good treatment option for resistant strains.
