  In South America , wild populations of peccaries coexist with domestic and feral pigs , with poorly understood consequences. We captured 58 collared peccaries ( Pecari tajacu) and 15 feral pigs ( Sus scrofa) in locations of Colombia where coexistence of these species is known. Blood samples were tested for antibodies against four viral<disease> agents<disease> , classical swine fever<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( CSFV) , Aujeszky 's disease<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ADV) , porcine circovirus ( PCV-2) , and vesicular stomatitis virus ( New Jersey and Indiana subtypes) and two bacterial agents , Brucella spp. and six serovars of Leptospira<pathogen> interrogans<pathogen> The prevalence of CSFV was 5 % ( 3/58) in collared peccaries and 7 % ( 1/15) in feral pigs. The prevalence of PCV-2 was 7 % ( 1/15) in collared peccaries and 67 % ( 2/3) in feral pigs. Vesicular stomatitis prevalence was 33 % ( 8/24) in collared peccaries and 67 % ( 4/6) in feral pigs. Leptospira<pathogen> prevalence was 78 % ( 39/50) in collared peccary and 100 % ( 8/8) in feral pigs; bratislava , grippotyphosa , icterohaemorrhagiae , and pomona were the most frequent serovars. Also , the only white-lipped peccary ( Tayassu pecari) sampled was positive for L.<pathogen> interrogans<pathogen> serovar bratislava and for vesicular stomatitis virus , New Jersey strain. No samples were positive for ADV or Brucella. The seroprevalence of antibodies against L.<pathogen> interrogans<pathogen> was similar to that observed in other studies. Icterohaemorrhagiae appears to be a common serovar<pathogen> among in situ and ex situ peccary populations. Positive antibodies against PVC-2 represent a novel report of exposure to this pathogen in Colombian peccaries. Our results indicate the possible transmission of various pathogens , important for pig farms , in the studied pig and peccaries.
