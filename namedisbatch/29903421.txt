  Data are limited on risk factors for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus<pathogen> ( VRE) bacteremia. All patients with a confirmed VRE bacteremia in Ontario , Canada , between January 2009 and December 2013 were linked to provincial healthcare administrative data sources and frequency matched to 3 controls based on age , sex , and aggregated diagnosis group. Associations between predictors and VRE bacteremia were estimated by generalized estimating equations and summarized using odds ratios ( ORs) and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). In total , 217 cases and 651 controls were examined. In adjusted analyses , patient-level predictors included bone<disease> marrow transplant ( OR 106.99 ( 95 % CI 12.19-939.26)); solid organ transplant ( OR 17.17 ( 95 % CI 4.95-59.54)); any cancer ( OR 8.64 ( 95 % CI 3.88-19.21)); intensive care unit ( ICU) admission ( OR 6.81 ( 95 % CI 3.53-13.13)); heart disease ( OR 5.27 ( 95 % CI 2.00-13.90)); and longer length of stay ( OR 1.07 per day ( 95 % CI 1.06-1.09)). Hospital-level predictors included hospital size ( per increase in 100 beds ( OR 1.26 ( 95 % CI 1.07-1.48)) and teaching hospitals ( OR 3.87 ( 95 % CI 1.85-8.08)). Patients with a bone<disease> marrow transplant , solid organ transplant , cancer , or who are admitted to the ICU are at highest risk of VRE bacteremia , particularly at large hospitals and teaching hospitals.
