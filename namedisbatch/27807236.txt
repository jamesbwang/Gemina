  Herpesvirus<pathogen> latency has been difficult to understand molecularly due to low levels of viral genomes and gene expression. In the case of the betaherpesvirus<pathogen> human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV) , this is further complicated by the heterogeneity inherent to hematopoietic subpopulations harboring genomes and , as a consequence , the various patterns of infection that simultaneously exist in a host , ranging from latent to lytic. Single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq) provides tremendous potential in measuring the gene expression profiles of heterogeneous cell populations for a wide range of applications , including in studies of cancer , immunology , and infectious<disease> disease<disease>. A recent study by Shnayder et al. ( mBio 9: e00013-18 , 2018 , https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00013-18) utilized scRNA-seq to define transcriptomal characteristics of HCMV latency. They conclude that latency-associated gene expression is similar to the late lytic viral program but at lower levels of expression. The study highlights the numerous challenges , from the definition of latency to the analysis of scRNA-seq , that exist in defining a latent transcriptome.
