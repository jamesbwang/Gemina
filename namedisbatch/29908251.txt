  Data on the management and outcomes of Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> bacteraemia<disease> ( SAB) in resource-limited settings are limited. The aim of this study was to describe a cohort of South African patients with SAB , and explore the factors associated with complicated infection and death. This was a prospective observational study of patients over the age of 13 years admitted to a South African referral hospital with SAB. One hundred SAB infection episodes occurring in 98 patients were included. SAB was healthcare-associated in 68.4 %; 24.0 % of all cases were caused by methicillin-resistant S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA). Ninety-day mortality was 47.0 % , with 83.3 % of deaths attributable to SAB. There was a trend towards increased 90-day mortality with MRSA infection ( odds ratio ( OR) 1.28 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.0-15.1) and the presence of comorbidities ( OR 4.1 , 95 % CI 1.0-21.6). The risk of complicated infection was higher with non-optimal definitive antibiotic therapy ( OR 8.5 , 95 % CI 1.8-52.4) , female sex ( OR 3.8 , 95 % CI 1.1-16.3) , and community-acquired infection ( OR 7.4 , 95 % CI 2.0-33.1). Definitive antibiotic therapy was non-optimal in 22.6 % of all cases. SAB-related mortality was high. A large proportion of cases may be preventable , and there is a need for improved antibiotic management.
