  Only few data are available on the influence of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4/A5 polymorphisms on nevirapine plasma concentrations in the Caucasian population. Our aim was to assess the impact of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4/A5 polymorphisms on nevirapine plasma concentrations consecutively collected. We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of all HIV-positive patients who were followed at the Infectious<disease> Diseases<disease> Unit , DIBIC Luigi Sacco , University of Milan between January 2000 and December 2015. All patients with at least one nevirapine plasma trough concentration ( NVP C A total of 143 patients were evaluated. Most of them were males ( 61.5 %) and Caucasian ( 92.3 %). Overall , NVP C Our study , conducted in a prevalent Caucasian population , highlighted the importance of CYP2B6 genetic variants in influencing nevirapine plasma trough concentration. Furthermore , older age and hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> coinfection significantly increase exposure to nevirapine.
