  During 2014-2015 , clade 2.3.4.4 H5Nx highly pathogenic ( HP) avian influenza<disease> A viruses ( IAV<pathogen>) were first detected in North<pathogen> America and subsequently caused one of the largest agricultural emergencies in U.S. Recent evidence has suggested that cottontail rabbits can shed multiple IAV<pathogen> subtypes. We experimentally infected cottontail rabbits with three HP H5Nx IAVs. All rabbits tested shed virus on at least one day by at least one route. Cottontail rabbits appear to be an exception to the limited capacity for replication that has been previously reported for certain other mammalian species inoculated with clade 2.3.4.4 HP H5Nx avian influenza<disease> A viruses.
