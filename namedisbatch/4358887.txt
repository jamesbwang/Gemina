  The avian leukosis virus subgroup K ( ALV-K) , a novel subgroup in Chinese indigenous chicken breeds , has been difficult to isolate in the past due to its poor replication ability. However , according to the latest monitoring data , the replication ability and isolation rate of ALV-K have clearly increased , and new strains with mutations in the pol gene have also been found. To determine the effects of such mutations on the biological characteristics of ALV-K , a pair of infectious clones were constructed and rescued. The first virus was an ALV-K Chinese isolate with mutations in its pol gene , named rSDAUAK-11. The second virus was a recuperative rSDAUAK-11 from which mutations in the pol gene were recovered according to the corresponding region of the ALV-K prototype virus JS11C1 , named rRSDAUAK-11. In addition , two quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were developed to specifically detect these virus<pathogen> strains. Using such methods , we observed a marked improvement of the reverse transcriptase activity , replication ability and vertical transmission ability of rSDAUAK-11 , which also revealed a formidable competitive advantage in mixed<disease> infection<disease> with rRSDAUAK-11 and corresponded to the differences between the wild strains SDAUAK-11 and JS11C1. Accordingly , our findings not only show that mutations in the pol gene are an important molecular mechanism contributing to corresponding changes in the biological characteristics of the newest ALV-K but also emphasize the potential future eradication of ALV.
