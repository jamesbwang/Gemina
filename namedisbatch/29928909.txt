  The ultrafine fibers were produced using a polymeric blend of soy protein isolate ( SPI) , polyethylene oxide ( PEO) , and zein at a ratio of 1:1:1 ( v/v/v) by electrospinning. The ginger essential oil ( GEO) was encapsulated in the ultrafine fibers and the morphology , Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy ( FTIR) analysis , thermal properties and relative crystallinity were evaluated. The antimicrobial activity of ginger essential oil was evaluated against five bacteria ( Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> , Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> 0157: H7 , Salmonella<disease> typhimurium<pathogen> , and Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> Based on the preliminary tests , the concentration of GEO selected to add in the polymer solution was 12 % ( v/v; GEO/polymer solution). The fiber produced with 12 % ( v/v) GEO was used for antimicrobial analysis and in situ application ( in fresh Minas cheese) against L.<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> by micro-atmosphere. The ultrafine fibers produced , regardless the concentration of the essential oil , presented homogeneous morphology with cylindrical shape without the presence of beads. The application of the active fibers containing 12 % GEO showed high potential to be applied in food packaging to reduce microbial contamination.
