  Q fever<disease> infection<disease> can lead to chronic Q fever<disease> , a potentially lethal disease occurring in 1-5 % of patients infected with Coxiella<pathogen> burnetii<pathogen> , characterized by the persistence of this intracellular bacterium<pathogen>. It usually presents as endocarditis<disease> , infected vascular aneurysms<disease> , or infected vascular prostheses. This systematic review of the literature discusses the various autoimmune syndromes<disease> and B-cell dyscrasias in acute and chronic Q fever<disease> patients , that may interfere with or impede recognition and diagnosis of Q fever<disease> Reportedly , high concentrations of anti-cardiolipin antibodies may be found in acute Q fever<disease> patients , while specifically cardiac muscle antibodies have been reported during chronic Q fever<disease> Systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome<disease> are the most frequently reported autoimmune syndromes<disease> , followed by neuromuscular disorders and vasculitis. B-cell dyscrasia , mostly cryoglobulinaemia , is predominantly described in chronic Q fever<disease> patients with endocarditis<disease> We conclude that immunological ( epi) phenomena are not rare during Q fever<disease> and may obscure the infectious etiology of the disease.
