  Hepatitis<pathogen> E<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HEV<pathogen>) is an emerging cause of autochthonous-acute-hepatitis and acute-on-chronic-liver-failure in western countries. Treatment is not routinely used , despite ribavirin has a good antiviral effect. In vitro sofosbuvir inhibits HEV<pathogen> replication , but clinical data are lacking. We report a case of acute-on-chronic-liver-failure due to HEV<pathogen> treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin. The treatment was capable of rapidly inducing both HCV<pathogen> and HEV<pathogen> viral suppression. In conclusion , although more data are required before firm conclusions could be drawn , the combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin in not immunosuppressed patients with acute hepatitis<disease> E<disease> may be able to clear HEV<pathogen> infection.
