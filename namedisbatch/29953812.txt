  There is an urgent need for strategies to combat dengue<disease> and other emerging viral<disease> infections<disease>. We reported that cyclin G-associated kinase ( GAK) , a cellular regulator of the clathrin-associated host adaptor proteins AP-1 and AP-2 , regulates intracellular trafficking of multiple unrelated RNA viruses during early and late stages of the viral lifecycle. We also reported the discovery of potent , selective GAK inhibitors based on an isothiazolo ( 4,3- b) pyridine scaffold , albeit with moderate antiviral activity. Here , we describe our efforts leading to the discovery of novel isothiazolo ( 4,3- b) pyridines that maintain high GAK affinity and selectivity. These compounds demonstrate improved in vitro activity against dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> , including in human primary dendritic cells , and efficacy against the unrelated Ebola<disease> and chikungunya<pathogen> viruses. Moreover , inhibition of GAK activity was validated as an important mechanism of antiviral action of these compounds. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of a GAK-targeted broad-spectrum approach for combating currently untreatable emerging
