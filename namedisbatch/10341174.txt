  During January 2013-April 2014 , we subjected nasopharyngeal specimens collected from patients with acute febrile respiratory illness in a military hospital to PCR testing to detect 12 respiratory viruses and sequence a partial hexon gene for human<pathogen> adenovirus<pathogen> ( HAdV) molecular typing. We analyzed the epidemiologic characteristics of HAdV infections and compared clinical characteristics of HAdV types. Among the 305 patients with acute febrile respiratory illness , we detected respiratory viruses in 139 ( 45.6 %) patients; HAdV was the most prevalent virus ( 69 cases). Of the 40 adenoviruses identified based on type , HAdV-55 ( 29 cases) was the most prevalent , followed by HAdV-4 ( 9 cases). HAdV-55 was common in patients with pneumonia<disease> ( odds ratio 2.17; 95 % CI 0.48-9.86) and hospitalized patients ( odds ratio 5.21; 95 % CI 1.06-25.50). In soldiers with HAdV infection in Korea , HAdV-55 was the most prevalent type and might be associated with severe clinical outcomes.
