  Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) is a syndrome<disease> manifesting with snoring and increased respiratory effort due to increased upper airway resistance. In addition to cause the abnormal sleep , this syndrome<disease> has been shown to elicit either growth retardation or metabolic syndrome<disease> and obesity. Treating OSA by adenotonsillectomy is usually associated with increased risk for obesity , despite near complete restoration of breathing and sleep. However , the underlying mechanism linking upper airways obstruction ( AO) to persistent change in food intake , metabolism , and growth remains unclear. Rodent models have examined the impact of intermittent hypoxia on metabolism. However , an additional defining feature of OSA that is not related to intermittent hypoxia is enhanced respiratory loading leading to increased respiratory effort and abnormal sleep. The focus of this mini<pathogen> review is on recent evidence indicating the persistent abnormalities in endocrine regulation of feeding and growth that are not fully restored by the chronic upper AO removal in rats. Here , we highlight important aspects related to abnormal regulation of metabolism that are not related to intermittent hypoxia
