  Cerebral malaria<disease> ( CM) is a severe complication of Plasmodium<pathogen> falciparum<pathogen> infection associated with impaired cerebral blood flow. Visualization of the eye vasculature , which is embryologically derived from that of the brain , is used clinically to diagnose the syndrome<disease>. Here , we introduce camera-phone laser speckle imaging as a new tool for in vivo , noncontact two-dimensional mapping of blood flow dynamics in the experimental cerebral malaria<disease> ( ECM) murine model of Plasmodium<pathogen> berghei ANKA. In a longitudinal study , we show that the camera-phone imager can detect an overall decrease in the retinal blood-flow-speed ( BFS) as ECM develops in P. berghei ANKA infected mice , with no similar change observed in uninfected control mice or mice infected with a non-ECM inducing strain ( P. berghei NK65). Furthermore , by analyzing relative alterations in the BFS of individual retinal vessels during the progression of ECM , we illustrate the strength of our imager in identifying different BFS-change heterogeneities in the retinas of ECM and uninfected mice. The technique creates new possibilities for objective investigations into the diagnosis and pathogenesis of CM noninvasively through the eye.
