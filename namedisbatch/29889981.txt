  The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the spray-drying process on the inactivation of Salmonella<disease> choleraesuis<pathogen> and Salmonella<disease> typhimurium<pathogen> spiked in liquid porcine plasma and to test the additive effect of immediate postdrying storage. Commercial spray-dried porcine plasma was sterilized by irradiation and then reconstituted ( 1:9) with sterile water. Aliquots of reconstituted plasma were inoculated with either S.<pathogen> choleraesuis<pathogen> or S.<pathogen> typhimurium<pathogen> , subjected to spray-drying at an inlet temperature of 200 °C and an outlet temperature of either 71 or 80 °C , and each spray-drying temperature combinations were subjected to either 0 , 30 or 60 s of residence time ( RT) as a simulation of residence time typical of commercial dryers. Spray-dried samples were stored at either 4 · 0 ± 3 · 0 °C or 23 · 0 ± 0 · 3 °C for 15 days. Bacterial counts of each Salmonella<pathogen> spp. , were completed for all samples. For both Salmonella<pathogen> spp. , spray-drying at both outlet temperatures reduced bacterial counts about 3 logs at RT 0 s , while there was about a 5 · 5 log reduction at RT 60 s. Storage of all dried samples at either 4 · 0 ± 3 · 0 °C or 23 · 0 ± 0 · 3 °C for 15 days eliminate all detectable bacterial counts of both Salmonella<pathogen> spp.. Safety of raw materials from animal origin like spray-dried porcine plasma ( SDPP) may be a concern for the swine industry. Spray-drying process and postdrying storage are good inactivation steps to reduce the bacterial load of Salmonella<disease> choleraesuis<pathogen> and Salmonella<disease> typhimurium<pathogen>. For both Salmonella<pathogen> spp. , spray-drying at 71 °C or 80 °C outlet temperatures reduced bacterial counts about 3 log at residence time ( RT) 0 s , while there was about a 5.5 log reduction at RT 60 s. Storage of all dried samples at either 4.0 ± 3.0 °C or 23.0 ± 0.3 °C for 15 days was effective for eliminating detectable bacterial counts of both Salmonella<pathogen> spp..
