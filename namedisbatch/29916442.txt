  Even though malaria<disease> is preventable and curable , it has become a serious threat to mankind. In 2016 , there were an estimated 216 million cases of malaria<disease> across the world. The biology of its causative agent , i.e. Plasmodium<pathogen> parasite is full of complex mechanisms. There are five Plasmodium<pathogen> species responsible for malaria<disease> in humans , viz.. Plasmodium<pathogen> falciparum<pathogen> , P.<pathogen> vivax<disease> , P. malariae , P.<pathogen> ovale<disease> and recently identified P. knowlesi that normally infect apes. In humans , malaria<disease> is spread by the injection of Plasmodium sporozoites through the bite of infectious Anopheles<pathogen> ' female mosquito during their blood meal. From the time of entry into human skin till the development into the asexual forms , the parasite undergoes several transformations. This review attempts to understand the science behind the pre-erythrocytic liver stage of Plasmodium. Research articles explaining parasite biology , cell-traversal , transformation stages , cell-egress process , etc. were retrieved from PubMed and google scholar database. Various known and unknown mechanisms and strategies used by the malaria<disease> parasite P. berghei in rodent models have been discussed in this review. Limited or no information was available for humans , due to technical feasibility and complexity of parasite 's life cycle. Hence , it was concluded that there is an urgent need to investigate the hepatic invasion , traversal and egress mechanism of P.<pathogen> falciparum<disease> and P.<pathogen> vivax<disease> for developing novel therapeutics to fight against
