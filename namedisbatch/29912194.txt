  Vibrio<pathogen> parahaemolyticus<pathogen> ( V.<pathogen> parahaemolyticus<pathogen>) is a common foodborne<disease> pathogen that contributes to a large proportion of public health problems globally , significantly affecting the rate of human mortality and morbidity. Conventional methods for the detection of V.<pathogen> parahaemolyticus<pathogen> such as culture-based methods , immunological assays , and molecular-based methods require complicated sample handling and are time-consuming , tedious , and costly. Recently , biosensors have proven to be a promising and comprehensive detection method with the advantages of fast detection , cost-effectiveness , and practicality. This research focuses on developing a rapid method of detecting V.<pathogen> parahaemolyticus<pathogen> with high selectivity and sensitivity using the principles of DNA hybridization. In the work , characterization of synthesized polylactic acid-stabilized gold nanoparticles ( PLA-AuNPs) was achieved using X-ray Diffraction ( XRD) , Ultraviolet-visible Spectroscopy ( UV-Vis) , Transmission Electron Microscopy ( TEM) , Field-emission Scanning Electron Microscopy ( FESEM) , and Cyclic Voltammetry ( CV). We also carried out further testing of stability , sensitivity , and reproducibility of the PLA-AuNPs. We found that the PLA-AuNPs formed a sound structure of stabilized nanoparticles in aqueous solution. We also observed that the sensitivity improved as a result of the smaller charge transfer resistance ( Rct) value and an increase of active surface area ( 0.41 cm
