  Tetanus<disease> neurotoxin ( TeNT) is taken up at nerve terminals and undergoes retrograde migration. The toxic properties of TeNT reside in the toxin light chain ( L) , but like complete TeNT , the TeNT heavy chain ( TTH) and the C-terminal domain ( TTC) alone can bind and enter into neurons. Here , we explored whether atoxic fragments of TeNT could act as drug delivery vehicles in neurons. In this study , we used Bcl-2 , a protein known to have anti-apoptotic properties in vivo and in vitro , as a parcel to couple to TeNT fragments. We expressed Bcl-2 and the TTC fragments alone , and also attempted to express fusion proteins with the Bcl-2 coupled at the N-terminus of TTH ( Bcl2-TTH) and the N- and C-terminus of TTC ( TTC-Bcl2 and Bcl2-TTC) in mammalian ( Cos7 cells) and Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> systems. TTC and Bcl-2 were efficiently expressed in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and Cos7 cells , respectively , but Bcl-2 and the fusion proteins did not express well in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. The fusion proteins were also not expressed in Cos7 cells. To improve the yield and purity of the fusion protein , we genetically deleted the N-terminal half of TTC from the Bcl2-TTC fusion to yield Bcl2-hTTC. Purified Bcl2-hTTC exhibited neuronal binding and prevented cell death of neuronal PC12 cells induced by serum and NGF deprivation , as evidenced by the inhibition of cytochrome C release from the mitochondria. For in vivo assays , Bcl2-hTTC was injected into the tongues of mice and was seen to selectively migrate to hypoglossal nuclei mouse brain stems via retrograde axonal transport. These results indicate that Bcl2-hTTC retains both Bcl-2 and TTC functions and therefore could be a potent therapeutic agent for various neurological conditions.
