  HIV<pathogen> infection changes the lymph node ( LN) tissue architecture , potentially impairing the immunologic response to antigenic challenge. The tissue-resident immune cell dynamics in virologically suppressed HIV<pathogen> + patients on combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART) are not clear. We obtained LN biopsies before and 10 to 14 days after trivalent seasonal influenza<disease> immunization from healthy controls ( HCs) and HIV<pathogen> + volunteers on cART to investigate CD4 + T follicular helper ( Tfh) and B cell dynamics by flow cytometry and quantitative imaging analysis. Prior to vaccination , compared with those in HCs , HIV<pathogen> + LNs exhibited an altered follicular architecture , but harbored higher numbers of Tfh cells and increased IgG + follicular memory B cells. Moreover , Tfh cell numbers were dependent upon preservation of the follicular dendritic cell ( FDC) network and were predictive of the magnitude of the vaccine-induced IgG responses. Interestingly , postvaccination LN samples in HIV<pathogen> + participants had significantly ( P = 0.0179) reduced Tfh cell numbers compared with prevaccination samples , without evidence for peripheral Tfh ( pTfh) cell reduction. We conclude that influenza<disease> vaccination alters the cellularity of draining LNs of HIV<pathogen> + persons in conjunction with development of antigen-specific humoral responses. The underlying mechanism of Tfh cell decline warrants further investigation , as it could bear implications for the rational design of HIV<pathogen> vaccines.
