  Human<pathogen> respiratory<pathogen> syncytial<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HRSV<pathogen>) is a non-segmented negative stranded RNA virus and is recognized as the most important viral<disease> agent<disease> of lower respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> worldwide , responsible for up to 199,000 deaths each year. The only FDA-approved regime to prevent HRSV-mediated disease is pre-exposure administration of a humanized HRSV-specific monoclonal antibody , which although being effective , is not in widespread usage due to its cost. No HRSV<pathogen> vaccine exists and so there remains a strong need for alternative and complementary anti-HRSV therapies. The HRSV<pathogen> M2-1 protein is a transcription factor and represents an attractive target for the development of antiviral compounds , based on its essential role in the viral replication cycle. To this end , a detailed analysis of M2-1 structure and functions will aid in identifying rational targets for structure-based antiviral drug design that can be developed in future translational research. Here we present an overview of the current understanding of the structure and function of HRSV<pathogen> M2-1 , drawing on additional information derived from its structural homologues from other related viruses.
