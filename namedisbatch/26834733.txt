  Three slowly growing mycobacteria named strain AB308 , strain AB215 and strain AB57 were isolated from the tomato plant roots. The 16S rRNA and rpoB gene sequence analyses suggested that each strain was representative of one hitherto unidentified slowly-growing Mycobacterium<disease> species of the Mycobacterium<pathogen> simiae<pathogen> complex. Genome sequencing indicated that each strain contained one chromosome of 6.015-6.029 Mbp. A total of 1,197 , 1,239 and 1,175 proteins were found to be associated with virulence and 107 , 76 and 82 proteins were associated with toxin/antitoxin systems for strains AB308 , AB215 and AB57 , respectively. The three genomes encode for secondary metabolites , with 38 , 33 and 46 genes found to be associated with polyketide synthases/non-ribosomal peptide synthases and nine , seven and ten genes encoding for bacteriocins , respectively. The genome of strain AB308 encodes for one questionable prophage and three incomplete prophages , while only incomplete prophages were predicted in AB215 and AB57 genomes. Genetic and genomic data indicate that strains AB308 , AB215 and AB57 are each representative of a new Mycobacterium<disease> species that we respectively named Mycobacterium<disease> terramassiliense , Mycobacterium<disease> numidiamassiliense and Mycobacterium<disease> rhizamassiliense.
