  Cryptococcal meningitis<disease> ( CM) is an opportunistic<disease> fungal<disease> disease<disease> with a high mortality among HIV-positive patients with severe immunosuppression ( CD4 count < 100 cells/μl). Reflexed screening for cryptococcal antigen ( CrAg) in remnant blood samples was initially piloted at selected CD4 testing laboratories of the National Health Laboratory Service ( NHLS) prior to the implementation of a national screening programme using a lateral flow assay ( LFA) ( IMMY , Norman , OK , USA). The aim of this study was to assess CrAg positivity nationally , per province and district in combination with the percentage of CD4 samples tested with a CD4 count < 100 cells/μl to identify areas with advanced HIV/CrAg disease burden. CrAg and CD4 laboratory result data were extracted from the NHLS corporate data warehouse. Monthly test volumes were used to assess CrAg test volumes and coverage , while bubble charts were used to display the relationship between CD4 < 100 cells/μl , CrAg positivity and number of positive CrAg samples by district. ArcGIS software was used to spatially report CrAg positivity. CrAg screening coverage was stable at around 96 % after November 2016. Samples with a CD4 < 100 cell/μl and CrAg positivity were also stable over the study period at 10 % and ~ 5 % respectively. The highest CrAg positivity was reported for the Kwa-Zulu Natal province ( 7.3 %) , which also had the lowest percentage of samples with a CD4 < 100 cells/μl ( 7.2 %). Uthungulu and Umkhanyakude districts had the highest CrAg positivity ( 9.3 % and 8.9 % respectively). Ethekwini and Johannesburg Metro districts contributed to 22 % of the total number of CrAg-positive samples tested across South Africa for the period reported. Existing CD4 testing services were used to rapidly scale up CrAg reflex testing in South Africa. Districts with advanced HIV<pathogen> and CrAg disease burden were identified that need further investigation of patient management interventions.
