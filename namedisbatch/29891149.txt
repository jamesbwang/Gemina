  Highly pathogenic avian influenza<disease> virus<pathogen> ( HPAIV) H5N1<pathogen> has been reported in Asia , including Indonesia since 2003. Although several risk factors related to the HPAIV outbreaks in poultry in Indonesia have been identified , little is known of the contact structure of farms of different poultry production types ( backyard chickens , broilers , layers , and ducks). This study aims to quantify the contact rates associated with the movement of people , and movements of live birds and products and equipment that affect the risk of HPAIV H5N1<pathogen> transmission between poultry farms in Indonesia. On 124 poultry farms in 6 districts in West Java , logbooks were distributed to record the movements of farmers/staff and visitors and their poultry contacts. Most movements in backyard chicken , commercial native chicken , broiler and duck farms were visits to and from other poultry farms , whilst in layer farms visits to and from poultry companies , visits to egg collection houses and visit from other poultry farms were most frequent. Over 75 % of persons visiting backyard chicken and duck farms had previously visited other poultry farms on the same day. Visitors of backyard chicken farms had the highest average contact rate , either direct contact with poultry on other farms before the visits ( 1.35 contact/day) or contact during their visits in the farms ( 10.03 contact/day). These results suggest that backyard chicken farms are most at risk for transmission of HPAIV compared to farms of the other poultry production types. Since visits of farm-to-farm were high , backyard farms could also a potential source for HPAIV transmission to commercial poultry farms.
