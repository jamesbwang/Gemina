  Although nasal septal abscess<disease> ( NSA) was formerly common , it has become rare since the development of antibiotics. NSA , if left untreated , can lead to intracranial complications such as meningitis<disease> and eventually result in saddle-nose deformity. NSA often occurs after injury , and indigenous skin bacteria such as Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> are frequently detected. We treated a patient who had injured the upper alveolus in a fall on the stairs and developed NSA two weeks later. Anaerobic bacteria , including Veillonella<pathogen> parvula<pathogen> and Peptostreptococcus<pathogen> sp. , were detected. Symptoms were relieved by needle and incisional drainage. Our patient represents a very rare case of NSA in terms of the cause of onset and the detected bacteria. Early drainage can result in good outcomes.
