  Detecting gastrointestinal ( GI) infection transmission among men who have sex with men ( MSM) in England is complicated by a lack of routine sexual behavioural data. We investigated whether gender distributions might generate signals for increased transmission of GI pathogens among MSM. We examined the percentage male of laboratory-confirmed patient-episodes for patients with no known travel history for 10 GI infections of public health interest in England between 2003 and 2013 , stratified by age and region. An adult male excess was observed for Shigella<pathogen> spp. ( annual maximum 71 % male); most pronounced for those aged 25-49 years and living in London , Brighton and Manchester. An adult male excess was observed every year for Entamoeba histolytica<pathogen> ( range 59.8-76.1 % male) , Giardia ( 53.1-57.6 %) and Campylobacter<pathogen> ( 52.1-53.5 %) and for a minority of years for hepatitis<disease> A<disease> ( max. 69.8 %) and typhoidal salmonella<pathogen> ( max. 65.7 %). This approach generated a signal for excess male episodes for six GI pathogens , including a characterised outbreak of Shigella<pathogen> among MSM. Stratified analyses by geography and age group were consistent with MSM transmission for Shigella<pathogen> Optimisation and routine application of this technique by public health authorities elsewhere might help identify potential GI infection outbreaks due to sexual transmission among MSM , for further investigation.
