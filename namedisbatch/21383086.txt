  Successful management of pediatric and adult human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) disease includes lifelong administration of antiretroviral therapy ( ART). The need for the continuous use of antiretroviral drugs throughout the life course poses a challenge to children , adolescents , and adults living with HIV<pathogen> and their caregivers. Historically , treatment interruptions have been viewed as a negative therapeutic strategy. Recently , however , treatment interruptions or treatment reduction strategies have become a focus of investigations as innovative approaches to the long-term management of HIV<pathogen> disease. Current challenges with treatment interruptions include identifying an appropriate timeframe for length of interruptions and identifying HIV<pathogen> patient populations in whom the treatment interruption can be successful. In this review , we aimed at summarizing recent studies of planned and unplanned treatment interruptions in children and adults living with HIV<pathogen>. We searched two databases ( PubMed and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register) using keywords ( HIV<pathogen> OR AIDS OR acquired immunodeficiency<disease> syndrome<disease> OR HIV-1 OR antiretroviral) AND ( treatment interruption OR planned interruption OR therapeutic interruption OR unplanned interruption) , for published randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials and observational cohort studies in children and adults ( from birth to 99 years of age) in global settings covering a period from 2012 to 2018. In this review , only the studies that contained pediatric and adolescent populations with baseline immunological , virological , and clinical characteristics and outcomes after treatment interruption were included. A total of 174 eligible citations from the two databases were identified. We identified 10 prospective treatment interruption studies on children ( five studies) and adults ( five studies) during 2012-2018 with a total of 863 pediatric and 273 adult subjects. Collectively , recent studies on children and adults with HIV<pathogen> infection suggest that treatment interruptions with proper monitoring can be successful by instituting well-defined immunological and virological parameters or thresholds such as CD4 count , CD4 % , and HIV<pathogen> RNA viral load that identify low-risk populations with treatment failure. In addition to standard virological and immunological outcome measurements , selected biomarkers that help detect early immune activation may also be useful in the monitoring of treatment interruption. Treatment interruptions in adult and especially pediatric patients with well-controlled HIV<pathogen> disease may provide an alternative opportunity to optimize long-term HIV<pathogen> management by minimizing drug-associated toxicity and improving long-term adherence and quality of life.
