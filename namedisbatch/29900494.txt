  Influenza<disease> is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus with segmented genome. Each segment is encapsidated by a ribonucleoprotein ( RNP) complex<pathogen> composed of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRP) and multiple copies of nucleoprotein ( NP). The RNP complex plays a crucial role in viral life cycle , supporting and regulating transcription and replication of viral genome in infected cells. The structural characterization of RdRP and RNP in recent years has shed light on its functions and mechanism of action. In this review , we summarize current understanding on the structure of RNP complex , as well as the structure of each subunit. Crucial functions of RNP are also discussed.
