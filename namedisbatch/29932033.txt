  We discuss the diverse biological activities , therapeutic potential , and clinical applications of peptides and proteins isolated from various yams species including Dioscorea opposita Thunb ( Chinese yam) , D alata , D japonica<pathogen> ( Japanese yam) , D pseudojaponica , D batatas ( Korea yam) , and D cayenensis. Yam peptides and proteins have many pharmacological activities including immunomodulatory , antioxidant , estrogen-stimulating , osteogenic , angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibiting , carbonic anhydrase and trypsin inhibiting , chitinase , anti-insect , anti-dust mite , lectin , and anti-proliferative activities. Yam peptides and proteins have therapeutic potential for treating cardiovascular diseases , inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> , cancers , aging disorders , menopause , and osteoporosis.
