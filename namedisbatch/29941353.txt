  Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> , a clinically relevant Gram-positive bacterium<pathogen> of great clinical relevance , is a lethal pathogen owing to its complex physiological characteristics and development of drug resistance. Several molecular genetic tools have been developed in the past few decades to study this microorganism. These tools have been instrumental in understanding how M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> became a successful pathogen. Advanced molecular genetic tools have played a significant role in exploring the complex pathways involved in M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> pathogenesis. Here , we review various molecular genetic tools used in the study of M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease>. Further , we discuss the applications of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat interference ( CRISPRi) , a novel technology recently applied in M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> research to study target gene functions. Finally , prospective outcomes of the applications of molecular techniques in the field of M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> genetic research are also discussed.
