  New microbial performance standards for chicken parts necessitate postchill antimicrobial interventions to make poultry parts safer for consumers. This research was conducted to determine the effectiveness of antimicrobials ( 0.003 % chlorine; 0.07 % acidified sodium chlorite ( ASC) , 0.07 or 0.1 % peracetic acid ( PAA) , and 0.35 or 0.60 % cetylpyridinium chloride ( CPC)) when used in a postchill decontamination tank to reduce Salmonella<pathogen> and Campylobacter<pathogen> on broiler chicken parts ( including breasts<disease> , thighs , wings , and drumsticks) and to determine the sensory attributes of the treated samples. Samples ( n = 90 , 9 treatments × 5 samples × 2 replications) were inoculated with Salmonella<disease> Typhimurium<pathogen> ( 10
