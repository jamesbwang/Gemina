  Anti-lipopolysaccharide factor ( ALF) is an immune-related protein that is crucially involved in immune defense mechanisms against invading pathogens in crustaceans. In the current study , three different ALFs of giant river prawn<disease> ( Mr-ALF3 , Mr-ALF8 and Mr-ALF9) were discovered. Based on sequence analysis , Mr-ALF3 and Mr-ALF9 were identified as new members of ALFs in crustaceans ( groups F and G , respectively). Structurally , each newly identified Mr-ALF contained three α-helices packed against a four-stranded β-sheet bearing the LPS-binding motif , which usually binds to the cell wall components of bacteria. Tissue expression analysis using quantitative real-time RT-PCR ( qRT-PCR) demonstrated that Mr-ALF3 was expressed in most tissues , and the highest expression was in the heart and hemocytes. The Mr-ALF8 gene was highly expressed in the heart , hemocytes , midgut , hepatopacreas and hindgut , respectively , while the Mr-ALF9 gene was modestly expressed in the heart and hemocytes , respectively. The transcriptional responses of the Mr-ALFs to Aeromonas<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> and hot/cold temperatures were investigated by qRT-PCR in the gills , hepatopancreas and hemocytes. We found that all Mr-ALFs were clearly suppressed in all tested tissues when the experimental prawns<disease> were exposed to extreme temperatures ( 25 and 35 °C). Moreover , the expression levels of these genes were significantly induced in all examined tissues by 2 different concentrations of A.<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> ( 1 × 10
