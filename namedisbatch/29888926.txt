  Good syndrome<disease> ( GS) is an adult-onset immunodeficiency characterized by coexisting thymoma and hypogammaglobulinemia. Clinical course after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg) has rarely been reported. To investigate and report the clinical course and outcomes of GS patients after treatment with IVIg at Thailand 's largest national tertiary referral hospital METHODS: This retrospective chart review included patients diagnosed with GS and treated with IVIg during the 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2015 study period. Nine GS patients with a median age at diagnosis of 53 years were included. Pneumonia<disease> and sepsis<disease> were the most common clinical manifestations. Six infectious organisms suggestive of cell-mediated immunity defect occurred in six patients , including cytomegalovirus ( CMV) , Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> , Mycobacterium<pathogen> abscessus<pathogen> , Herpes<disease> simplex<disease> virus ( HSV) , Pneumocystis<pathogen> jirovecii<pathogen> , and Aspergillus<pathogen>. Mean serum IgG level was 317 mg/dL. Eight patients had very low to undetectable B-cells. Five patients had either low CD4 number or impaired T-cell function , and one patient had both. All patients received IVIg replacement therapy monthly at a dose of 0.4 g/kg. The mean trough IgG level was 881 mg/dL. After treatment with IVIg replacement , seven patients had favorable clinical outcomes. However , two patients expired due to septicemia<disease> Clinical outcomes of patients with GS are more dependent on the severity of infections and associated hematologic and autoimmune diseases than on the severity of thymoma itself. Therefore , early recognition and prompt IVIg replacement may change the natural course of this condition and may be successful in keeping the patient infections free.
