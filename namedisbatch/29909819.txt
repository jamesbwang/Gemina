  Since 2012-2016 an increased number of listeriosis<disease> cases , especially from one region of the Czech Republic , were observed. Most of them were caused by strains of serotype 1/2a<pathogen> , clonal complex 8 , indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Twenty-six human cases were reported , including two neonatal cases in twins. Three cases were fatal. The typing of Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> isolates from food enabled to confirm a turkey meat delicatessen as the vehicle of infection for this local outbreak in the Moravian-Silesian Region. The food strains belonging to identical pulsotype were isolated from ready-to-eat turkey meat products packaged by the same producer between 2012 and 2016. This fact confirms that the described L.<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> outbreak strain probably persisted in the environment of the aforementioned food-processing plant over several years. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed a very close relationship ( zero to seven different alleles) between isolates from humans , foods and swabs from the environment of the food-processing plant under investigation.
