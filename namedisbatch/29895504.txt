  In Tuscany , Italy , where a universal immunization program with monovalent meningococcal C conjugate vaccine ( MCC) was introduced in 2005 , an outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease ( IMD) due to the hypervirulent strain of Neisseria<pathogen> meningitidis C/cc11 occurred in 2015-2016 , leading to an immunization reactive campaign using either the tetravalent ( ACWY) meningococcal conjugate or the MCC vaccine. During the outbreak , IMD serogroup<pathogen> C ( MenC) cases were also reported among vaccinated individuals. This study aimed to characterize meningococcal C conjugate vaccines ( MenC-vaccines) failures and to estimate their effectiveness since the introduction ( 2005-2016) and during the outbreak ( 2015-2016). MenC cases and related vaccine-failures were drawn from the National Surveillance System of Invasive<disease> Bacterial<disease> Disease<disease> ( IBD) for the period 2006-2016. A retrospective cohort-study , including the Tuscany ' population of the birth-cohorts 1994-2014 , was carried out. Based on annual reports of vaccination , person-years of MenC-vaccines exposed and unexposed individuals were calculated by calendar-year , birth-cohort , and local health unit. Adjusted ( by birth-cohort , local health unit , and calendar-year) risk-ratios ( ARR) of MenC invasive disease for vaccinated vs unvaccinated were estimated by the Poisson model. Vaccine-effectiveness ( VE) was estimated as: VE = 1-ARR. In the period 2006-2016 , 85 MenC-invasive disease cases were reported; 61 ( 71.8 %) from 2015 to 2016. Twelve vaccine failures occurred , all of them during the outbreak. The time-interval from immunization to IMD onset was 20 days in one case , from 9 months to 3 years in six cases , and â‰¥ 7 years in five cases. VE was , 100 % ( 95 % CI not estimable , p = 0.03) before the outbreak ( 2006-2014) and 77 % ( 95 % CI 36-92 , p < 0.01) during the outbreak; VE was 80 % ( 95 % CI 54-92 , p < 0.01) during the overall period. In Tuscany , MenC-vaccine failures occurred exclusively during the 2015-2016 outbreak. Most of them occurred several years after vaccination. VE during the outbreak-period was rather high supporting an effective protection induced by MenC-vaccines.
