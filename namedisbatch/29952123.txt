  Increasing incidence of onychomycosis and tinea<disease> pedis<disease> in humans of industrialized countries together with deep tissue<disease> infections<disease> are a therapeutic challenge in clinical mycology. For a better understanding of the pathology and immunology of infection , the authors analyze the exoproteomes of three reference strains of the most common clinical dermatophyte species ( Trichophyton<pathogen> rubrum<pathogen> , Trichophyton<pathogen> interdigitale , Arthroderma<pathogen> benhamiae<pathogen>) and of Trichophyton strains isolated from affected patients. Extracellular proteins of those in vitro grown strains are separated via 2D High Performance Electrophoresis and identified by mass spectrometry to find proteins with provoked host immune reactivity. More than 80 secreted proteins including virulence factors such as peptidases and other hydrolases are identified. By Western blotting with respective patient sera , up to 31 proteins with significant antigen-antibody reactions are detected in comparison with control sera , for example , peptidases as well as several oxidoreductases. One protein , beta-glucosidase F2SZI9 seems to be a commonly processed antigen in all Trichophyton<pathogen> infections. These first global exoproteome data of three dermatophyte species can be a stepping stone on the way to further study the molecular mechanisms of Trichophyton<pathogen> pathogenicity-associated traits. Possible candidates for potential new diagnostic methods or vaccination have to be validated in further investigations.
