  Diutina<pathogen> catenulata<pathogen> ( Candida catenulata<pathogen>) is an ascomycetous yeast that has been isolated from humans , animals and environmental sources. The species is a contaminant of dairy products , and has been linked to superficial and invasive<disease> infections<disease> in both humans and animals. Previous phylogenetic analyses have assigned the species to the Saccharomycetales , but failed to identify its specific clade. Here , we report the genome sequence of an environmental isolate of D.<pathogen> catenulata<pathogen>. Examination of the tRNA repertoire and coding potential of this species shows that it translates the CUG codon as serine and not leucine. In addition , two phylogenetic analyses using 204 ubiquitous gene family alignments and 3,826 single-copy genes both confirm the placement of the species in the Debaryomycetaceae/Metschnikowiaceae , or CTG-Ser clade. The sequenced isolate contains an MTLα idiomorph. However , unlike most MTL loci in related species , poly ( A) polymerase ( PAP) is not adjacent to MTLα1.
