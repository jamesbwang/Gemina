  Influenza<disease> infection is a major public health threat. The role of influenza<disease> A<pathogen> virus-induced inflammatory response in severe cases of this disease is widely recognized. Drug resistance and side effects of chemical treatments have been observed , resulting in increased interest in alternative use of herbal medications for prophylaxis against this infection. The South African medicinal plant , Rapanea melanophloeos ( RM) ( L.) Mez of the family Myrsinaceae was selected owing to its traditional use for the treatment of several diseases such as respiratory ailments and also previous preliminary studies of anti-influenza activity of its methanolic extract. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunomodulatory properties of a glycoside flavone isolated from RM against influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> The non-cytotoxic concentration of the quercetin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside ( Q3R) was determined by MTT assay and tested for activity against influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( IAV<pathogen>) in simultaneous , pre-penetration and post-penetration combination treatments over 1 h incubation on MDCK cells. The virus titer and viral load targeting NP and M2 viral genes were determined using HA and qPCR , respectively. TNF-α and IL-27 as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were measured at RNA and protein levels by qPCR and ELISA , respectively. Quercetin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside at 150 μg/ml decreased the viral titer by 6 logs ( p < 0.01) in the simultaneous procedure. The NP and M2 genes copy numbers as viral target genes , calculated based on the Ct values and standard formula , significantly decreased in simultaneous treatment ( p < 0.01). The expression of cytokines was also considerably affected by the compound treatment. This is the first report of quercetin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside from RM and its immunomodulatory properties against influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> Further research will focus on detecting the specific mechanism of virus-host interactions.
