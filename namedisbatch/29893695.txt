  HAVCR1 protein is the cellular receptor for hepatitis<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HAV<pathogen>). Genetic polymorphism in this gene may alter the outcome of HAV<pathogen> infection. In a previous study , a 6-amino acid insertion ( 157insMTTTVP) in HAVCR1 gene was associated with more severe disease. We decided to investigate this association further. We sequenced exon 4 of the HAVCR1 gene in patients with clinical hepatitis<disease> A attending our institution , and a group of healthy controls in a disease-endemic setting in India. Frequencies of different haplotypes of a genomic region with two overlapping insertion-deletion polymorphisms ( indels; rs141023871 and rs139041445) were compared between patients and controls , as well as between patients with and without a severe form of disease ( liver failure). The gene had three haplotypes in the region of interest- a short form , an intermediate-form with a 5-amino acid 157insMTTVP insertion and a long-form with a 6-amino acid 157insMTTTVP insertion. The allele frequency ( 29/150 ( 19 %) vs. 43/146 ( 29 %); p = ns) and haplotype frequency ( 29/75 ( 39 %) vs. 39/73 ( 53 %); p = ns) of the 157insMTTTVP variant were similar in hepatitis<disease> A<disease> patients and healthy controls ( 30 %). Further , the allele frequency ( 12/58 ( 21 %) vs. 17/92 ( 18 %); p = ns) and haplotype frequency ( 12/29 ( 41 %) vs. 17/46 ( 37 %); p = ns) of the longest variant were also similar in patients with severe and mild disease. In the study population , the 157insMTTTVP variant of HAVCR1 gene was not associated with more severe outcome of HAV<pathogen> infection. Further studies in other populations around the world are needed to assess the relation of this genetic variation with disease outcome.
