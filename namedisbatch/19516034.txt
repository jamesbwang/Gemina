  Although the current Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) epidemic is a major public health concern , most reports have focused on congenital ZIKV syndrome<disease> , its most devastating manifestation. Severe ocular complications associated with ZIKV infections and possible pathogenetic factors are rarely described. Here , we describe three Venezuelan patients who developed severe ocular manifestations following ZIKV infections. We also analyse their serological response to ZIKV and dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( DENV<pathogen>). One adult with bilateral optic neuritis , a child of 4 years of age with retrobulbar uveitis and a newborn with bilateral congenital glaucoma had a recent history of an acute exanthematous infection consistent with ZIKV infection. The results of ELISA tests indicated that all patients were seropositive for ZIKV and four DENV<pathogen> serotypes. Patients with ZIKV infection can develop severe ocular complications. Anti-DENV antibodies from previous infections could play a role in the pathogenesis of these complications. Well-designed epidemiological studies are urgently needed to measure the risk of ZIKV ocular complications and confirm whether they are associated with the presence of anti-flaviviral antibodies.
