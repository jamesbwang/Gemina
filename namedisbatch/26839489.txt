  This nationwide , prospective cohort study evaluated pulmonary function and radiological sequelae according to infection severity in 73 survivors from the 2015 Middle<pathogen> East<pathogen> respiratory<disease> syndrome<disease> ( MERS) outbreak in Korea. Patients with severe pneumonia<disease> in MERS-coronavirus infection had more impaired pulmonary function than those with no or mild pneumonia<disease> at the 1-year follow-up , which was compatible with the radiological sequelae. Severe pneumonia<disease> significantly impairs pulmonary function and makes long radiological sequelae in MERS.
