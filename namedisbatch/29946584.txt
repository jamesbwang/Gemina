  The human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> ( PA) is responsible for chronic<disease> infections<disease> of the respiratory epithelium in cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> patients. PA takes advantage of an arsenal of virulence factors to infect and colonize human lungs. Among them , the lectin LecA favours epithelium invasion by interacting with host cell globotriaosylceramide ( Gb3). A new therapeutic approach is based on the development of synthetic multivalent molecules ( glycoclusters) targeting LecA with a higher affinity than its natural ligand. Atomic force microscopy-single cell force spectroscopy has been used to study the effect of glycoclusters on the bacteria-cell interaction. Glycoclusters have been shown to affect the detachment work and detachment force of the bacteria-cell interaction. The specificity and the efficiency of the glycocluster in targeting the lectin and destabilizing the PA-epithelial cell adhesion are demonstrated and discussed.
