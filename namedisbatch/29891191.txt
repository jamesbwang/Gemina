  Accurate and reliable drug susceptibility testing ( DST) is essential for the effective treatment and control of tuberculosis<disease> With the increase in drug-resistant organisms , newer and less conventional antimicrobial agents are used for treatment. Recently , we found an unprecedented rise in the number of clofazimine-resistant Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> isolates in our laboratory. An investigation found that this phenomenon was due to a change in the method of drug preparation. We performed studies to assess the impact of water and dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO) as a final diluent for clofazimine drug testing. Based on our findings , the use of DMSO as a solvent for M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> DST was optimised using the BACTEC MGIT 960 platform.
