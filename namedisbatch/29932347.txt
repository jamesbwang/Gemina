  Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> is a common veterinary and human pathogen that persists as latent bradyzoite forms within infected hosts. The ability of the parasite to interconvert between tachyzoite and bradyzoite is key for pathogenesis of toxoplasmosis<disease> , particularly in immunocompromised individuals. The transition between tachyzoites and bradyzoites is epigenetically regulated and coupled to the cell cycle. Recent epigenomic studies have begun to elucidate the chromatin states associated with developmental switches in T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen>. Evidence is also emerging that AP2 transcription factors both activate and repress the bradyzoite developmental program. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms by which T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> transduces environmental signals to coordinate the epigenetic and transcriptional machinery that are responsible for tachyzoite-bradyzoite interconversion.
