  Clostridium<pathogen> perfringens<pathogen> is one of the leading causes of food<disease> poisoning<disease> worldwide. The aims of this study were to investigate the presence of C.<pathogen> perfringens<disease> in food supplied to school cafeterias , to assess the presence of toxin genes in the isolates , and to investigate the biofilm formation and antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates. A total of 30 C.<pathogen> perfringens<disease> strains ( 12.9 %) from 232 samples of beef , pork , chicken , and duck meat were isolated. Toxin genes , including cpa , cpe , cpb2 , and netB , were detected , while the cpb , etx , iap and tpeL genes were absent. Biofilm formation was analyzed , and all the isolates were able to form biofilm. Antibiotic resistance was observed against penicillin ( 97 %) , lincomycin ( 20 %) , bacitracin ( 97 %) , oxytetracycline ( 73 %) , trimethoprim ( 7 %) , gentamicin ( 10 %) , tetracycline ( 93 %) , erythromycin ( 83 %) , ampicillin ( 100 %) , amikacin ( 7 %) , and streptomycin ( 3 %). In conclusion , the results showed that students are exposed to a potentially high risk of food<disease> poisoning<disease> by C.<pathogen> perfringens<disease>; therefore , precaution is required for these types of catering services.
