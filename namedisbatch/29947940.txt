  Paul Ferdinand Schilder was born in Vienna in 1886 and died in New<pathogen> York in 1940. He is nowadays remembered predominantly for his contributions to modern psychiatry and psychotherapy; however , he was also a neurologist and neuroscientist and in particular in his early years , he researched and published on neuropathological topics. This paper focuses on his scientific work during his years in Middle Germany ( 1909-1914) , where he worked with Gabriel Anton in Halle and Paul Flechsig in Leipzig. During those years , he laid the foundations for his definition , clinical classification and differentiation of encephalitis<disease> periaxialis diffusa. Today , this inflammatory brain disease is known as Schilder 's disease and is of some importance as a rare differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis ( MS) , especially in children. Schilder 's reflections and findings were based on his scrupulous and detailed analysis of only a few medical histories , which also comprised histological neuropathological examinations , as well as on his extensive and critical review of the relevant literature of the time. His aim was to differentiate encephalitis<disease> periaxialis diffusa from brain tumors , MS and Heubner 's diffuse sclerosis. Schilder 's scientific achievement , made in relatively young years , is still impressive even to the present day due do its thoroughness and accuracy as well as the enormous workload and ambition it required. Even though ambitious , Schilder was always prepared to critically review his own ideas.
