  Enterococci represent one of the microbial world 's most challenging enigmas. Colonization of the gastrointestinal tract ( GIT) of high-risk/immunocompromised patients by enterococci exhibiting resistance to vancomycin ( VRE) can lead to life-threating infections , including bloodstream infections and endocarditis<disease> Decolonization of VRE from the GIT of high-risk patients represents an alternative method to suppress the risk of the infection. It could be considered as a preventative measure to protect against VRE infections in high-risk individuals. Though multiple agents ( ramoplanin and bacitracin) have been evaluated clinically , no drugs are currently approved for use in VRE decolonization of the GIT. The present study evaluates ebselen , a clinical molecule , for use as a decolonizing agent against VRE. When evaluated against a broad array of enterococcal isolates in vitro , ebselen was found to be as potent as linezolid ( minimum inhibitory concentration against 90 % of clinical isolates tested was 2 Î¼g/ml). Though VRE has a remarkable ability to develop resistance to antibacterial agents , no resistance to ebselen emerged after a clinical isolate of vancomycin-resistant E.<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> was serially-passaged with ebselen for 14 days. Against VRE biofilm , a virulence factor that enables the bacteria to colonize the gut , ebselen demonstrated the ability to both inhibit biofilm formation and disrupt mature biofilm. Furthermore , in a murine VRE colonization reduction model , ebselen proved as effective as ramoplanin in reducing the bacterial shedding and burden of VRE present in the fecal content ( by > 99.99 %) , cecum , and ileum of mice. Based on the promising results obtained , ebselen warrants further investigation as a novel decolonizing agent to quell VRE infection.
