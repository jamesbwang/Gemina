  Morbidity and mortality resulting from influenza-like disease are a threat , especially for older adults. To improve case management , next-generation broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics that are efficacious against major drivers of influenza-like disease , including influenza<disease> viruses and respiratory<pathogen> syncytial<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( RSV<pathogen>) , are urgently needed. Using a dual-pathogen high-throughput screening protocol for influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( IAV<pathogen>) and RSV<pathogen> inhibitors , we have identified
