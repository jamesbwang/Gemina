  The hepatic Na +/ taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide ( NTCP in man , Ntcp in animals) is the high-affinity receptor for the hepatitis<disease> B<disease> ( HBV<pathogen>) and hepatitis<disease> D<disease> ( HDV<pathogen>) viruses<pathogen>. Species barriers for human HBV/HDV within the order Primates were previously attributed to Ntcp sequence variations that disable virus-receptor interaction. However , only a limited number of primate Ntcps have been analysed so far. In the present study , a total of 11 Ntcps from apes , Old and New World monkeys were cloned and expressed in vitro to characterise their interaction with HBV and HDV<pathogen>. All Ntcps showed intact bile salt transport. Human NTCP as well as the Ntcps from the great apes chimpanzee and orangutan showed transport-competing binding of HBV<pathogen> derived myr-preS1-peptides. In contrast , all six Ntcps from the group of Old World monkeys were insensitive to HBV<pathogen> myr-preS1-peptide binding and HBV/HDV infection. This is basically predetermined by the amino acid arginine at position 158 of all studied Old World monkey Ntcps. An exchange from arginine to glycine ( as present in humans and great apes) at this position ( R158G) alone was sufficient to achieve full transport-competing HBV<pathogen> myr-preS1-peptide binding and susceptibility for HBV/HDV infection. New World monkey Ntcps showed higher sequence heterogeneity , but in two cases with 158G showed transport-competing HBV myr-preS1-peptide binding , and in one case ( Saimiri sciureus) even susceptibility for HBV/HDV infection. In conclusion , amino acid position 158 of NTCP/Ntcp is sufficient to discriminate between the HBV/HDV susceptible group of humans and great apes ( 158G) and the non-susceptible group of Old World monkeys ( 158R). In the case of the phylogenetically more distant New World monkey Ntcps amino acid 158 plays a significant , but not exclusive role.
