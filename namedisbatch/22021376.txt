  Treponema<pathogen> pallidum<pathogen> infections occur worldwide causing , among other diseases , syphilis<disease> and yaws<disease> In particular sexually transmitted syphilis<disease> is regarded as a re-emerging infectious<disease> disease<disease> with millions of new infections annually. Here we present three historic T.<pathogen> pallidum<pathogen> genomes ( two from T.<pathogen> pallidum<pathogen> ssp. pallidum<pathogen> and one from T.<pathogen> pallidum<pathogen> ssp. pertenue<pathogen>) that have been reconstructed from skeletons recovered from the Convent of Santa Isabel in Mexico City , operational between the 17th and 19th century. Our analyses indicate that different T.<pathogen> pallidum<pathogen> subspecies caused similar diagnostic presentations that are normally associated with syphilis<disease> in infants , and potential evidence of a congenital infection of T.<pathogen> pallidum<pathogen> ssp. pertenue<pathogen> , the causative agent of yaws<disease> This first reconstruction of T.<pathogen> pallidum<pathogen> genomes from archaeological material opens the possibility of studying its evolutionary history at a resolution previously assumed to be out of reach.
