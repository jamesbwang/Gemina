  To improve RT-qPCR with an internal control and a synthetic standard curve to detect HEV in HIV<pathogen> co-infected patients. A single-stranded RNA ( ssRNA) and a double-stranded DNA ( dsDNA) synthetic curve were designed , compared to the international reference panel for HEV genotypes , and tested to quantify and detect a reference panel for HEV genotypes. The detection limit of the RNA synthetic curve ( 50 copies per ml) was better than the DNA synthetic curve ( 100 copies per ml) and the WHO standard curve ( 250 copies per ml). Then , 280 serum samples from HIV-positive patients were tested for HEV RNA , which was detected in 3 · 6 % of serum samples. The viral load ranged from 2 × 10 Real-time PCR was a useful tool to estimate co-infection with HEV/HIV , even in patients with low viral loads and undetectable anti-HEV IgG and IgM antibodies. Hepatitis<pathogen> E<pathogen> virus<pathogen> genotype 3 ( HEV<pathogen> GT3) has been associated with silent chronic hepatitis<disease> and cirrhosis in HIV-positive subjects worldwide , but there is a lack of data on this co-infection in Brazil.
