  To assess the pathological outcomes of surgically-managed human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) positive oropharyngeal<disease> squamous cell carcinoma ( OPSCC) using the 8th Edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual ( AJCC-8ed). A retrospective review was conducted of 156 patients with previously untreated OPSCC who underwent primary TORS between March 2010 and February 2015 to evaluate the impact of the new AJCC-8ed pathologic staging system. Only patients who had complete pathologic staging with neck dissection and at least 2 years of follow-up records or disease recurrence within 2 years were included for analysis. Of the 156 patients , 116 patients had neck dissections and adequate follow-up data. There were 10 total recurrences , including 2 regional recurrences and 1 local recurrence. Lymph node size , number of positive lymph nodes , and presence of any positive nodes were not associated with recurrence for HPV-positive patients. The presence of extranodal extension approached significance. Pathologic N-stage was not predictive of recurrence under the AJCC-7ed or the AJCC-8ed systems. Cancer staging under the AJCC-8ed , but not the AJCC-7ed system was significantly associated with recurrence. In conclusion , pathologic node status as defined in the AJCC-8ed pathologic staging system does not appear to drive prognosis for surgically managed patients. While the new AJCC-8ed staging is an improvement in prognostication , the use of T-stage alone is still a better predictor of recurrence. TORS with adjuvant therapy determined by pathologic findings provides excellent locoregional control for HPV-positive OPSCC.
