  A major public health issue , Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> infection can affect humans mainly via the consumption of animal products from certain species , including small ruminants. Therefore , a regular monitoring of the infection in ovine and caprine populations is advisable for the control of human and animal toxoplasmosis<disease> Antibody detection in individual and bulk tank milk may represent a valid alternative to serological analysis , being its collection easy and not affecting animal welfare. Many serological tools for milk analysis have already been validated for several parasites , including Apicomplexa. Thus , the aim of the present study was to obtain epidemiological data on T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> infection through the detection of antibodies in bulk tank milk of dairy goat herds from an important area for caprine dairy production ( Northern Italy). The performance of a commercial ELISA was first evaluated for analysis on caprine milk samples , using a panel of serum-milk pairs of goats naturally infected by T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen>. The analysis on bulk tank milk confirmed the presence of antibodies anti-T. gondii<pathogen> in 59 % of the samples. Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> antibody positivity was more frequently found in farms reared under extensive ( 64.9 %) or semi-intensive systems ( 68.7 %) in comparison to intensive farms ( 51.1 %). Analysis on milk revealed to be a valid alternative to serological tests , being easily applied in large-scale epidemiological surveys and for continuous monitoring of T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> infection.
