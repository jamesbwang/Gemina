  Ascarid Larva Migrans Syndrome<disease> ( ascarid LMS) is a clinical syndrome<disease> in humans , caused by the migration of animal roundworm larvae such as Toxocara canis<pathogen> , Toxocara cati and Ascaris suum. Humans may acquire infection by ingesting embryonated eggs , or infective larvae of these parasites in contaminated meat and organ meats. To detect these pathogenic contaminations , a novel nested multiplex PCR system was developed. Our novel nested multiplex PCR assay showed specific amplification of T. canis<pathogen> , T. cati and Ascaris spp.. Detection limit of the nested multiplex PCR was tested with serial dilution of T. canis<pathogen> , T. cati or A. suum genomic DNA ( gDNA) from 100 pg to 100 ag and found to be 10 fg , 1 fg and 100 fg , respectively. When larvae were spiked into chicken liver tissue , DNA of T. canis<pathogen> and A. suum was detected from the liver spiked with a single larva , while the assay required at least 2 larvae of T. cati. Moreover , the ascarid DNA was detected from the liver of mice infected with 100 and 300 eggs of T. canis<pathogen> , T. cati or A. suum. This nested multiplex PCR assay could be useful for the detection of contamination with ascarid larvae in meat and organ meats.
