  The Notch signaling pathway participates in several cellular functional aspects. This signaling has an important role in targeting both DC maturation and DC-mediated T cell responses. Thus , it is essential to investigate the influence of this signaling pathway in the role played by DCs in the pathogenesis of experimental paracoccidioidomycosis<disease> This disease is a granulomatous and systemic<disease> mycosis<disease> that mainly affects lung tissue and can spread to any other organ and system. In this study , we demonstrated that bone marrow-derived DCs infected with yeasts from Paracoccidioides<pathogen> brasiliensis<pathogen> strain 18 performed efficiently their maturation after the activation of Notch signaling , with an increase in CD80 , CD86 , CCR7 , and CD40 expression and the release of cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α. We observed that the inhibition of the γ-secretase DAPT impaired the proliferation of T cells induced by DC stimulation. In conclusion , our data suggest that Notch signaling contributes effectively to the maturation of DCs and the DC-mediated activation of the T cell response in P.<pathogen> brasiliensis<pathogen> infections.
