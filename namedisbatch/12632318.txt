  This study aims to understand the deciduous dental<disease> caries<disease> status of preschool children in Xuhui District of Shanghai , China and to analyze the associated risk factors. In January of 2016 , a cross-sectional investigation was conducted to examine the oral health of all the kindergarten children in Xuihui District of Shanghai , China. Meanwhile , a field questionnaire survey was conducted with the children 's guardians to ascertain the potential risk factors associated with deciduous dental<disease> caries<disease> Among 11,153 children , the prevalence of deciduous dental<disease> caries<disease> was 47.02 % , and the mean dmft score was 2.21. The first three predilection sites were maxillary central primary incisors , mandible second primary molars , and mandible first primary molars. There were statistically significant differences in caries<disease> prevalence and dmft among different age groups and different household registration ( Hukou) types<pathogen> ( P < 0.001). Multivariate Logistic regression suggested that the possible risk factors for deciduous caries<disease> included: older age , drinking sweetened beverages frequently , often or usually eating sweets before sleep compared to rarely/never eat them at this time , exclusive or predominant breastfeeding compared to exclusive or predominant artificial feeding and latter introduction of toothbrushing. On the other hand , Shanghai Hukou families , high educational level of guardians ( high school or college education) , regular parental support for children 's toothbrushing , guardians ' oral health knowledge , and a good perception about children 's oral health conditions were shown as potential protective factors for deciduous dental<disease> caries<disease> The deciduous dental<disease> caries<disease> status of preschool children in Xuhui District of Shanghai was still serious. The caries<disease> prevalence in Xuhui , China , is associated with children 's age , household registration type , oral health habits , feeding habits , guardians ' education level , parental perception about children 's oral health and knowledge about oral health.
