  Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) patients with Clostridium<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> co-infection ( CDCI) have an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. We aim to evaluate the impact of CDCI on in-hospital outcomes among adults with IBD hospitalized in the USA. Using the 2007-2013 Nationwide Inpatient Sample , hospitalizations among US adults with Crohn 's disease ( CD) , ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) and CDCI were identified using ICD-9 coding. Hospital charges , hospital length of stay ( LOS) , and in-hospital mortality was stratified by CD and UC and compared using Ï‡-testing and Student 's t-test. Predictors of hospital charges , LOS , and in-hospital mortality were evaluated with multivariate regression models and were adjusted for age , sex , race/ethnicity , year , insurance status , hospital characteristics , and CDCI. Among 224500 IBD hospitalizations ( 174629 CD and 49871 UC) , overall prevalence of CDCI was 1.22 % in CD and 3.41 % in UC. On multivariate linear regression , CDCI was associated with longer LOS among CD ( coefficient: 5.30 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 4.61-5.99 , P < 0.001) and UC ( coefficient 4.08 , 95 % CI: 3.54-4.62 , P < 0.001). Higher hospital charges associated with CDCI were seen among CD ( coefficient: $ 35720 , 95 % CI: $ 30041- $ 41399 , P < 0.001) and UC ( coefficient: $ 26009 , 95 % CI: $ 20970- $ 31046 , P < 0.001). On multivariate logistic regression , CDCI was associated with greater risk of in-hospital mortality ( CD: odds ratio: 2.74 , 95 % CI: 1.94-3.87 , P < 0.001; UC: OR: 5.50 , 95 % CI: 3.83-7.89 , P < 0.001). Among US adults with CD and UC related hospitalizations , CDCI is associated with significantly greater in-hospital mortality and greater healthcare utilization.
