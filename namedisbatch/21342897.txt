  The need for closer linkages between scientific and programmatic areas focused on addressing vaccine-preventable and acute<disease> respiratory<disease> infections<disease> led to establishment of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory<disease> Diseases<disease> ( NCIRD) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. During its first 10 years ( 2006-2015) , NCIRD worked with partners to improve preparedness and response to pandemic influenza<disease> and other emergent respiratory<disease> infections<disease> , provide an evidence base for addition of 7 newly recommended vaccines , and modernize vaccine distribution. Clinical tools were developed for improved conversations with parents , which helped sustain childhood immunization as a social norm. Coverage increased for vaccines to protect adolescents against pertussis<disease> , meningococcal meningitis<disease> , and human papillomavirus-associated cancers. NCIRD programs supported outbreak response for new respiratory pathogens and oversaw response of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the 2009 influenza<disease> A<pathogen> ( H1N1<pathogen>) pandemic. Other national public health institutes might also find closer linkages between epidemiology , laboratory , and immunization programs useful.
