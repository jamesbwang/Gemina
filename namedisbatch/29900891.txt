  The true burden of tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) and particularly multidrug-resistant ( MDR) TB in Sub-Saharan Africa has remained underestimated. We investigated drug susceptibility profile and genetic diversity of Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> isolates collected from confirmed tuberculosis<disease> patients in Ibadan , southwestern Nigeria. We confirmed that from 74 randomly selected Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> isolates available for drug susceptibility testing in Ibadan , in 2011 , 13.5 % of them were MDR-TB. This figure is obviously above the national and World Health Organization figures.
