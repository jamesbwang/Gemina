  A series of new azoalkyl ether imidazo ( 2,1-b) benzothiazoles were developed via a convenient synthetic procedure. The antimicrobial assays showed that a good number of the prepared derivatives exhibited significant inhibitory properties against most of the tested strains. Especially 2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole derivative 5a presented superior inhibit activity against MRSA and B. typhi<disease> with MIC = 4 μg/mL and MIC = 1 μg/mL , respectively. The highly active compound 5a showed low toxicity against mammalian cells without obvious triggering of the development of bacterial resistance , and it also possessed rapid bactericidal efficacy. Molecular docking study exposed that the active molecule 5a could interact with the active site of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> gyrase through hydrogen bond. Quantum chemical studies were also performed to explain the high antibacterial activity. Further investigation revealed that compound 5a could significantly associate with gyrase-DNA complex by mean of hydrogen bonds and could efficiently intercalate into MRSA DNA to form 5a-DNA supramolecular complex , which impart potent bioactivity.
