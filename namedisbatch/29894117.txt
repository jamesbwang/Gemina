  Previous studies investigated potential health effects of large-scale power outages , including the massive power failure that affected the northeastern United States and Ontario , Canada , in August 2003 , and outages associated with major storms. However , information on localized outages is limited. The study sought to examine potential health impacts of citywide and localized outages in New<pathogen> York City ( NYC). Along with the citywide 2003 outage , localized outages in July 1999 and July 2006 were identified. We additionally investigated localized , warm- and cold-weather outages that occurred in any of 66 NYC electric-grid networks during 2002-- 2014 using New<pathogen> York State Public Service Commission data. Mortality and hospitalizations were geocoded and linked to the networks. Associations were estimated using Poisson time-series regression , including examining distributed lags and adjusting for temperature and temporal trends. Network-specific estimates were pooled by season. Respiratory<disease> disease<disease> hospitalizations were associated with the 2006 localized outage ( cumulative relative risk ( CRR) over 0-- 1 lag day , lag Localized outages may affect health. This information can inform preparedness efforts and underscores the public health importance of ensuring electric grid resiliency to climate change. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2154.
