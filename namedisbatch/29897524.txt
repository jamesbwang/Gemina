  This study evaluated the effects of Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> CGMCC 1.921 supplementation on the production performance , cecal microbiota and mucosal transcriptome of laying hens by 16s rRNA gene sequencing and RNA-seq. A total of 144 27-week-old Hy-Line Brown<disease> laying hens were allocated into two treatments , namely , a basal diet without additions ( T0) and the basal diet supplemented with 1.0 Ã— 108 cfu/g ( T1) B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> CGMCC 1.921 , with six replicates of 12 birds in each for 24 weeks. The results showed that T1 significantly decreased feed: egg ratio compared with T0 ( P < 0.05). Dietary supplementation with B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> CGMCC 1.921 increased the Shannon index ( P < 0.05) which indicated enhanced diversity of cecal microflora. An increasing trend in Observed species index ( P = 0.072) was observed in hens fed with diets supplemented with B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> CGMCC 1.921 that showed a higher species richness. And T1 modulated cecal microbiota by increasing the relative proportion of Alistipes , Subdoligranulum , Ruminococcaceae UCG-014 , Anaerotruncus , Ruminiclostridium 5 , Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 , Erysipelatoclostridium , Ruminococcaceae UCG-009 , Family XIII AD3011 group , Bacillus , Faecalicoccus , Firmicutes bacterium<pathogen> CAG822 , Oxalobacter , and Dielma at genus level ( P < 0.05). In addition , there was a tendency of increase in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus<pathogen> ( P = 0.055) , Anaerobiospirillum ( P = 0.059) and Family XIII UCG-001 ( P = 0.054) , Peptococcus ( P = 0.078) , and Ruminococcaceae UCG-004 ( P = 0.078). Moreover , heatmap analysis indicated that the abundance of Campylobacter<pathogen> and Clostridium<pathogen> sensu stricto 1 was lower than T0. A total of 942 genes were identified by differential expression analysis , among which 400 genes were upregulated and 542 genes were downregulated. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the upregulated genes were involved in Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor ( PPAR) signaling pathway , starch and sucrose metabolism , glycine/serine/threonine metabolism , and galactose metabolism , which may promote nutrient absorption. This study provided novel insights into the probiotic mechanisms of B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> on laying hens.
