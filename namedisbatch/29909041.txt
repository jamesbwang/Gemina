  This infographic briefly summarises the natural history , replication cycle , and pathogenesis of influenza<disease> viruses , the cause of seasonal influenza<disease> and of influenza<disease> pandemics. Influenza<disease> viruses infect many vertebrates , with Influenza<disease> A<pathogen> , B and C viruses ( IAV<pathogen> , IBV<pathogen> , and ICV<pathogen>) infecting humans. High mutation rates allow the evasion of immunity. IAV<pathogen> from different host species can ` reassort ' their segmented genomes , producing pandemic strains that are antigenically novel but otherwise well adapted to humans. The ` Great Influenza<disease> ' pandemic of 1918 remains the worst outbreak of infectious<disease> disease<disease> in history. There is concern that highly pathogenic avian influenza<disease> viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes may evolve to cause similar pandemics. In humans , influenza<disease> viruses infect the respiratory epithelium. The haemagglutinin ( HA) proteins of IAV<pathogen> and IBV<pathogen> , or the haemagglutinin-esterase-fusion ( HEF) proteins of ICV , bind sialic acid , causing endocytosis. Unusually among RNA viruses , the viral genome replicates in the nucleus. New viruses assemble at the cell surface and are released by the receptor-cleaving neuraminidase ( NA) proteins of IAV<pathogen> and IBV<pathogen> or the ICV<pathogen> HEF protein.
