  Salmonella<disease> enterica<pathogen> serovar<pathogen> Typhimurium<pathogen> ( S.<pathogen> Typhimurium<pathogen>) is an important food-borne zoonotic pathogen that causes increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. The autotransporter ( AT) proteins are a large and diverse family of extracellular proteins , many of which contribute to the pathogenicity of Gram-negative bacteria. The S.<pathogen> Typhimurium<pathogen> AT protein MisL mediates intestinal colonization in mice. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that MisL clusters with ATs involved in bacterial biofilm formation , aggregation and adherence. In this study , we found that the misL overexpression increased S.<pathogen> Typhimurium<pathogen> biofilm formation. In addition , the misL deletion reduced bacterial adherence and invasion abilities on HeLa cells , but did not affect the bacterial virulence. Similarly , MisL expression in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strain promoted bacterial biofilm formation as well as adhesion and invasion capacities. However , the misL overexpression had no influence on the bacterial aggregation excepting for AAEC189Î”flu , a strain lacking type I fimbriae. Moreover , we demonstrated that immunization with recombinant MisL protein stimulated the production of high IgG antibody titers , which conferred modest protection against S.<pathogen> Typhimurium<pathogen> infection. This study illustrates the novel biological functions and immunoprotective effects of MisL in
