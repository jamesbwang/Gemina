  This study was aimed at comparing the most common two methods for gingival troughing: presaturated cord and lasers ( including diode , Nd: YAG , and Er: YAG). A total of 108 anterior teeth ( 58 maxillary and 50 mandibular) in 50 patients were included in this study. Gingival treatment was carried out in the following four groups: presaturated cord , diode laser , Nd: YAG laser , and Er: YAG laser. The gingival width and gingival recession ( GR) were measured at different times ( at the time of treatment , after 1 week , and after 4 weeks). The presaturated cord resulted in significantly higher ( P < .05) GR than lasers and narrower gingival sulci<pathogen>. Er: YAG laser resulted in the quickest and most uneventful wound<disease> healing when compared to diode and Nd: YAG lasers.
