  Urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> ( UTIs<disease>) are one of the most common types of bacterial infection in humans in various parts of the world and are caused mainly by uropathogenic Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( UPEC). A total of 58 UPEC isolates from urine were characterized by serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE). The majority of the UPEC strains belonged to serogroups O2 and O6. The UPEC strains were grouped under different pulsotypes and majority of them belonged to serogroups O2 and O6. Among the 14 virulence factors considered , 13 were present in various serogroups. The virulence genes fimH and sfa were present in all the isolates while none of the isolates carried lt-1. The strains exhibited 36 different virulence patterns , of which 11 , referred to as UP ( UPEC pattern) 1 to UP 11 were most common. Antibiotic resistance profiling of the UPEC isolates revealed that the serogroups O2 and O6 contain the highest number of resistant strains. The data from the current study depicting the distribution of UPEC strains among various serogroups and pulsotypes , and the occurrence of virulence genes and antibiotics resistance offer useful information on the epidemiological features of UPEC in Korea for the enhanced surveillance of potential emergence of UPEC.
