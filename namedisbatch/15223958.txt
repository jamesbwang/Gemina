  Gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs) are rare neoplasms of the digestive tract. The clinical behavior of GISTs varies greatly , has extended follow-up , and almost all of the tumors have malignant potential. The introduction of imatinib has led to extraordinary improvements in the treatment of individuals with GISTs ( as well as those with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia<disease> ( CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( ALL)). However , there have been notable postmarketing reports of adverse drug reactions of hepatotoxicity with the use of imatinib. By our search , among individuals taking imatinib for the treatment of GIST , only six cases of drug-induced liver injury ( DILI) have been reported. Here , we present an interesting case of an elderly woman who developed DILI after taking imatinib for the treatment of GIST. As the liver function tests ( LFTs) initially did not improve , it was decided to proceed with an interventional radiology ( IR)- guided liver biopsy , which showed a histologic pattern of acute hepatitis<disease> , consistent with DILI. Ultimately , discontinuation of the antineoplastic agent led to recovery in the patient 's clinical condition along with normalization of her LFTs over the next several weeks. Thus , it is essential that physicians remain alert for and suspect DILI for any patient being treated with imatinib who presents with a sudden elevation of LFTs. The key to making the diagnosis is stopping the offending agent<pathogen> and closely monitoring the liver enzymes for improvement. When discontinuation of imatinib alone does not lead to improvement in LFTs and the patient 's clinical status , a detailed history should be taken and initial diagnostic testing performed to exclude other etiologies. And , if they are negative , a liver biopsy should be considered.
