  We investigated trends and determinants of pulmonary tuberculosis<disease> ( PTB) in deceased South African miners. Statutory autopsies are performed on miners for occupational lung disease compensation , irrespective of cause of death. Data were extracted from the PATHAUT ( Pathology Automation System) autopsy database. PTB trends were analysed and explanatory variables ( year of autopsy , age at death , gold employment duration , silicosis and HIV<pathogen>) were evaluated using binary logistic regression modelling. Analyses were stratified by population group because of racial differences in socioeconomic status , employment patterns and access to facilities for autopsies. The analyses were segmented to represent the pre-HIV ( 1975-1989) , rapid HIV<pathogen> spread ( 1990-2004) and antiretroviral therapy ( 2005-2014) periods. The proportions of men with PTB at autopsy increased from 4.62 % in 1975 to 27.18 % in 2014 in black miners , and from 2.07 % to 5.19 % in white miners , with peaks in 2007 ( 43.12 % and 9.51 % , respectively). The magnitude and significance of adjusted ORs of determinants differed by population group and calendar period. PTB was largely associated with silicosis , increasing gold employment duration and year of autopsy ( a surrogate for unmeasured confounders , such as unknown HIV<pathogen> status and tuberculosis<disease> transmission). Changes in PTB time trends and determinants reflect the complex social and political environment in which mining occurs. Silica dust reduction remains a key intervention for tuberculosis<disease> reduction , together with tuberculosis<disease> and HIV<pathogen> treatment and management. The autopsy data provide reliable information to monitor progress towards the achievement of industry and national targets to reduce
