  Reports of calciphylaxis or calcific uremic arteriolopathy associated with acral and gastrointestinal involvement are rare. We describe a 36-year-old white woman with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis after failed kidney and pancreas transplantation who developed dry gangrene<disease> of bilateral digits , osteomyelitis<disease> , and small bowel ischemia within several months of each presentation. She had multiple d√©bridements of a septic right ankle. Computed tomography angiography showed severe vascular calcification and pneumatosis intestinalis<pathogen>. She underwent intestinal resection for gangrenous small bowel. A multidisciplinary approach with aggressive medical and surgical management may improve survival. Our case and the literature confirm the high morbidity of patients with calciphylaxis and vascular complications. Careful follow-up remains necessary for diagnosis and management to prevent complication , infection , and death.
