  The human pegivirus<pathogen> ( HPgV) , classified in the Flaviviridae family- Pegivirus<pathogen> genus , is an RNA virus identified in 1995. HPgV is a lymphotrophic virus , with replication sites in bone<disease> marrow and lymphoid tissue , as well as in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs). Transmission is through sexual and parenteral routes , and recent estimations suggest nearly 750 million people are infected with HPgV worldwide. Almost 25 % of infected individuals can develop persistent infection. Until now , HPgV has been considered a non-pathogenic virus; however , epidemiological studies suggest a potential role in lymphoproliferative diseases , particularly in the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL). The evidence of this is controversial and the role of HPgV in lymphomagenesis has not yet been demonstrated. Several studies report a high prevalence of HPgV infection in patients with NHL compared to controls and patients with other hematological diseases. Therefore , analytic studies show that HPgV could be related to an increased risk of NHL development. Conversely , other studies indicate no association between HPgV and NHL , so the role of HPgV in lymphomagenesis is not clear. This review summarizes the main findings related to HPgV 's pathogenic potential and association with NHL.
