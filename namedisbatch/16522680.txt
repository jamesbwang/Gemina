  This study aims to describe salivary beta-2 microglobulin ( sB2M) levels in our setting and to assess the performance of sB2M for the diagnosis of Sjögren 's syndrome<disease> ( SS). This cross-sectional , comparative study included 192 SS patients ( 2 males , 190 females; mean age 53.1 years; range 23 to 84 years) and 64 healthy controls ( 1 male , 63 females; mean age 46.9 years; range 21 to 82 years). Patients were divided into three groups as those with primary SS , secondary SS , and sicca<pathogen> non-Sjögren 's syndrome<disease> ( snSS). sB2M was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in whole unstimulated saliva ( ng/mL). Differences in sB2M were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Receiver operating curves were generated to determine the performance of sB2M for distinguishing between SS and non-autoimmune snSS groups , and between SS group and healthy controls. The primary SS and secondary SS groups had a significantly higher concentration of sB2M than the other two groups. There was no significant difference in the concentration of sB2M between primary SS and secondary SS groups , and neither between snSS group and healthy controls. The receiver operating curve analysis for distinguishing SS and snSS showed an area under the curve of 0.661 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.590-0.728 , p = 0.0001) with an optimal cutoff value of 0.582 ng/mL. Sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , and negative predictive value were 68.7 % , 59.3 % , 20.2 % , and 92.7 % , respectively. The reported prevalence of SS in Mexico was considered when calculating the last two values. In our setting , sB2M effectively distinguished between SS patients and non-autoimmune sicca<pathogen> symptoms. Including sB2M in our conventional diagnostic arsenal may assist in the evaluation of patients in whom SS is suspected; however , further studies are needed to clarify this hypothesis.
