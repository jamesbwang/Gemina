  We estimated the prevalence of astrovirus<pathogen> , sapovirus , and norovirus<pathogen> among patients enrolled in research protocols and receiving medical care at the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , a clinical research hospital with a large immunocompromised patient population. We identified patients whose fecal specimens were submitted to the Clinical Center for testing on the Biofire FilmArray Gastrointestinal Panel from September 15 , 2015 through November 30 , 2016. Among 442 patients with fecal specimens submitted for multiplex testing , 11 % had norovirus<pathogen> identified , 2 % had astrovirus<pathogen> , and 2 % had sapovirus. Like norovirus<pathogen> , astrovirus<pathogen> was detected in multiple sequential samples from a single patient , consistent with chronic<disease> infection<disease> or the occurrence of multiple reinfections. Coinfection with non-viral gastrointestinal pathogens was detected in 31 % of patients with positive results for norovirus<pathogen> , astrovirus<pathogen> , or sapovirus. Norovirus<pathogen> remains common in this immunocompromised patient population , and both sapovirus and astrovirus<pathogen> are present.
