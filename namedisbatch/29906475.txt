  The recent emergence and rapid spread of Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> in tropical regions of the Western Hemisphere took arbovirologists and public health officials by surprise , and the earlier transfers of West<disease> Nile and chikungunya<pathogen> viruses from the Old to the New World were also unexpected. These pandemics underscore the increasing threat of zoonotic arboviruses , especially those that are capable of entering into human-amplified , urban transmission cycles transmitted by Aedes<pathogen> ( Stegomyia) aegypti and sometimes other Aedes<pathogen> ( Stegomyia) spp. mosquitoes. This review serves as an introduction to a World Health Organization-sponsored conference to be held on June 18-19 , 2018 in Geneva , titled `` From obscurity to urban epidemics: what are the next urban arboviruses? '' It is intended to set the stage and fuel discussions of future urban arbovirus threats , how we can predict these risks from known and unknown viruses , and what factors may change these risks over time.
