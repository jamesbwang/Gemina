  Tuberculosis<disease> is the second leading cause of deaths worldwide. The inadequacy of existing drugs to treat TB due to developed resistance and TB-HIV synergism urges for new anti-TB drugs. Seventy-two benzo ( d) thiazole-2-carbanilides have been synthesized through CDI-mediated direct coupling of benzo ( d) thiazole-2-carboxylic acids with aromatic amines using a three step methodology which includes a green protocol for synthesis of ethyl benzo ( d) thiazole-2-carboxylates , precursor of the desired carboxylic acids. The compounds were evaluated in vitro for anti-tubercular activity against M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<disease> H
