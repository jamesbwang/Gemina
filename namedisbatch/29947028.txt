  Wound<disease> healing is a complex process that is essential to provide skin homeostasis. Infection with pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> can lead to chronic<disease> wounds<disease> , which are challenging to heal. Previously , we demonstrated that the antimicrobial endotoxin-neutralizing peptide Pep19-2.5 promotes artificial wound<disease> closure in keratinocytes. Here , we investigated the mechanism of peptide-induced cell migration and if Pep19-2.5 accelerates wound<disease> closure in vivo. Cell migration was examined in HaCaT keratinocytes and P2X7 receptor-overexpressing HEK293 cells using the wound<disease> healing scratch assay. The protein expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 , ATP release , calcium influx and mitochondrial ROS were analysed to characterize Pep19-2.5-mediated signalling. For in vivo studies , female BALB/c mice were wounded and infected with methicillin-resistant S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA) or left non-infected and treated topically with Pep19-2.5 twice daily for 6 days. Specific P2X7 receptor antagonists inhibited Pep19-2.5-induced cell migration and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in keratinocytes and P2X7 receptor-transfected HEK293 cells. ATP release was not increased by Pep19-2.5; however , ATP was required for cell migration. Pep19-2.5 increased cytosolic calcium and mitochondrial ROS , which were involved in peptide-induced migration and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In both non-infected and MRSA-infected wounds<disease> , the wound<disease> diameter was reduced already at day 2 post-wounding in the Pep19-2.5-treated groups compared to vehicle , and remained decreased until day 6. Our data suggest the potential application of Pep19-2.5 in the treatment of non-infected and S. aureus-infected wounds<disease> and provide insights into the mechanism involved in Pep19-2.5-induced wound<disease> healing.
